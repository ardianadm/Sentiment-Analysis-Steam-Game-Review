Positive,Dark Souls is one of the best series ever made and this game is easily 10/10 for me. Loved every single thing about it. Praise the Sun! and praise the Fire Keeper,1
Positive,"a masterpiece. If you play the game you will understand why I call it a masterpiece. It's impossible to explain with words. You can only know by feeling it. You can only know by playing and being consumed by the dark souls universe. You will ultimately become a better person the second you launch this game. I suffer from an addiction called league of legends. I was a terrible person when I played that trash game. It gave me major depression from being hardstuck gold 3 19LP. Dark Souls has changed my life for the better. It has made me better at communicating with women and ever since I launched the game nothing has come to me but pure joy and happiness. I have gotten married to the woman of my dreams. I have also started a family and I am going to get my daughter into dark souls once she is old enough. I will never let this game die as long as I live. Dark Souls is truly an amazing experience that you do not want to miss out on. It will bring you so much joy and fortune. I have never been happier, and I haven't played league in a very long time now. I dont even have the urge or temptation to even install the game. I think that if smokers played dark souls they would forget about smoking. They wouldn't even want to take time out of their day to smoke when they can just play dark souls 3",1
Positive,"DS3 is Truly amazing, I love the music, gameplay , graphics & boss fights.The game is difficult and takes time to learn but at the end is very rewarding I would highly recommend buying 10/10 masterpiece.",1

Positive,"I played this game when i was 16 years old, it was my very first Souls game and provided me with so many amazing times. I was heavily depressed at the time but this game became my home and reminded me to never give up no matter how dark things get. Here i am nearing my 26th birthday and having played all souls games, this is the one that will always be special for me, i write this as i'm reinstalling it, if you are doubting if this game is worth your money.this is your answer. Thank you and praise the sun",1

Positive,"I don't usually write reviews because most people couldn't even bother to read them. Despite this, I would say that this is an amazing game that is surprisingly dead for how good it is!Dark Souls III was my introduction into the souls universe and it was truly an amazing experience.People always say Dark souls is difficult, Dark Souls is hard. But it really isn't. It's challenging. It requires your attention. Masterful architecture, stunning graphics, wonderful level design, full of shorcuts and the fights. The tactical side behind each fight leaves so spoiled that every other game fighting mechanic seems rather simplistic and boring in comparison.Bosses are fantastic for the most part. Every bosses were unique and well designed. TBH the bosses are so good that you feel honored to be killed by them. Each boss has a personality and backstory that makes fighting them either extremely exciting or super sad. One of the most beautiful things about Dark Souls III is the music. The music is simply stunning!10/10 for me",1
Positive,"Best game I ever played my whole life. The entire experience of playing this game is outstanding.

Positive,if you dont like dark souls you will like this game,1
Positive,I played this after finishing Elden Ring and if you loved Elden Ring then it's very likely that you'll love Dark Souls 3 too. The cycle of death and perseverance makes the eventual successes you achieve all the more sweeter.,1
Positive,"Seriously, one of the best games i've ever played in my life.I've never been a fan of RPGs myself, always went for FPS games. But i got an interest for this game, for it was known for it's ""diffculty"" (more onto that later), the bosses, the sceneries, etc.I was gifted this game, and i have to say, it was one of the best gifts i've ever received.About the game itself, if you are scared to pick it up, don't. The game is not as hard as people make it out to be, it just leaves you to discover stuff for yourself, to learn the mechanics, playstyles, etc.This game is by far the best for beginners to the DARK SOULS franchise, for it has the most polished gameplay out of the three, with some more simpler mechanics.kinda of. Parries are definetely something that actually requires a bit of skill, and the same goes for backstabs, to a certain extent. You have to be more precise with stab than in previous games, but we're getting offtrack. The story is good, nothing really amazing, but the main focus of the story is good. The lore of the rest of the kingdom of Lothric (and the DLC worlds too) are what's interesting about DARK SOULS games. The lore of every boss, every area, every enemy, it's all really fascinating and well crafted, just like in other games, so it doesn't disappoint in that regard.Gameplay in itself i found pretty satisfying, but i do think the PVP part of the game could have some problems fixed (Hackers, Griefers, etc)Soundtrack in the game is also pretty awesome. There is something in particular about the Final Boss' theme that has made a lot of people really emotional (myself included). It's a really cool easter egg, but i won't spoil anything. This game's music is something you have to experience yourself to understand how awesome and well produced it is.The game in itself is beautiful. It has stunning graphics and is extremely well optimized (except for the beggining of the Ringed City DLC, all the ash may eat up your frames). All the effects, boss fights, sceneries and enemies have an immense amount of care put into them, to make them feel like they belong in this fantasy world, and to look the best they possibly can. In short, DARK SOULS 3 is an amazing game, not too far from a masterpiece in my opinion. Shame that it still has some things that should've been improved by this time, but whatever, the game is still playable. I highly recommend giving this game a try. Seriously, it's amazing.",1
Positive,good game ahead,1
Positive,"A lovely game only The Great Miyazaki could create. The aspects of Dark Souls, the series as a whole, are irrefutably unique and addictive. DS3 did a great job bringing back to the rolling i-frames of DS1 with much smoother game play, it felt completely natural. 9/10.",1
Positive,yeah this game? this game good. best game? probably. pretty good yeaaaaaah. get game. get claymore. get gud. fun game. get 100%. no more game? get sad. play game for 20th time? is very nice. Truly a Classic,1

Positive,Easily one of the most replayable games ive ever played,1
Positive,"My first souls game. I was one of those people who said the game wasn't for me. Now, after 34 hours full of rage and dying, I can say that it's one of the best game I've ever played. Praise the sun !",1
Positive,"Atmosphere is fantastic, the armour designs are kickass, the combat is faster and more refined than the previous games in my opinonvery fun, definitely recommend",1
Positive,"**RECOMMENDED AT ANY PRICE.****YOU WILL WANT TO HAVE A CONTROLLER.**one of the best, most compelling games i have ever played.ignore the hype, this game is not as difficult as you've heard, what it is is *extremely unforgiving* with almost no margin for error.it has a steep learning curve and treating this like a standard hackey slashey will get you killed very quickly, and those deaths may cause ragequits - but the game is never actually *unfair*.it is merely extremely unforgiving.you'll get better and as you get better, the game will get easier, because you've become so much better at it.and other games will feel lesser.",1
Positive,This game re-defines peoples taste on video games. Loved it. Will continue loving it.,1
Positive,I would recommend it,1
Positive,"I highly recommend this game, but understand that it isn't for everyone. Once you pass the learning curve it becomes a very enjoyable experience because of the feeling you get from overcoming a challenge.Ignore all the stupid kids yelling ""git gud"" whenever you ask for help. While ""getting good"" is definitely the primary way to pass a hard area, the game is amazingly designed so that you can always overcome the challenge somehow; whether it's by grinding, trying something else, leveling up, or asking a white phantom (a friend) for help.Don't be scarred away by the difficultly, just rise to the challenge.",1
Positive,its fun if you hate yourself,1
Positive,this game is amazing and for only 12bucks on humble bundle get it now!,1
Positive,"If you face crippling depression and anxiety and you want to further the amount you want to kill yourself, this is truly the game you have been looking for.",1
Positive,"Never thought that I would play souls game. This was my 4th attempt playing this game I think. But finally I managed to beat it! Oh God it feels so good. I was so addicted to beating the bosses. I didn't care about deaths anymore, I just wanted to beat the game! What a great experience 10/10!",1
Positive,"-The gameplay is amazingly fluid and precise.-There is verry little input lag, even if you play with mouse and keyboard.-You are able to roll diagonally towards or away from your enemies when the camera is locked onto them, instead of only letting you roll straight towards or away from them.-As to be expected by a Souls game, you have to keep an eye on your stamina bar. You cannot just reclessly keep hitting or rolling, forcing you to think wether or not you play more risky or rather safe.-Items have not only resistance/attack atributes, but also weight, so, like in other Souls games, having heavier armor may reduce the damage you take by enemy hits, but also slows your moving speed and your rolls down. The player must choose carefully what armor/weapons/rings they wear.-The soundtrack is atmospheric and the sound design in general is pleasing.-Although some soundtracks are less powerfull, they still all fit the setting and are verry high quality music with many nunances and details.-Like the other two Dark Souls games the music isnt present everywhere, giving you silence to hear the quiete background sounds of the levels and to think about where you are on your journey and what is happening. Simultaniously, because the music isnt there for the most time of playing, it makes the music all the more powerfull and impressing when it does kick in, while entering a place of great signinficance or a boss arena.-It is capped at 60 fps, but it should run on most pcs always at that framerate and it is good enough for a 3rd person role play game, wich doesnt have fast camera movements for the most part.-I havent encountered many bugs. Rarelly the game crashes, maybe a couple times a year. There are some glitches here and there, but i havent seen gamebreaking bugs so far.-The graphics might not be the best looking out there, but they are cohesive and form a nice looking world.-Shadows and lighting effects look nice and most surfaces and especially character models have sharp and detailed textures.-There are quite many settings to adjust, but antialising doesnt have high settings, so there is always some amount of jagged edges if you pay close attention.-The level design is verry well made. Many people dislike it because not all levels are completelly interconnected in a tight area like they are in Dark Souls, but it offers a wide variety of locations, in a continous world with next to none loading screens. Also you can see many parts of the world in the distance, meaning you can walk through an entire area, look back and see the places you have been, or you can look forwards beyond the edges of your current area and see parts of the places where you will later go. You may not have the same freedom as you do have in Dark Souls to go in one of many different directions from the beginning, but you still can choose to some degree in wich order to play through the areas and you can even choose to go early in late game areas. if you are a masochist or a professional speed runner, much like in Dark Souls.-Each location offers not only different types of enemies, but also different types of environmental hazards and its own setting with its own kind of beauty.-There is a plethora of different items to discover. Sure there are some items that are ""useless"" and many items you wont need for your playstyle, but there is freedom of leveling up your character and choosing the equipment that best suits your own way of playing the game. Generally speaking there is some usage for almost all of the items in the game.-Each fight is challenging and requires the player to think and make propper use of their weapons and equipment.-Combat is methodical. Every type of enemy has their own moveset and the player must understand each type of enemy and adapt their playstyle to them or use the right weapons and armor.-Running in a fight head first and attacking without thinking may have you soon surrounded by enemies and result in a fast death.-Bossfights. What would a Souls/Borne/Sekiro game be without bossfights?! The bosses here are, as expected, quite hard when you face them the first time. Some may be easy in general, but every single boss is unique, with his own skillset, moveset, strengths and weaknesses. No matter what path you choose for your character and how you play the game, there are challenges for every player type. Fights you find to be easy may be torment for others and fights wich other palyers find easy you may struggle to get through.-There is no ""perfect build"" or ""easy mode"". You must understand what you are doing wrong and correct it, or maybe even change your gear if you find your weapon, for example, being too slow or too weak for a boss you are struggling with.-The player decides on their own how they build their character. You are free to choose when you level up and how you spend your level points in the different stats of your character.-When you die you loose your ember status. To restore it (wich increases your max health by 30% and enables the ability to summon other players to your world and also to be invaded by other players, if you play online) you have to either beat the next boss or consume an ember.-Also when you die, like in the other Dark Souls games, you drop your souls and it gives you one chance to go back to the spot where you died and retrieve your souls (the currency you receive from defeated enemies, wich you can spend to level up, buy items or upgrade your weapons). If you die again before you retrieve your dropped souls you loose them.-Stroger enemies give more souls, so while you progress thorugh the game you have a higher income so to speak but also each level up increases the cost of the next level up a little bit. Also you can find souls as items and you can sell the items you find for souls.-Dispite what the internet wants you to believe, Dark Souls 3, like all Souls/Borne/Sekiro games, isnt that hard. The difference compared to other games is simply that you dont get everything shoved in your face. You have to learn through failure. The game demands from you to overcome your enemies and ""git gud"". It will never just hand a victory over to you, but the more you will enjoy every single victory, as you actually achieved it either through skill and timing or through clever use of your equipment and patience.-Dark Souls 3 has plenty of help built into it, but you decide wether or not you open the help menu and read what the stats of your character and equipment do, you decide if you stop and read the developer messages or not, you decide if you open the item descriptions and read what each item does.-The hard thing here is to learn from your mistakes, to bring the willpower to endure failure and grow to be able to succeed. You have to turn on your brain and understand the strengths and weaknesses both of your enemies and your self.Overall Dark Souls 3 delivers a verry enjoyable experience.It offers a decent challenge for new and experienced players alike, while never being really unfair.The world is immersive, the lore goes as deep as Souls lore goes and the presentation is impressive.Gameplay is verry good and the atmosphere is amazing.If you are up for a new challenge or if you are already familiar with Dark Souls and seek more of that experience i can highly recommend this game to you.On the other hand if you are verry impatient and dont like to invest time into completing a game then this is clearly not the right game for you.",1

Positive,"Dark Souls III is everything you wanted from the first Dark Souls, and leaves out what made you dislike Dark Souls II. While I will continue playing this game even after completing it; I wanted to give you guys a proper review.Environment is breath taking, and puts the earlier Dark Souls games to shame in comparison.Far more interesting enemies than humans in armor, including bosses.Nostalgia is strong with this game, and you'll love every reference thrown your way.AI improved dramatically, so enemies are going to give you a challenge.Weapon variety is great, which also applies to armor.Armor cannot be upgraded, so wear whatever you want. Fashion souls is back!If you love exploring, this game will consume you. Easy to get lost in.So many shortcuts, secrets, illusionary walls, you'll always stumble on something new.Co-op is easy to access, and hardly any problems with the server.Character creation offers a ton of options for making your character stand out.Each weapon has a special ability, making each one unique on it's own.NPCs are really developed, and don't stay in one spot. They're also very likable too.Quests are back, so you can go back to certain areas and activate new events.If you like horror films, this game has some nightmare fuel for yah.Can now get your flask out during a fight without searching through slots (hold down on down depad).Replayability is a solid option for sure. You'll most likely have multiple playthroughs.Enemies don't despawn, so you can grind to your heart's content.Your covenant changes the kind of invader you are (sunlight makes you a golden red phantom).Soul Memory is gone, so get as many souls as you want for upgrades / items.Four endings to earn, each offering a strong impact to the story.Heavily influenced by Bloodborne's mechanics, so most enemies are fast & furious.Enemies don't really have a stamina limit, so they can spam their combos for awhile.Lack of spells, hexes, miracles, and pyromancies. They're all cool, but not many to be found.PvP is sluggish, inferior to Dark Soul 2's PvP which was fun and balanced.Certain enemies can't be beaten unless you have certain items or do certain tasks.Game can feel short if you don't take the time to explore any optional areas.Until you reach more than half way into the game, weapons are hard to upgrade.Too many ambushes, which leaves you less surprised when it happens again.Most enemies have higher poise than you, so you're going to be dodging / blocking more often.Game is more demanding with graphics than Dark Souls 2, so you might need to turn certain options on low.Certain areas make the FPS drop, or lag so be ready for that.Tends to crash now and again, depending on what you're doing.Covenants are weak, and not satisfying to rank up in.Invasions / invading isn't fun because again PvP is sluggish, wonky and poorly done.NPCs can die easily from anything, so an enemy can kill them during mid conversation.Ember is hard to find, but luckily helping hosts gives you one per successful mission.NPC enemies / invaders deal more damage, have more HP & poise than you. Unfair.Can lose the chance on getting items / armor if particular quests failed.Greatswords and weapons alike are either weak or OP, there is no middle ground.Game rewards you for being aggressive & spamming over thinking carefully like previous games.Luck is useless due to the fact you can grind enemies without them despawning.Is Dark Souls III worth getting? YES. It's an excellent game and despite there's a lot of issues I have here and there with it, they did an excellent job making this game spectacular. NPCs are engaging & very interesting, bosses along with nearly every enemy possess unique designs, almost all the weapons are handy in doing something useful, co-op is very enjoyable to be a part of, scenery & the setting is absolutely beautiful (even in the areas meant to look ugly are appealing to the eye), and each build is going to be fun to experiment with. Granted, it's a shame that the game wants you to play it like you're in Bloodborne instead and most of the enemies are way to hostile & fast for their own good, but otherwise this game is a solid 8.5 out of 10 for me. Worth full price, plus we haven't even gotten the DLC yet! Hope you guys were able to get most out of my review, and please feel free to ask me any questions about the game!",1

Positive,"Wow just realised that after devoting 400+ hours and 100% completion of this title i haven't recommended it. Obviously i recommend this, its hard but not unfair the lore is extremely deep but takes a lot of investigation via item descriptions and environmental ques. but every item, every placed creature, or background furniture. Is placed with purpose to provide the story and build the tragic world you are experiencing.",1
Positive,"Dark Souls 3 is the final Soulslike game I played, having played before every other one made by FromSoftware. Visiting the same old places from Dark Souls 1, and meeting the same characters or their descendants, seeing those signs and landmarks was so special to me.I love games where there's continuity, and coming to DS3 as the final game in FS's Soulslikes catalog, and seeing familiar faces and places was the icing on the cake to me, it made the whole journey so exceptional and so real.Every time I entered a new area, to me that was my favorite area, and no bonfire was lit without a memory, or a nod back to the past and to DS1 being felt, seen, heard, or invoked in my head. This alone made the game incredibly special. How it tries to tie everything together and put an end to it all. Albeit what is an end really is up for debate, if there's such a thing whatsoever.The amount of weapons, spells, shields, and armor sets is staggering. They went all in, no matter what kind of stick you like to wield, it's here. Some of the most memorable boss fights are here, seeing good old, and grey, Anor Londo again was worth the world to me. The Firelink Shrine being displayed on my screen sent a shiver down my spine. All of Gwen and Gwynevere's statues, Onion bro, Andre, and Havel.I think whatever can be said about the gameplay or the game itself has been said before throughout the years so I would like to talk about something that was never said before, about how this game made me feel.Pathos, what the Greeks used to describe as emotions. Something that already resides in us (Dark Souls 1 (and 2) and their events) and was invoked at every turn, the linking of the fire, our duty, our sense of purpose which we remember and hold ever so close to our hearts so we don't go hollow, the state of the world, and its inhabitants, and the eternal unanswerable question, why are we here? The whole thing went before my eyes, and I find it hard to talk about now, there's just so much, I feel so much yet I can't pour it into words and I think that is exactly why I love those games so deeply. It's that elusive invisible thing that you feel as you concur the game, as you bear the duty, O branded one, of linking the fire and renewing the world for again that is your duty. And perhaps, that's simply why you are here.To me, it wasn't about gaining power, ascending, or traveling through the cosmos, all of those are themes we have seen before in their games, to me it was about doing what I was meant to do, for this fight is a fight for the flame, for my fellow kin and one where I wasn't about to squander.Prithee, Hollow, is this not what we were rallied for and to the Asylum up north sent to achieve?Prithee, Hollow, is this not why we jumped into the raging sea in Things Betwixt?And, Prithee again, Hollow, is this not why we wake up and head to our home, the Firelink Shrine, where it all first began just to end again?From a Nameless, accursed Undead, unfit even to be cinders. to a true Lord, fit to link the Fire.This is what it is about to me. It does not matter where we came from, or what we are, what matters is what we do with the little knowledge we have, in the face of the dying, crumbling, and lonely reality we are in.Similarly, IMO, it is as is our journey in real life, we know not where we came from if we had existed before, nor do we know where we are headed exactly after, if to any place. But in my opinion, what matters is the journey and, ironically, as you build your character in Dark Souls in the game, you are meant to build your human self character in real life. One and the same, and all driven by one's choices, in a world where we presumably had no choice about anything whatsoever.Our weaknesses and hollowness could never stop us from rising again and marching on towards achieving our duty, zealous as ever and brave as ever.Once a choosing undead, is now a Lord of Cinder.",1

Positive,"I rate this game: 9.5/10!1st off; This game is my introduction to the series. Dark Souls III is a game that wasn't on my radar, wasn't planning to play, didn't think I would enjoy. It is a game that viewers on my Twitch Channel (The Chronicles of Euther[www.twitch.tv]) challenged me to play. In short, Viewers were betting subscriptions -vs- me not dying more then 1000 times. I took that bet and streamed the entire game on Twitch. I died approx 700 time before 100% the base game. This game cost me two- (2) controllers. The right trigger snapped two- (2) times. It was truly an experience worth struggling (and I mean struggling) through and I invested 374 hrs in this game to date. Regarding the story line and Lore, you will have to due some reading on the internet. There are side stories, too, and you really need to pay attention to what the NPCs say, or you will miss something. No doubt.Dark Souls III is an action role-playing video game developed by FromSoftware and published by Bandai Namco Entertainment for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Microsoft Windows. An entry in the Souls series, Dark Souls III was released in Japan in March 2016 and worldwide in April 2016.It was/is critically and commercially successful, with critics calling it a worthy and fitting conclusion to the series. It was the fastest-selling game in Bandai Namco's history, shipping over three million copies worldwide within the first two months after release. A complete version containing the base game and both downloadable content expansions, titled Dark Souls III: The Fire Fades, was released in April 2017.This game will test your patience, fortitude and emotional state. I can not count the amount of times I RAGED playing this game.The game is played in a third-person perspective. Players are equipped with a variety of weapons to fight against enemies, such as special weapons, bows, throwable projectiles, and swords. Even shields can act as secondary weapons but they are mainly used to deflect enemies' attacks and protect the player from suffering damage. In addition, attacks can be evaded through dodge-rolling. YOU WILL DO THIS ALOT! I'm not kidding. Bonfires, serve as inventory, Save and Travel checkpoints. ""Ashes"", play an important role in the game (you will have to find this out yourself. Magic is also featured in the game, known as ""focus points"" (FP). When performing spells, the player's focus points are consumed. There are two separate types of Estus Flasks in the game, which can be allotted to fit a players' particular play style. One of them refills hit points, while another, newly introduced in Dark Souls III, refills focus points.Combat and movements are fast and fluid. The mechanic are will done. Several player movements (such as backstepping and swinging heavy weapons) can be performed pretty rapidly, allowing players to deal more damage in a short period of time.Throughout the game, players encounter different types of enemies, each with different behaviors. Some of them change their combat pattern during battles. You will need to spend time LEARNING (through trial and error) about each enemy to defeat them. The game places more focus on role-playing; the expanded character builder and improved weapons provide the player with more tactical options. Finally, the game does features multiplayer elements like the previous games in the series. I was really surprised how much fun I had playing with other players too. It was a blast.Finally, the visuals in this game are phenomenal! I kid you not. If that is your ""thing"", you are going to be amazed. Here is the link to my Screenshot Wall.

Positive,"This is a great Souls game, and in my opinion, a great game overall. I really enjoy the combat, audio, and if you are able to stomach the fact that the mouse and keyboard controls aren't great, it plays well with a controller.The world design is pretty good, but seems a bit linear. There are connections and shortcuts throughout the game, but the path is still one and you gotta follow it to progress through the game. The ability to teleport from each bonfire is also a proof of the linearity, since it would take ages to move from an area to the other, just by running. The story is told in a great way, for those who take their time to analyze and actually ""study"" the game environment. Storytelling is done throughout the game by environments, enemy placements, items description, drops, so on and so forth. Basically every element of this game is telling a story. This game is great. Would recommend it? Definitely.",1

Positive,"DS III is a best of souls series for me. There are a good memories about it. I just wish they had more time to complete the game as they saw it - with more bonfire mechanics and many more content. I think DS III is great game, but if final release of the game would kept world as it intended to be, it would be a perfect game for me. Still waiting for possible (?) complete edition with all cut content.",1
Positive,"DS3 delivers a great Dark Souls RPG experience more akin to the first Dark Souls than DS2. Fun boss encounters with a variety of builds possible. Would recommend installing the Cinders Mod to fix ""issues"" with base game like poise/making all builds/weapons viable. Be way of online play as you might encounter hackers & interacting with them may get you ""banned"" from the online matchmaking.Dark fantasy action combat (Souls-like) RPG If you're familiar with previous Dark Souls games, the gameplay for the most part is the same. You begin by creating a character and picking a starting class (e.g. Knight, Pyromancer, Sorcerer) with predefined stats and equipment. You progress from area to area killing monsters and absorbing souls from fallen enemies. At the world hub, you can spend your souls to upgrade your stats to make the build you see fit. Bonfires are scattered around and are basically zone checkpoints that you return to once you die, or you can teleport from one bonfire to any other bonfire in the world. You progress through the game by clearing zones and killing the zones' bosses, namely a specific set of bosses need to die before the game's final boss becomes available but you'll eventually encounter every other boss along the way. In terms of what is new in DS3 that isn't found in DS1 or DS2, DS3 introduces weapon arts to the game which are pretty much a secondary attack style/animation (besides from the L1/L2 attack) inherent in pretty much every weapon in the game. Weapon arts expunge the FP (blue) meter to use and therefore have a finite amount of uses like spells. The art style of DS3, like previous Dark Souls titles, is deliberately very bleak and oppressing. The world lacks much color and gives you an apocalyptic feeling as everything in the world is soulless and wants to kill you. The environments and game effects are nicely textured, the weapons and armor and unique and interesting, animations are great and give you a clear sign of what an enemy is attempting to do, and overall everything came together nicely. Some areas can get quite dark so bring a torch/light spell if you can't see so you don't get surprised by a mob lurking in the shadows. You play the role as the Ashen One, an undead who rises from the grave to fulfill the purpose of returning the souls of the Lords of Cinder to their thrones in order to end the curse of the undead and end the cycle of the First Flame. There's a lot more going on that you have do discover yourself by reading item descriptions and listening to NPC conversations. DS3 has a lot of lore to be discovered and if you are highly interested, there are many videos out there that explain it in much detail. DS3 feels like a return to form as most movement and combat animations are similar to the original Dark Souls. If you played DS2 and everything in that game felt/looked awkward, you'll be happy to know that's been rectified here. The game can be a great challenge for newbies and veterans alike. You are constantly kept on your toes on the lookout for possible enemy ambushes as there are plenty of deliberate item and enemy placements throughout the game. Hundreds of weapons, armor pieces, and rings to equip and create a build from. The introduction of weapon arts makes weapon choice a lot more interesting as you can choose a weapon based on its attack style/specific weapon art properties. Boss encounters are unique and fun. Only a few are gimmicked to be defeated a certain way, but otherwise you can defeat them how you want: solo, with help, with swords, with magic, etc. PvP exists in the form of covenant-based/red-orb invasions where players intrude into other online players' instances and attempt to defeat them by however they choose to. There are also unofficial but more honorable PvP locations where players duel each other and usually abide by a set of honorable rules (e.g. no healing allowed). Technically, PvP is an opt-in feature as you can disable all PvP by playing in offline-mode, but that would also disable co-op viability. The Cinders mod is touted as the ""definitive way"" to experience DS3 as it brings into the game armors and weapons from previous Dark Souls games, fixes & enhances the poise system in the base game, mixes up enemy placements in the world/adds new enemies into previous zones, creates alternate routing by connecting previously unconnected zones, and adds in toggleable difficulty settings in Firelink Shrine to make the game even harder for the veterans out there. Did my most recently playthrough of DS3 as an all-around caster using Cinders and it was great fun. Gets my recommendation for sure. Online play is a hit or miss. You can run into legit players doing some honest (or not so-honest but at least not cheating) PvP, or you might encounter someone who just one shots you (because cheats). This is a double-edged sword as interacting with hackers might get you on a banlist that matchmakes you only with other people that are also on the banlist. It's a slippery slope that I cannot provide much insight on as I haven't played online since 2016. When I last tried building a caster in 2016, I recall that it felt very underpowered/underwhelming. I don't know if casting has since been buffed, but playing as a caster felt comfortable and natural with the Cinders mod so you might want to use the mod if you decide to create a build in such a fashion.8.5/10A good return to the feeling of DS1 and a good departure from the dread of DS2. Solid RPG combat, a deep & engrossing world if you choose to look into it, and an overall fun time killing everything before it kills you. Checkbox reviews are lazy copy & paste bullsh*t. ASCII art reviews tell you nothing. ""Let's be honest, I only wrote this review for awards"" is a waste of everyone's time.

Positive,"Dark Souls 3 is the souls game that we wanted, and it is the souls game we got. As the smoothest and most refined of the trio, DS3 takes what was good in DS1 and DS2. and expands on it (aside from no power-stancing).To start, the gameplay is extremely smooth, and combat works exactly how you desire it. One of the biggest issues I had with DS2 was that combat felt clunky. That issue does not exist with DS3. Due to DS3 being a lot more modern than DS1, the combat also just feels more fleshed out. You still have your melee, ranged, magic builds, but DS3 introduces a mana bar. I still think the game was meant to be played melee, but whatever build you do is up to you.Bosses were extremely memorable and scale up pretty reasonably. The bosses in the early game are manageable even if you are new to souls, especially since quite a few of them are gimmick bosses. However, we get some of the most memorable bosses across the souls games in DS3. Whereas in DS1 we had many extremely memorable bosses, DS3 introduces a large plethora as well (DS2 bosses were overall less memorable IMO). Some of the ones I thought were most memorable include: Nameless King, Lord of Cinders, Sister Friede (DLC), Gael (DLC), Lothric Princes, Aldritch, and Champion Gundyr. What's better is that DS3 is actually quite related to DS1, and you'll even revisit Anor Londo!Map design is also excellent for DS3, and you get some of the same stuff that we loved about souls in DS3. Most of the main world is connected in some way as a big map, with twists and turns bringing you to new regions that somehow link up again afterwards. Shortcuts, hidden paths, bonfires, etc. make the map and levels really fun to get through. One of the best feelings is when you'd been grinding for a while and then suddenly open up a shortcut via an elevator or something.The only part of the game that I highly disliked is the 100% achievement hunt. DS3 is basically souls achievement grinding on steroids, because getting all the rings takes so much time. Additionally, in order to get all the different spells, you need to max out covenants. To max out covenants, you need certain drops that were meant to be received via PvP. Now if I played DS3 when it came out, this should have been no issue because there were plenty of people playing online. However, years later now the online base has dwindled, making farming covenant items much harder. If you were to farm it PvE, it has an extremely rare chance to drop in certain mobs. making the PvE grind experience super super annoying, boring, and uninspiring. I ended up sticking it out for 100% to the end, but it was not worth it.Overall, definitely one of the most fun Souls games. I highly recommend you pick the game up and give it a swing. You will not be dissappointed.",1

Positive,Very fun game some parts frustrating others just really fun and complex. The scenery in this game is cool all the way around. I myself find this game a great way to make new friends may it be invaders or summons. Really fun game. Long May The Sun Shine - Siegward of Catarina :praisesun:,1
Positive,Its an ok game I guess,1
Positive,"In the short time that I've been playing this game I've already been blown away with the return of a true Souls experience. The Combat is quick and responsive and the enemies feel much more intelligent. The first thing I noticed with DS3 over the others is how incredibly smooth it is. Dodging has never been so fun! They've added a few things to make the initial start a little less aggravating, without over-doing it and making it too easy.",1
Positive,"It's Dark Souls 3 so if you're a fan of the series then you'll know exactly what to expect - - Awesomely responsive and intuitive combat.- You'll die a lot.- An immensely detailed and dark fantasy setting.- Loads of cool weapons and gear to dress your dude or lady up in.- You'll pick up items with vague and cryptic descriptions and think ""What the fuck is this and what the fuck does it do?""- You'll die a lot.- It's HARD but fair and nowhere near as difficult as people who don't play the series think it is.- You'll die and shout at your screen something like ""Bullshit!"" and then come back and try again about 25 times.- There will be huge, scary bosses to fight and you'll think to yourself ""I'll never beat this"" and then on the 10th try you'll beat it (Summon someone to help, no one will judge you) and scream at your monitor.- You'll reach that point in every Souls game where you have to bite the bullet and do some grinding to get STRONGER!- You'll probably spend more time exploring wiki's than playing the actual game.So Yeah, it's the Dark Souls we all love and it's pretty great.",1
Positive,Amazing chest ahead!,1
Positive,"The game of Dark Souls 3 is a very fun and rewarding experience for those who really want to try it. I have had a great time playing this game, I just wish they would have done better with their anti-cheat system in the beginning. I would recommend this game in its current state to anyone I know or anyone I do not know. The pvp is frustrating, the bugs are frustrating, the game itself is very frustrating. But it is a lot of fun.",1
Positive,I never knew Dark Souls would be this fun,1
Positive,"I've played all of the Souls games, including Demon's (although never finished it to the very end). Ever since I first played Dark Souls years ago, I fell in love with the franchise. It was the first Souls experience to me. That game showed me that games can still be very challenging, with amazingly well made fantasy worlds including all sorts of nightmarish creatures. Dark Souls 3 continues the epicness the earlier ones had. I love this game, even if some moments felt impossible or quite frustrating lol. It has much of the same old gameplay mechanics from previous games, but with new additions too and the combat is mostly fast-paced.I feel like it's a great mix of Dark Souls and Bloodborne, without the dash-dodge of BB. The world itself in Dark Souls 3 is amazing in my opinion, not as well made as the perfect design in Dark Souls with those upper and lower journeys, which is the best in the series. But it's still really cool and you can basically go visit every place you see in the distance eventually. That's one thing I love about these games, to feel like you actually are in this huge unkown mysterious world. As previous games, DS3 doesn't hold your hand. You have to figure out where to go, how to fight enemies and bosses, learn their weakness and patterns to win and death will teach you again.There were few areas or enemies which I didn't like so much because of reasons, but that is a part of these games. I do love how DS3 pays tribute to DS1 in few ways, but I won't go into more detail about that.The soundtrack is soooo fantastic and introduces many cool songs, which fit well in the intense boss fights to make them even greater :D.New monster design is mostly amazing, as I said it reminds me of Bloodborne with certain opponents. Also some of the monsters feels like, as if they were taken inspiration from Berserk manga again as the creator is a fan of it, which is of course really great. I have to say that the boss design and fights are some of the best I have ever encountered, there are many memorable ones and at least 3 were really tough to me. One of the bosses felt a bit disappointing because of the way to defeat it, but was still so cool. I think I did every boss fight as solo, except one. And when you do it alone, the feeling and adrenaline rush is so much greater. The last boss of DS3 could very well be the hardest fight I've ever fought in games and I loved that, even harder than Artorias of DS1. Part of it could be because having a different build than in previous games so it honestly felt impossible, I dunno. But oh boy.it was just insane and such a thrilling fight. Lots of suffering, but eventually when you survive alone these kind of encounters, that feeling of victory is so good. I don't think many other games give that satisfaction and this is one big reason I love the Souls games. Fighting alone in the dark places, against a gigantic or just ultra aggressive bosses is simply one incredible feeling.The multiplayer is similar to DS1. When you summon friends for co-op, they can help you on the road a long time or help kill a boss which is nice. Not badly done like in DS2 where you disappear after killing a couple enemies. I've read many being disappointed with the game, like having connection issues or getting banned for no reasons. Which sucks. But I personally barely had any issues as my Chloe in my 60h+ journey, there was perhaps only 5-6 times when I couldn't enter boss fog door to help a fellow player after he summoned me. Because of connection lag, but that's it.Well it seems I ended up writing more than I first planned :). I say Dark Souls 3 is definitely a worthy send-off to the franchise, as it is informed to be the last one. An epic dark journey and amongst my most favorite experiences ever. I recommend this to those who want to experience challenging and really cool gaming moments. For fans of Souls it's a must.10/10",1

I just kept at it, inspired by the Idle Thumbs playthrough, and now I'm almost 60 hours into this character and I love it. It may be one of my favorite games of all time. Sometimes it's infuriating, but oh man, when you finally power through whatever boss or obstacle is holding you back, it's an amazing feeling.

A good storyline accompanied with extremely beautiful cutscenes will not let you fall into boredom. Just try any game from Dark Souls series: these games are absolutely funny and they are suitable for relaxation after a hard day.In total: 10/10",1
Positive,"Now, with my vast experience of every SoulsBorne game, and each of those from the Dark Souls trilogy on at least two platforms, I believe I can offer a well educated judgement of Dark Souls 3. I will be comparing it to its predecessors, naturally, but I shall also judge Dark Souls 3 as a game in its own right.So, for those that haven't played a Souls game before, and won't understand my comparisons. Dark Souls 3 is an amazing game, but don't buy it. Go play the others, at least Dark Souls 1, or I'll come to your house and slap you until you do.Right. For those experienced in souls, and want to know what Dark Souls 3 is like. Prepare to be both amazed and disappointed by this game. Dark Souls 3 keeps the complex combat of the previous games, in face goes one step further by making it so complex that it makes no f***ing sense. Diminishing returns and the peculiar new 'poise' mechanic make ultra-heavy armours mostly useless, as they weigh you down. It's fine for me, because I always had 0 poise, but for those that always killed the 4 Kings by R1 spamming in Havel's. gone are those days - but chugging is easier. As usual, there's a hell of a lot of weapon variety. Unfortunately, only a few from each class are viable, as many weapons are wholly outclassed by others in their category. The same goes for armour, but nobody cares because fashion is what's important. Despite what some say, magic IS viable in DS3 and actually remains the most powerful thing in the game if used correctly. Hyper Armour is a new addition. Certain weapon types now offer hyper armour during parts of their animations. This is good, since there is a lack of useful poise, but is very easily abused. and so 2-handed Hollowslayer is very powerful against someone who can't parry - not kidding, among the best weapons in the game.The world design is similar-ish to DS2 mixed with Demon's Souls, but the individual area design is more akin to Dark Souls 1. In general, it's bloomin' good, I just wish the world as a whole was more connected. The HUB of the game works a lot like ademon's Souls and Bloodborne. Host to your very own Maiden / Doll for levelling, merchants, a blacksmith, and gathering place for various NPCs. it feels a lot like the Nexus in this regard. It is also disconnected from the main world.The story and lore is just as expansive as its predecessors, and only more theories and secrets are coming to light as time passes. The same goes for a NPC quest lines. They are very akin to those in DS1, boasting unique encounters with NPCs and witnessing their stories unfold as yours does - take Ostrava, Siegmeyer, Solaire and Logan's quests for example. Most quests are as complex in nature, each with their own emotional and compelling story, as well as new kinds of gameplay features to improve upon the quests. Honestly, I think DS3 is host to some of the best NPC quests and characters, on par with Bloodborne and Dark Souls 1. Unfortunately, we have no Mephistopheles asking us to kill everyone, but there is one similar quest, and obvious reference.The soundtrack is amazing, on par with that of predecessors, and accompanied by equally awesome bosses. There are slight disappointments, as with all of the games, but the majority are very good. Just be warned, bosses are more aggressive in DS3.Finally, I'll summarise. Dark Souls 3 has its fair share of disappointments, but the are few enough not to tarnish the beauty of the game, and they are almost all mechanic based disappointments that may or may not be altered in later patches. The game, as a whole however, is fantastic and absolutely worth buying. PvP takes getting used to, because of the changes, it is still good. And some covenants suck, but that's nothing new. However, don't let it deter you from getting yet another FromSoft masterpiece.PS - Also. do buy that PS4 for Bloodborne, because it IS worth it.",1
Positive,"Dark Souls 3 (2016), with its thrilling gameplay and immersive world, stands as a testament to the brilliance of FromSoftware's game design.

Positive,"Dark Souls 3 is the third entry in the brutally challenging dark fantasy series created by From Software. It is a third person action roleplaying game with a focus on intense fast paced combat. The game offers many hours of content and fun amazing boss battles which really are the highlight of this game, finally beating a boss after the 20th or so time gives you a level of satisfaction unrivalled by most games out there. On top of that is some truly amazing level design and a gorgeous soundtrack. The graphics are good for its age and some locations in the game look stunning thanks to great art direction. It will also offer you a generous amount of replayability and you will discover new things even after several times beating it. Phenomenal boss battles unrivaled by other games Third person melee combat Soundtrack Level design that requires you to think Zero handholding Very fun with a group of friends Cool magic Brutally challenging difficulty Multiplayer is laggy sometimes Unsatisfactory PC port Lack of proper mouse and keyboard controls Online co-op is needlessly confusing Questionable placement of two certain bonfiresThis has to be one of the hardest and most challenging games I ve ever played. The gameplay consists of walking around decrepit environments riddled with tough enemies, secret pathways and hidden items. The level design is truly amazing, feels quite interconnected with many shortcuts and you actually have to use your brain, except for one instance where there are two bonfires right next to each other for no reason. That combat in this game is amazing with a huge amount of enemy and weapon variety and it is very fast paced with a large variety of playstyles. Are you someone who plays as a tank with a massive sword or a wizard who shoots spells? You can play as both leading to lots of replayability and messing around with weapons to find the one you like. The best part about this game is the boss battles which are so good you will find all non-Soulsbornekiro game s boss fights lacking in comparison to this game. There is also online co-op and PvP to play with friends however figuring out how the co-op works is very confusing until you get used to it. I ve rarely bothered with PvP but it s usually laggy and frustrating. The graphics are good for their age of the game and some areas look outstanding. It is also a very good game to see in motion thanks to the fluid enemy animations in combat. However, every single one of the default characters in the character creator screen look like they re constipated and have brain damage, NPC s mouths don t even move when they speak except for one and the game always looks like it has a light grey tinge to everything. The sound design is good but reused sounds from previous Dark Souls games. The voice acting is consistently good and there s not a single bad performance. The soundtrack is incredible and sounds great, you will be listening to the soundtrack on Youtube long after you re finished with the game and gotten bored. Unfortunately the PC port of this game is rather meh, no 21:9 support and It s locked at 60fps. As someone who uses an ultrawide 100hz monitor, I am rather disappointed and it is my main flaw with this game. However the gameplay is good enough for this to only seem as a minor issue in the overall experience. Also, when you use a keyboard and mouse there are only Xbox controller inputs for the UI making it almost impossible to play for people who don t own a controller. I m not a fan of RPGs, but this is an exception; it s made me want to play and finish the other two Dark Souls games, Bloodborne and Sekiro as it s just that good. Everyone should give this game a try even if they think they re not going to enjoy it.Follow our curator page: OCG-Curations if you like and want to see more reviews like this one.",1
Positive,"Finished Dark Souls 3 after an intense 11 days. With a Soul Level of 116. Spoilers from here on.In short, it's a great Souls game. It feels very focused in most aspects. Changing covenants is easier, armor upgrades are gone, stats are trimmed down, the world feels tighter, grinding for upgrade materials wasn't necessary. I also liked the slightly improved weapon infusing system. There is now a more clear way to infuse weapons with each ""elemental"" and still have stat scaling while there are ""simpler"" infusions available of each kind for better base damage output but no scaling at all. Sounds complicated when reading but it's the easiest upgrade system so far. Another mechanical change is that the camera and player movement feel more similar to Dark Souls 1 which I prefer over the feel of Dark Souls 2. I enjoyed the pacing and focused design. Reminds me of Demon's Souls.This more focused design also shows itself in the world and bosses. There are fewer bosses and the game generally felt lighter and shorter, seeing DS2. It by no means lacks content though. Especially compared to Dark Souls 2, the world feels more believable and cohesive. The areas themselves are also better designed and most importantly to me, offer much better boss encounters than its predecessor. This makes me most happy as the bosses in DS2 were for the most part lackluster. I thoroughly enjoyed almost each and every boss for their unique designs, unique behaviors and unique flow of battle. Interestingly enough I had the by far easiest time so far in any Souls game with DS3. Not sure if it stems from the experience in the series but on the other hand I've heard of friends with tales of horror about certain bosses which I managed to down on my first or second try. In terms of music Demon's Souls and Dark Souls offer more haunting and memorable tracks but there were several nice ones here that caught my attention. Abyss Watcher and Prince Lothric boss fight music namely. The cast of NPC and the questlines were well done with some personalities being nice additions to the Souls series. To my understanding this will be the final entry in the Dark Souls franchise, so it was nice to have references and nods to the whole franchise, starting way from Demon's Souls. I enjoyed reading weapon, armor, spell and item descriptions, vaguely hinting at the players past achievements but the throwbacks don't end here, by far they don't. The blacksmith is the very same Andre of Astora from the first Dark Souls which surprised me since this is taking place apparently a long time after the events of the first game. While him being the single only major identical NPC, I still would have liked it more if he at least was a descendant. Ah well, it was breaking the immersion a bit. There is a fine line between recognizing heritage and recycling and for the most part it's thankfully the former but having seen all the content, there are areas where I would not blame someone for using the word ""recycled"". Anor Londo is actually not one of those though as it was a very small area, basically a run-up to a boss, so I was absolutely fine with its appearance. Most of all it did not feel like a cheap copy-paste but made sense in the lore and world. Time passed, so it was decaying and crumbling, very well done. Sadly though the existence of Silver Knights was not only done beyond a little nod but felt copied. They added few new attacks but they were the same old Silver Knights with the same old gear, not even brittled or broken to show signs of time! That was a big immersion breaker and I did not enjoy facing them which only became sadder at the amount. The area could have become much more memorable and impactful by making the Silver Knights wear broken, torn-apart armor, maybe even broken weapons and slower, less lively behavior. The way they are depicted though is not well done.Later on when you end up in the Untended Graves there is an interesting ""Aha"" moment upon realizing it's the starting area but that gets replaced by a ""Why"" moment when you realize it's not that the original area changed its tone and time but this is a parallel world/different area?! Dynamically changing the area from a certain point in the game would have been better. You fight a variant of the same boss and later on fight Black Knights. Similarly to the Silver Knights with almost no differences to Dark Souls 1 but worse as the location does not make much sense. Shame.Thankfully these ""recycled"" occurrences were not too much, so I could forget about them once hitting subsequent areas which did not have these issues at all. All in all, I am glad that the Dark Souls franchise is ending as I want to see FromSoftware build a new world with different mechanics, different ideas without expectations & shackles that come with a franchise. From a technical point, Dark Souls 3 has network issues which I have not encountered in previous games. Frequently summoned players become glitched, lacking any animations and just glide which makes for a subpar multiplayer experience. Same happens to the player as a summon in that no enemy or boss has any animations which made for several severely anti-climatic boss fights where this issue obviously occurred for multiple summons who could hammer on a glitched boss without any repercussions. It's not the majority of the multiplayer experience but happens more often than is acceptable.Other than that the game shows stutter. It was only mildly annoying and never became a major issue for me thankfully. What did bug me were the load times when browsing through the inventory. The larger images take a second to show which annoyed me.Despite the lengthy criticism, the positives outweigh them by a landslide and the ups are much, much higher than the lows. Dark Souls 3 is a very good Souls game and stands tall on its own with many of the most memorable and enjoyable areas and boss fights in the whole franchise. I am eagerly awaiting new content, so I have a reason to play more of this gem of a game.",1
Positive,"I don't know what to say about Dark Souls 3 that hasn't been said already. The game has an incredible atmosphere, and coupled with the soundtrack, it creates a very impressive play. The gameplay is probably what most people vouch for, and they are right, it is really challenging and very rewarding. I would definitely recommend the game, especially if you have friends who already have it.",1
Positive,"This is my little Christmas present to this amazing game: a plus one from me! This is possibly my favorite game of all time. TL;DR at the bottom if you don't want to read this long love letter. ~before we begin, a small definition~ Deification (de i fi ca tion | \ d - -f - k -sh n) (noun): 1. the condition of being treated like and considered to be a god 2. The act of making something into a god People often misunderstand the goal of Dark Souls. They think it is to beat the final boss and possibly achieve some comprehension of the vaguely told story. However, I say different. The goal of Dark Souls is not to defeat a boss, but to become a boss.In Dark Souls 3, you begin as a filthy undead that doesn t know which way is up. Your first challenger is Iudex Gundyr- another failure of a warrior, cursed to be in the same wastes you were resurrected in. When you defeat him, you begin the path from nothing to everything. Soon you run through a ruin of a cursed city, searching for the Lords of Cinder- far less failed warriors than Gundyr. As is stated in the game, they are not made Lords of Cinder for merit, but for might. When you have defeated all of them, you prove your superiority. POINT DOWN.Along your journey, you kill all sorts of outcast lords and warriors. You come across other players trying to complete their own journey- some you may kill, others may kill you. Some will become your allies. You ll find that in this brutal masterpiece of a game, allies can take you a long way. Even when they are your partners in crime- as invaders. Throughout your numerous interactions with them, you will learn things, obtain new items, and gain experience. At this point you will unconsciously begin to realize the goal of Dark Souls. 60-70 hours after your first victory over Gundyr, you will arrive at the final boss of the base game. Like before, you can go alone for an ultimate challenge to prove yourself or fight with your sunbros to fulfill the quest that the story has you chasing after.Then you will begin the DLCs, which have the better parts of the game in all aspects- the most interesting weapons, the most fun and well-designed bosses, the best part of the story (which is actually really good, it just takes effort to get into). The further you go into Dark Souls, the more challenging and of higher status your foes become. By the end, you travel to the Ringed City to finish the story of the whole series. This DLC has THE BEST bosses of the series, and is a must buy if you get this game.Then you are done with the first step of your journey. Some think they are finished when they defeat Slave Knight Gael , but no. You begin NG+, and the journey repeats, but with a twist- you now have your status from before; the overpowered weapons from the lords and warriors you defeated, the experience from fighting with and against other players, the levels from the time you invested. Also, up until NG+7, the damage and health of all enemies gradually increases. It s for this reason that I think NG+7 is the true ending of the game. The ultimate challenge, the final test of all that you have learned and accumulated. You see, Dark Souls is not about beating all the bosses, it s about becoming a master of the game. It s about ascending from a lowly hollow to a lord of Lothric or the bringer of the apocalypse or a PVPer who never loses. Dark Souls is about overcoming its massive difficulty again and again until you become a part of its challenge for future players. Dark Souls is about deification- the ascent to godhood. Become a god, and then you win.And then you have the undisputed right to POINT DOWN AT THOSE FILTHY CASUALS stop playing this extremely addictive game. One of the best RPGs of all time because you truly become a part of its world, and it's not by choice- in lures you in, forces you to defeat its challenges, and lets you slowly realize that you are the center of it all, that bettering your own skill is the true goal. Role-playing so damn immersive you actually aren't role-playing- you as the player are actually the whole damn point. A game truly dedicated to itself. Everything that defines a masterpiece.",1
Positive,A perfect mix between Bloodborne and Dark Souls. 10/10,1
Positive,"overall one of my favorite games ever, ive played 100 hours on ps4 but decided to switch to pc and am shocked by how much better the quality is",1
Positive,"Watched my kids play hours and hours of Dark Souls. They were very good. Game looked awesome. I love games. I own 300+. Kids said ""dad, you have to get Dark Souls."" I said ""I have to get Dark Souls."" I got Dark Souls. I've played 5+ Hours. Still haven't beaten the very first boss. Kids looking for new dad.",1
Positive,"Love it! Dark Souls 1 was my favorite, only due to the dark feel and story. While I enjoyed Dark Souls 2, my biggest complaint was that it never felt like it had any direction, or purpose to follow. Dark Souls 3 fixed that issue, while going back to Dark Souls 1's dark gothic atmosphere. While also bringing in so much awesomeness into the combat system, with the new stances and weapon arts, the game requires a lot more planning to break enemy shields and blocks, and PvP feels more indepth. Dark Souls 3, is easily my favorite of the 3 games. However, I will say that if you're coming to Dark Souls 3 for the PvP, and expecting a change in the latency, you will be disappointed. There are still huge delays when being invaded and having to fight someone. Another thing which bothers me, while not a major thing, is if you summon someone into your world for help, you WILL be invaded shortly after, which kind of sucks when all you're trying to do is kill a boss or something, the good thing is often you are 2v1, and can easily dispatch the invader.Either way, I give the game a 9/10, would be 10/10 if the latency issues were addressed.If you enjoyed ANY of the previous Dark Souls, you WILL love this one.",1
Positive,"Dark Souls III is a decent homage to the Souls series with some quality of life improvements here and there. It is a decent Souls game, though definitely not my favorite. -Be prepared that despite how much I enjoy this game, I do have a lot of criticism.-The areas of the game look beautiful and much more lifelike than in previous titles. Bosses are also incredibly memorable due to the variance in their design and movement. It s a bit difficult to say what I like about this game that is better than in other Souls games because there frankly isn't much. It s a solid title for the same reasons that the previous entries were. From Software played it fairly safe with this title. While Dark Souls I and II had some bosses or mechanics that were incredibly hit-or-miss, at least they attempted to things that were truly different. The last entry of the series felt like it had lost more than it gainedI greatly miss the existence of any kind of static poise like the previous entries had. Considering this title is much faster paced than the ones before I felt this game would have benefited the most from it.I personally don't mind how linear this title is, though I do wish the areas felt more interconnected with one another. Things like later areas having paths that return you to previously inaccessible parts of a previous area would have made the world felt much bigger and would have made exploring more interesting.Next is the new FP system. While the FP system changed how a player controlled the number of casts they could have, it really didn't do much to change the gameplay of spell-casting itself. While I admit the system makes pure spell builds more viable for PvE, it comes at the cost of making them almost too strong in PvP depending on the build (if you've fought a lightning arrow user, you know what I mean). Because of that I wouldn't say it does anything revolutionary or new.Weapon arts leave me with mixed feelings. I love the effects of certain weapon arts such as Champion's Charge from Gundyr's Halberd or the Sacred Light and Flame from the Twin Prince's Greatsword, the latter of which is my favorite weapon in the whole game. Sadly it feels like you can never truly enjoy weapon arts because they cost FP. Most weapon-based builds cannot afford to invest any levels into attunement. And because they fight at close range, they also cannot afford to prioritize any ashen estus over regular estus. I really wish they would have made weapon arts cost weapon durability instead as they did in the previous titles for unique attacks since durability can be replenished with repair powder and it would still prevent users from being able to spam weapon arts during a fight.My final gripe is also related to weapon arts because I feel their existence is the reason one of my favorite parts of Souls games is gone. There seems to be much less moveset variety among weapons than in previous titles. Sure some were broken, but I prefer broken over boring. In DS2 we had spears with attacks from 4 different movesets and greatswords that had straight sword movesets when 2-handed. So many weapons had unique properties like this that made them each so memorable, whereas in DS3 almost every weapon from a weapon class feels identical to use with only a few exceptions.I know I sound like I hate this game at this point, but I don't. My playtime alone should be proof that I love DS3. I love it for the same reasons I loved the previous two, it's just that I don't love it for many reasons outside of those. This game had a lot of potential that I feel it missed out on. This was made even more evident to me after playing the Cinders Mod. I honestly have little to no desire to return to vanilla apart from pvp since this is the only remaining Souls game with a large enough playerbase for such. I understand why From Software took the safe route for this game and don't blame them for it. It was a good decision if this was truly the last Souls title they plan to do. I only hope they will be more innovative in future titles like Elden Ring (keep in mind I have not had to opportunity to play Sekiro myself, but it seems to be a step in the right direction).",1
Positive,"Launch issues will not be discussed because FROM knows about them, and are already working to fix everything.What is Dark Souls III? This game is the next entry into the Dark Souls series, featuring the same 3rd-person RPG gameplay of it's predecessors. It takes place in the same world as the previous titles(though now in Lothric), and includes all the expected puzzles, traps, bloodthirsty enemies, complex/beautiful environments and secrets you could ever want. Dark Souls has a brand new engine this time around, the same as that of Bloodborne; you can really feel the difference in smoothness and graphic quality.Positives:The legendary difficulty is back(they patched it in before release).This installment easily has the most in-depth fighting system of the series.The lore and narrative are still puzzles in their own right, and there's a lot of it.The game is on par for PC options.Most areas will run at 60fps if your computer is within spec. The game is beautiful.Soul memory is GONE! WOOO! Also, enemies won't disappear after you kill them a bunch.The boss design, as usual, is on point. They are all unique, scary, and challenging.The soundtracks are amazing, they come to life in the game's best moments.The game start-to-finish without doing any side stuff takes an average of 30 hours.The level design is miles ahead of Dark Souls II, you'll notice that immediately.Veterans of the series will be familiar with most systems, like sliding into a new comfy chair.Combat has been entirely reworked, down to each individual weapon. Dual-wielding is viable!Classes don't lock you into a playstyle, choose what you want and build on it. You can respec too!PVP is better than ever, especially with the new covenants!Online functionality has been expanded.Based on the ending, this is probably not the final Souls gameNegatives:The world is kind of linear in some areas, but it's not very noticeable.There are a few framerate and graphical issues. Some areas are worse than others.There is noticeable pop-in.Some grinding is neccesary. (May not be a negative for you!)Keyboard and mouse controls are just okay(using a controller is highly recommended)(Yeah, that's it. Wow.)So is it worth it?A thousand times yes. This game takes the best of the previous games and expands upon them. The Souls formula has been entirely reworked, and outfitted with the new Bloodborne engine to deliver a beautiful, polished product. Veterans should feel right at home here, as everything they know and love is in the game waiting for them. Those new to Dark Souls will have no problem using this game as an entrance to the series, as this is really, truley, the ultimate Dark Souls experience.(Did you like this review? If so, please vote it up! Feel free to add me and check out my Steam Group.)",1
Positive,"The time has come for me to touch the pen again and write something about the game where I spent the good last weeks. I want to add that this review is based on my personal experience and opinions. The following review is also based on my only one playthrough of the game (including DLCs). I would also like to thank the person who bought this game for me, as well as the person who also gifted me the available DLCs.Before starting, I will state that I have not previously played any of the Souls games series or similar, which may have contributed to how I played and how far I came. But let's not beat around the bush, it is time to enter the world of Lordran, where the flame of life begins to dim.I will start the review by mentioning of what I have heard so much, and with which I personally did not have major problems. A lot of people have spoken in a environments where I'm active that the control are terrible. I played on the keyboard and mouse myself, so I do not know how it is on the pad, but the game allows you to change everything in options, although it is very intuitive by default and you can get a feel by the first two locations what to press to achieve the effect we intend to achieve. I would like to say that the character that I eventually played was a Pyromancy Knight, so I did not have much contact with what it is like being an archer, mage and so on.As for the interface of the game, it lacks a forced tutorial for the first time, because many things can be overlooked, and all this is caused by one of the biggest drawbacks of the game - all interface buttons are still shown as if we were playing on the pad. Not once in the game did I rate the messages, because I could not figure out which button suits it. Nevertheless, it did not prevent me from enjoying the game, when at the fingertips we have Souls' Wikipedia containing information about subjects whose descriptions are not very clear - and I really recommend reading these descriptions. I sold a special shield myself which increases the renewal of stamina, just because I did not read its description and that would help me a lot.As I mentioned earlier, this is my first contact with the Souls-like game, which is why I slowly began to understand how the gameplay looks like within those. The world of the game is limited to closed locations, and most of what we see is really amazing views, but more on that later. The game as a whole is one to two lined, where the task is to move through the mazes of rooms, corridors and swamps to unlock shortcuts, illusory walls or more bonfires, until the end we encounter a boss fight. Although for some people it may seem monotonous, all locations are diverse, thought out and work well together. The exploration through them is not so satisfying by the enormity of opponents which we have to repeatedly have to break - dying more often from the hands of monsters than bosses is a normal thing.The combat system in this game is almost precise, although you can complain about hitboxes of some weapons or monsters. based upon my game as a knight, wielding a light and a great swords was intuitive, however, everything was releated to the most important rule of these games - greed. Every opponent in this game is different, so an attempt to kill him immediately can only result in an unfortunate death. The most important is the analysis of what movements they do and the appropriate response time. Often, you must dodge a few times before you attack - and the DS3 game is very punished for greed in an flurry of attacks. However, when we have enough of opponents (although I recommend fight with lots and the unique ones for special loot), there is always an escape option which I used, and somehow I managed to root out through many locations until the next bonfire.In the world of Lothric a bell sounds, signaling the fading of the flame, which protects everyone from the infinite darkness. With the roar of the bell wake up the undead, whose task is to tame the Lords of Cinder and bring them to their thrones. That's all we learn from the intro of the game and, in fact, what we should remember, because during our wander we will not see such a development of the story. It exists in the world and it depends on us how well we will be exploring to discover secrets and know more about story of it all.If we're talking about story exploration, most of what we'll find out are side quests that are completely different from what you would encounter in other games of this type. Scattered around the corners of the world, NPCs offer us their services as long as we find them alive and we will not get through the game too fast. The slight problem is that during the first wandering, we can practically omit all side tasks through their complicated and multiple paths design, hidden from our eyes (Outside of beloved wikipedia) steps that we must do to be able to complete them. Rewards for tasks are usually the constantly increasing offers from buyers, however if we skip a well or do not look at every angle, it may turn out that we do not know the full potential of the game.I mentioned this part a few times in the previous parts of the review and it does deserve a separate category. The diamond upon the crown of this game is undoubtedly the bosses with whom we will face. From cursed trees, meetings with the Vatican and swordmasters, the diversity of bosses requires us to learn how they move, what attacks they perform, find a way to read the best opportunities for attack and how many of them can be done. Although many internet lists rate some bosses extremely low, I had a lot of fun against most of them, although I had to take a break from the game for a while to regenerate the batteries before fighting the last obstacles. Some fights are a bit short in the context of how easy they can be for many classes, though they can cause problems for others. A good example would be Ancient Wyvern, which is definitely one of my favorites, but it would be best if killing her would require two or three beats, each time with a different path taken. A couple of battles are also dependent on the roll of the dice, but I am fully aware that this is not something that happens only in the third part of the trilogy.Going toward the end of review, the second most precious gem of this game is this. Through catacombs, cities and valleys, all the locations we meet and explore during the game are beautifully constructed. Many of them merge with each other in intricate corridors, and in many places we can stand and for a good few minutes to enjoy the view, exactly like the first visit in Irithyll of the Boreal Valley. I would like to mention that in terms of design on the part of the game, some of the locations do not evoke such emotions, however, if you remove opponents only to be able to enjoy eyes, they would also find inner beauty.As we are talking about audio as well, I have to mention the music and sounds that fill the universe of this game. Although I have not experienced music in the normal world, which was an unpleasant surprise for me, the music that plays during the main menu or all bosses significantly compensates for it, when church choirs or massive instruments warm up in our interiors in order to overcome all difficulties.At the end of the review, I would like to say each of its aspects gave me great fun and I hope that I will find the strength to be able to continue my adventures. Certainly I will rate the game on solid 9/10, and this is only when it comes to the base game, cause there are still waiting recommendable DLC content, about which separate reviews do not plan to write due to lack of that much content and trouble to write off them like this, for now.",1
Positive,"This game is absolutely brilliant. From Dark Souls 2 to 3 is one of the biggest redemptions I have ever seen. DS3 doesen't have that much colour to it. The most you'll see is a few gradients of grey, brown and blue. And yet, the game is stunningly gorgeous. Absolutely beautiful. The combat, just like the first two games is relatively simple, yet very very rewarding. The bosses are some of the best I have ever seen in any game. Especially the DLC bosses, they are on another level. The level design is great, but is missing a bit of interconnectivity, somehting I feel makes a world feel more real. The soundtrack is phenomal. Almost every track has a hint of melancholy to it, and thats what makes it beautiful in my eyes. It's bittersweet. This game is in my opinion the best Dark Souls game and is what truly sells the trilogy. A fantastic masterpiece, with many fantastic aspects. However, there is one glaring issue with this game I cannot ignore. The trophy hunting. When I'm trying to platinum a game, I want it to be a challenge. But not in the way this game does it. If you want all achievments for DS3 you need to put in a tedious amount of hours into farming. It's so annoying and takes so needlessly much of your time. It's such a boring way to drag out the game, and I don't know why they made it this way. Other than that, this game is a fantastic way to send off the trilogy of Dark Souls and is one of my favorite games of all time. Thank you Fromsoft.",1

Positive,"Dark Souls III is glorious that is beyond dispute. Some feel allured by its combat mechanics and challenging nature; I felt drawn in by the clandestine lore, sombre, dying world, soothing voices and, of course, grandiose music.Yet whilst contemplating the wonders of genius loci, I oft strayed and started poring over helpful texts and therein I discovered the mob. Should one dareth to voice their dissent, their skill would be called in question. In unison, the mob shall mockingly set ablaze any blemish tarnishing perfection. Their painted world must persevere.Truly, requires this game an inordinate amount of skill ? Dark Souls enforceth ways which provoke frustration and rage. It rewardeth thoroughness, keen senses, patience and nimble reactions. Ashes are in the dark, expected to crack open obscure hints most walk past blindly. One must employ mental fortitude and keep training; other than that, no especial ability is to be had. If one doth not compensate for weakness through amassing souls, all depends on dodging and remaining cool-headed.Refined aesthetes who delight in sipping the sorrows of complainers ought to consider some casters particularly struggle with the antiquated targeting system. As such, sorceries commonly fly opposite of the locked-upon enemy. Worse yet, focusing upon a draconic torso turneth the world around. For a collector, covenants constitute a nightmare as do items that vanish if one doth not venture the world in a specific order. And brawlers are ever at risk of being expunged due to nefarious invaders.Dost thou not love pain and suffering? Thou wert warned.",1
Positive,"Dark Souls 3 Is a magnificent game, just as all the other projects Miyazaki has been a part of. No Dark Souls game has disappointed me in the past, much the opposite actually, so of course my hopes were high when I first played this game. Long story short, no matter how high my hopes were, this game was able to surpass most of them.Dark Souls 3 decides to go back to It's root story telling, like in Demon Souls and Dark Souls 1. The game starts you off with a short premise, a short explanation, targets you need to defeat, and then throws you off in the world. Also going back to It's roots is the magnificent level design. Like always the areas in Dark Souls are all inertwined, rewarding the player for exploring around. Shortcuts that take you hours back, making everything more accessible and forcing you to memorize the areas so seamlessly. This way of universe building really enriches the gameplay experience and Dark Souls 3 without a doubt, delivers In that regard. A couple new classes have been added, and some removed, even bringing back the Pyromancer class, which I very much approve of. The humanity system Is a little different this time around. No Humanity or Human Effigy's but now you must use Embers. Embers will, just as the humanities, grant you the ability to summon/be invaded. Your max HP does not suffer small penalties from each death as It does in Dark Souls 2 but when an Ember is used, your max HP bar grows massively, as well as healing you, as It did in Dark Souls 1, but unlike Dark Souls 1, you may not consume an Ember after already using one. The humanity counter is long gone. (Good)In other words the Embers are the junction of all the good parts about the previous instalment`s ""humanities"". Which i very much approve of. Another notable difference are a couple new stats to upgrade. The most notorious; Luck. Luck does what you'd expect, It boosts your Luck, as a rusted coin would, but permanently. It's good for item drops. The covenants this time around also work much differently than the other games, and in my opinion for the better. In Dark Souls 3 you'll find around the world insignias for covenants, and you may at any given time, equipt which insignia you'd like. Each one of them of course, having their own benefit or draw back, regarding the type of playthrough you'd like to do. Some insignias are very easy to find, others almost impossible on your own without a walkthrough or someone telling you about their existence. Talking about walkthroughs, Dark Souls 3 continues the magical tradition of completely destroying you over and over and over and over. The combat system In Dark Souls 3 Is by far my favorite out of the others. It's much faster and the varietly is so much it can actually get a little overwhelming. This game introduces the weapon arts. Each weapon in this game has a special attack, which will take a little from you mana bar. (Also this game now uses a fucking mana bar which can be restored using a different type of estus. You'll have to balance your estus usage depending on the type of build you're making. The estus for you mana are taken from your max quantity of estus you have. This max number goes up just like in Dark Souls 2 when finding Estus Shards and returning to firelink. They did not go back to the kindle system of Dark Souls 1, so God Bless)The main Hub in Dark Souls 3 is very cool, It's not even close to be as good as Majula but It for sure has it's charm. The music is super relaxing and most of the time you just can't wait to get back and explore around the area. It would always feel great going back and finding a new npc there, or even some items that I didn't see before, even transfer boss souls, etc. But In all honestly it gets a little morbid later on, making it lose its relaxation feel, depending on how you play the game, of course.Oh and speaking of boss souls, unlike the other instalments, you may now transfer boss souls into weapons, shields, spells, miracles and rings from one of the lords of cinder, that stays in the main hub. Which Is a major convenienceBut that's actually the thing I DON'T LIKE about this game;IT'STOOEASYAlthough very excited when I finally was able to beat the game, I was also very fucking surprised by how fast I was able to beat it. I remember that the first time around playing Dark Souls 1 and 2 they took me around a week or two to complete just one playthrough, ending up to be around 60-70 hours of gameplay. I beat Dark Souls 3 In a couple days, ending up with roughly 30 hours of gameplay. All the bosses in this game, on the most part (LOOKING AT YOU WYVERN), are extremely well made, and very relentless, easily one of the best parts about it. But I never felt the same feeling I would always get while playing Dark Souls 1 and 2, the feeling of ""ooooh shit no no not right now what the fuck is this shit? this is impossible!?!?!"". Usually when playing Dark Souls 3, you just can't wait for the next boss fight cause you just want to fuck shit up, and yeah that's a great feeling, but the whole feeling of dread and knowing that you're not nearly as strong as you think you are, and that anything can just come and fuck you up at any moment the other games gave me really gave true meaning to those playthroughs. The feeling of overcoming such difficulties in the previous games where much more orgasmic.To compensate a little, the enemies is this game are usually a lot more relentless then the other instalments, even sometimes being a little frustrating, as If their stamina was infinite. All these enemies are dealed with easily If you thrive to attack them with the same aggresiveness that they have, other than staying on the defensive. Another MAJOR issue I had with this game was bonfire placement. There are literally bonfires that are less than 10 seconds apart from each other. I remember finding that very fucking stupid. Also a lot of fan service Is made in this game. The players that are more fond of the first Dark Souls game will most certainely be very much pleased with how the game plays. Areas from the first game come back, familiar faces and armour, many easter eggs and even weapons. To add in on the weapons, Dark Souls 3 decided to continue the dual wielding from Dark Souls 2 but makes It a little easier with putting both weapons for one slot. There are tons of weapons like this so you can go crazy. They also brought back the torch but actually made it as a weapon so instead of using the flaming butterflies and relying on that stupid time limit, just equip it as a weapon and you're more than ready to go. A great improvement. Poison also goes back to it's roots, not drying your whole HP bar in miliseconds like in Dark Souls 2. No more life gems. And they also decided to do the Dark Souls 2 bonfire mechanic of just lighting them up serve as a checkpoint instead of having to rest at one like in Dark Souls 1, which i appreciate. To end It up, Dark Souls 3 Is an amazing game. Lovers of the previous games will adore the adventure 100% guaranteed. Newcomers to the series, this game will for sure be a great starting point, for its the easiest, most beautiful, less cryptic, of the 3, and I love it!9/10lol jk theres no poise0/10",1

Positive,"So I am over 60 years old and fairly new to gaming in general. Jumping from Killing floor (fairly new at that also) to this gives you an idea. Before this it had been many years since playing ANY games(I owned an n64 back in the day). So, I am floored by this game. To me its amazing. I explore around sometimes doing nothing but looking around. I have gone through a fair amount of the story line - again - its all amazing to me. In short I love it. I now am branching to more games, as I find I enjoy playing more then one game at a time. I love the characters of this game, the visuals of it, and have no complaints. Occasionally I run across a very minor glitch of getting stuck or something, but this does not bother me. I do not expect perfection. But I want to emphasize this is very rare. Thank you fromsoft for making such an amazing game",1
Positive,"Dark Souls 3 is truly a masterpiece imo. let me explain why:- The soundtrack is nothing less than a fucking masterpiece. I even listen to it in my free time.- The gameplay is challenging enough to keep you on your toes and alert at all times.- The combat is a fucking masterpiece, especially the bosses. Boss fights are essentially duets with the boss performing a line and you having to answer appropriately otherwise you die. - With every boss fight you'll be dumbstruck by how amazingly thought out each one is. No two are exactly the same and each one has its unique own twist that forces you to adapt your playstyle accordingly- WAY too many games these days just hold your hand throughout the game, eager to show you all of its nooks and crannies. Dark Souls throws you in with a brief tutorial and a giant ""fuck you"" tattoo'd on your forehead before testing your metal against the first boss of Dark Souls 3 not even 10 minutes into the game.-Dark Souls kind of reminds me of Skyrim. You could be on your 8th playthrough and still find things you never knew even existed. - The lore is a whole new area to master with thousands of npc's and bosses who's stories intertwine in one way or anotherIn short this game is a fucking masterpiece and its well and truly worth the full pricetag.

Positive,"Just a fuc*ing LEGENDARY game. Very good game, nice lore, nice gameplay. I haven't seen any bugs, yeah, I'm pretty sure there is alot of bugs but I haven't seen them. I played this game something like a 100 real hours. And I can say it woithout a doubt: This is the BEST GAME EVER!Giant, sometimes almost immortal bosses, detailed open world, good lore. It's PvP there and an exellent combat system (better then For Honor's xD). I killed my FIRST boss after 2 hours of pain and suffering, but it was worth it, all that joy after the kill, I just can't convey it in words. I didn't killed a couple bosses, but I enjoed to play this game, it was alot of good time with a friend and some random people, it was a good time. At last I want to advise you to buy this masterpiece. If you have some friend or several friends, so you just MUST buy and play this game at least 20 hours. I want to warn that it's a lot of farm at the game, and don't take mage or pyromancer for the first time because it's too easy.| Enjoy this game just like I did :)",1

Positive,"Souls 3 was my first souls game. It took me some 3 hours, and 20-30 tries to beat the Gundyr, the first boss. The pure exhilaration of that final, triumphant victory hooked me for over 2 years, long after I beat the game and DLC's. I incredibly highly recommend the game to all who can afford it. Sadly nowadays the Online playerbase is mostly quiet aside from a few popular invasion areas/hard boss fights.If you strive for a challenge, this is one of the games. Ashen One, Be sure to bring more souls.",1
Positive,"A very rewarding yet unforgiving game, set in a dark fantasy world. Dark Souls 3 is or not one of the best Action RPGs out there. Having a lore-rich interconnected semi-open world, the game shows how it should be at its best. Fun boss fights, good soundtrack, beautiful environment, fun pvp, high replay value, and satisfaction from your own success are one of the many elements that this game has.10/10 buy it when whether its on sale or not. You will have your money's worth.",1
Positive,Absolutely enjoyed.wanna tell about the whole game but imma lazy guy :).as the last game of the series it ended up perfectly.loved everything. only disappointment is there is no free cam.cant take cool screenshots like wide angled ones.that's the only thing i dont like.although it would be a big APPLE cheese if the free cam was here isnt it XD.anyway totally worth for the price.so just grab it if u havent already.,1
Positive,"Excellent game , difficulty on point , multiple ending available , A huge world to explore Dark souls is known as a game to make gamers suffer and it won't change in the third one I would recommend that game only for hardcore gamers who want some challenge (better with co-op)",1
Positive,"If you're interested in Dark Souls, I recommend playing the first game first. Even though the remaster of the first game has it detractors, it runs wonderfully on both console and PC so please do not let it hold you back. DS3 has many callbacks to the first game, which made it much more enjoyable. This game does not need another positive review, but I'm going to throw my 2 cents in anyways even almost 3 years after release. Boss design is much improved over the first game. The bosses are hard, colorful and much more flashy on screen. Each boss really feels unique with no reskins like the first game (which had 3 demon bosses). I am not that good at these types of games, so I had plenty of time to appreciate each boss :) The art and environment are stunning and even the normal mobs have great detail. The only place that FROM seemed to have regressed since the first game is level design. It is so much better in the first game. This game, although more visually beautiful has a much more linear design, and the worlds do not feel as connected. Great game, and a great time to play it with Sekiro coming out this March.",1

Positive,"Just beaten it for the first time after beating Dark Souls 1 once and Elden Ring like 15+ times. Dark Souls 3 is now my favorite game in the series. Like sure a lot of bosses in the first half aren't that fun with a few exceptions like the abyss watchers, but the second half of the game is worth going through aldritch and the irithyll dungeon 100%. Dragonslayer armor, Abyss Watchers and Soul of Cinder are some of the best fights in the series and the only two fights that compare in elden ring are Maliketh and Godfrey.My main criticism is that because the game is so linear, you can't really get your build together quickly like you can in Elden Ring or Dark Souls 1. Depending on how you wann play, the game might just say ""beat half the game before you can use what you want"" and then you can't even play a different build and change it later, because that fails one npcs questline. So if you want to complete that, you can't respec and her quest is only complete after the second to last boss. For the first Playthrough I'd recommend a quality build where you level dexterity and strength equally. You will meet the stat requirements for a lot of weapons so you can just try anything out to see what you like.and use the ""talk"" option when talking to NPCs. They will usually explain important gameplay features and lore to you.anyways, 8/10 game. The first half is a bit underwhelming but consider it warmup for the second half that is insanely hard, but also where the real fun is found.I also look forward to trying the DLCs, which are just as good as the main game from what I've heard.",1

The bosses range from kind of easy to absolutely extremely horrific in difficulty, but that is what makes it exciting . You never know if you come across a boss that will devastate you or be not so bad. I am working slowly through the game after restarting because i had forgotten the mechanics of the game. Having a good time and feeling very excited when i finally beat a very difficult boss.The game runs well and has no issues in that area for me. Definitely a must play for souls players.

Positive,"After playing through Dark Souls 1, my co-worker gifted me Dark Souls 3, this time, I was very adamant on not being guided, though, and just given hints/tips to not ruin any NPC Side-Quests, which can be quite obscure. I've also beaten every single boss completely solo. I feel like Dark Souls 3 improves upon a lot of the aspects of the original, and I quite enjoyed it, even more than the first one. There's some very cool weapons, and tough as nails Boss Fights. My favorite one has to have been the Twin Princes, which I felt, was very satisfying to master, and I felt incredibly good after being them. I'm planning on playing through this game more in the future, trying out different builds and hopefully buying Dark Souls 2 as well soon.8/10",1
Positive,"Another Dark Souls and another 140+ hours gone. Here is my review broken up in different parts:As a PC port: pretty good, although I did experience BSOD multiple times. I hardly ever get this on other higher end games, including past DS games, so I suspect that this game was not 100% optimized for pc. Overall, it played well and I was able to get 4K, 60fps pretty easily. As a game: I absolutely recommend this game to anyone interested in action, adventure, RPGs, or metroidvania type games. It's totally good, often intense, and very engaging. I think the fighting mechanics are top-notch and there's so much variety in bosses, enemies, weapons that you can be entertained for a very long time. Whether you get it on sale or not, you won't be disappointed. It's absolutely worth the money. As a Dark Souls game: This is supposedly the last in the Souls series. I'd say overall it's the best, but only marginally. In fact, the innovation from 1 to 2 and 2 to 3 is pretty lacking. Don't expect a major shakeup in the DS formula. This is both good and bad for veterans of the series. It's pretty much the same game you played before, maybe with a few QOL improvements, upgraded graphics, and marginally better play mechanics. Unfortunately, they seemed to have streamlined the formula to the point where the only good weapons are swords and done away with DS2 dual wield function (which wasn't great, but at least it was there). So, in total, this is probably the best DS but honestly not that much of an evolution over the series. Criticism and praise: having played the series back to back in a relatively short time span, I can say that what makes DS great isn't really the fighting or the lore but the levels. The levels and the level design are a feature all to themselves. The masterful design and detail that made DS1 so great and was lacking in DS2 is back in full force in DS3. I absolutely love when levels open up with interesting nooks and crannies and eventually double back on to themselves with clever shortcuts and secret passages that make your progression worth the danger and risk. DS3 is at its finest in these moments. Also, the detail given to each level, all the little features that you can interact with (i.e., break) are excellent and give the levels a life of their own. Some levels in this game are done better than others, but overall all they are beautiful and fun to play through. I would have preferred a little bit more variety (you play through no less than 4 different graveyards) and maybe some totally different locations from past games (just like the past 2, you visit churches, castles, a swamp, and a run down village) but I guess that is what DS is about. The worst criticism I have with this game is that there is a very thin story that I found uninteresting and uninspired. Yes, DS has always been about digging deep to learn the lore and finding story details sprinkled in item descriptions or cryptic dialogue, but you'd think by the 3rd entry, they'd at least be able to build on the past games to give some semblance of a coherent story. That's just not the case here. In fact, it got to the point where I was running from boss to boss not knowing, or even caring, who they were are why I was doing this. Hell, I don't even know why I was killing most of the bosses in the game. Was it to the light the fire at the end? Was it to stop a curse? I still don't know. It's a shame that they couldn't build on what happened in the past games to make a story that answers all the questions and gives some finality to the series. Instead, you basically end this game just like you did with the other two. Again, this is a good port, a good game, and a good DS game. I just wish they did a lot more than make a Dark Souls 3.0, because that is what it feels like.",1
Positive,"+Good art design. Cool lore.+Polished combat. More forgiving than previous ones but harder to catch up with it because it is faster. +There are many ways to make the game easier for you, from usable items to different builds, magic and weapons.+Good item, armor and weapon variety.+Smart level design, which encourages you to try different things gameplay-wise. It also uses visual story-telling, so most of the things don't look out of place. (unless it is designed to be)+Good enemy variety.+Pretty graphics and animations.o The story is kinda obscure like older games. Which certainly gives it a charm.o It is easy to miss some NPC interactions. But they add replayability.o PVP and Co-op is a little too disconnected to the main game. Covenant rewards are pretty hard to get and not that cool. Some enemies and bosses are too easy with co-op even though some of them react accordingly with more AoE attacks. But they're still features and it's fun to play with people.o The dodge is powerful so it helps with faster builds while making slower builds relatively worse.o Shields are not good.- Dodge is too powerful for the PVP. It is mostly a shit show. It becomes too chaotic and invasions can take forever.- Armor is mostly fashion. Heavy armor does not justify dmg absorption. Poise is not affected by armor anymore(at least not enough it makes any difference). Especially when rolling is this strong. Shields are useless, so some builds are not good as they used to be. There was some gameplay value in the previous games which is not here anymore.- There are places where the game feels inconsistent. A weak looking enemy not staggering when hit while a big guy can't stand against you. A mob spamming his best move. AI pathfinding freaking out. To be fair the game is about observing the enemy before acting so it does not affect the gameplay horribly.- Some bosses are either too weak and/or don't feel special.- Mouse support is not that good but they tried.This game is not perfect but it is perfect with its flaws. It is aware of itself and does not pretend to be something it is not. The PVP and Co-op are not that good but you have to go out of your way to use them anyway. The armors are bad, but it is not like you can upgrade them like in DS1, they don't make you feel like armor is that important. Those bosses who don't feel special are not really special anyway. They're dudes who happened to be in your way. This game is a complete experience, this game is difficult, it does not hold your hand and it becomes way easier when you figure it out like every game should be. It is never unfair, it is either you or your character not suited for that part of the game. Use your items, upgrade your items and abuse the systems of the game. The game will not feel cheated if you abuse it as it tries to abuse you constantly. Play it at your pace, don't hit your head against the wall, try to go around it. And if you feel like you don't want to find another way, you can still do it your way but it might be way harder. It is okay to be upset if things don't work out, but if you don't like to get upset at times, there won't be any relief when you beat the challenge. So get ready for that.DLC REVIEWS:-Ashes Of Ariandel: Short but fun. It is worth it but does not cut it when it comes to surprising you. It has 2 nice bosses, but nothing really new. Mostly some generic enemies and a beautiful map. The painting has its own story, but it is not as interesting as the rest of the game because it feels disconnected.-The Ringed City: This DLC would be really good if it was not bullshit level hard. High HP and DMG enemies all around. One of the bosses (the optional one) is like something from WoW or a JRPG. It takes a while to bring him down as he can pretty much one shot kill you instantly. Other than that, it is pretty cool because it keeps on giving. It surprises you with traps that you have never seen in Souls series before. It shows you bits of unseen lore about the order of the Dark Souls universe. The Dark Souls series end. But these games are never about when you get there anyway. It's always the climb.",1
Positive,"Sprawling level design, thrilling combat, and masterful indirect storytelling make Dark Souls 3 the best Dark Souls yet!",1
Positive,"The game is good however you look at it. The engine is the newest of all Souls games (based on Bloodborne's), graphics, music, environments, everything is top-notch. Bear in mind that because of the said engine combat is faster paced compared to Souls 1 and 2. While there are still shields and they are viable the emphasis this time around is on rolling and dodging. (I haven't played with a shield so I cannot tell with confidence how good is the shield play.) The story is decent but most importantly it puts an end to the saga in a satisfying way while it manages to keep the world fresh by adding more lore and mythology at the same time. Make sure you play both DLCs as they are crucial to some of the deeper lore that's been seeded way back into the intro movie of the original Dark Souls.PvP is fine but with the poise debacle it's ruined for me. Poise was a good mechanic, alas FromSoftware couldn't balance it so they turned it off completely. It's a shame really. Covenants are very fun this time around, probably the best implementation of all three games.If you've played at least Dark Souls 1, Dark Souls 3 is must.",1

Positive,"Ever since I got my hands on Dark Souls 3 I was simply transfixed. All of my waking hours have been spent in an endless pursuit of souls to further grow my collection of fancy weapons, and despite praising the Sun I don't remember the last time I've seen it. I have become something alike the hollows that roam the land, utterly consumed by Dark Souls 3.At this point its fairly well known that Dark Souls 3 is good, but I don't think simply 'good' does it justice given that I am currently thinking long and hard on whether Dark Souls 1 is still my favorite game of all time. So what exactly makes Dark Souls 3 so compelling, and how does it match up against the entirety of the extended Souls family?The first thing one will notice with Dark Souls 3 is that its an evolution of all the concepts found in previous games, with the biggest influence coming from Bloodborne, what with the numerous dilapidated hamlets, dirty villagers driven mad by things far beyond their understanding, and a constant oppressive aura that spreads throughout the majority of locations. The combat is another good example as its much, much faster than what you might find in Dark Souls 1 and 2, while still retaining that slow, methodical pace we've all come to love about the Souls series.Naturally, since we as the players get better character handling, faster dodge-rolling, and overall superior combat mechanics, the monsters get their own set of upgrades as well. They are far more aggressive than in previous games, able to chain multiple attacks in order to punish you for expending your stamina, and most importantly, a fair bit smarter than the bunch that precedes them, though they still have issues grasping the concept of doors.As for the encounter design, I believe Dark Souls 2's catch phrase fits here rather well: Prepare to die! After seeing players stomp all over their games for a couple of years now, FromSoftware have stopped pulling punches, and have designed enemies and locations in such a way that they will often punish the unwary traveler, while simultaneously greatly rewarding those that think outside of the box.While Dark Souls 3 may be a brutal mistress, it does love you, so almost every time it horrifically murders you, throws you off a cliff, or has rats gnaw on your kneecaps, it also gives you a bonfire shortly afterwards, both as an apology, and as a reward for a battle well fought. The end result of this sort of level design is that I never felt pissed off after dying, instead I would keep all of my anger bottled up within me for the 30 seconds it took to run back to where I was, promptly go medieval on whoever killed me, die again because I was reckless, and then finally decide to try and approach the situation like a sane person.But perhaps the best encounter-related feature of Dark Souls 3 is that the dreaded puzzle bosses, ie. bosses that require you to deal with secondary mechanics besides simply fighting them, are for once interactive, and most importantly, fun to do. My favorite example of this is a boss fight that occurs relatively early in the game against a Wizard that is weak on his own, but is capable of spawning powerful illusions from the crystals he throws around everywhere. Instead of simply smashing his face in like you would with Pinwheel from Dark Souls 1, you will need to actually deal with the crystals by choosing on the fly which ones to destroy, and which ones to ignore as you endlessly pursue a boss that likes to run away and laugh at you. The final thing I want to mention is the exploration as the open-ended levels from Dark Souls 1 and Bloodborne are back with a vengeance. There are secrets and side-areas almost everywhere, so much so that despite considering myself an obsessively thorough explorer I managed to completely miss one boss, a fact that a friend who never even touched Dark Souls 3 pointed out to me when he noticed a hillside path I managed to completely gloss over. Worst of all for my sanity, I've found exactly one secret wall, which is just enough to let me know that they exist, and that I've probably missed dozens!There is so much more I want to talk about, but this review is already running long, so allow me to simply end with this: After playing Dark Souls 3 non-stop for the past week, the only thing I am currently looking forward to is playing even more of it. After all, I have to go back and beat the living daylight out of the damn knight that has managed to best me over a dozen times now, because as everyone knows, if you don't beat someone at first, you keep throwing bodies at them until you do!If you're interested in a more detailed review, I welcome you to either check out the written version I've done:http://www.gamesear.com/reviews/dark-souls-3-detailed-review-from-a-long-time-fanOr the video review that backs everything up with some pretty pictures:",1
Positive,"I'm a true gamer now.In all honesty, I confusingly enjoyed this game with a love/hate relationship, playing this game was enjoyably difficult but each death made me want to progress further to beat the game. It pushed me to do better the next time, which this game tests the patience of only few people. I picked this game up mid last year, played and defeated Gundyr, and then I just couldn't bring myself to challenge anymore. I dropped it and didn't pick it up again til 4 days ago from writing this review and I am happy that I did. The game in short is about the protagonist finding and returning the five lords of cinder to link the flame which basically means the player encounters various enemies and bosses throughout the game with different playstyles, abilities etc. The game is gorgeous and the cinematics are great to watch. Some bosses are definitely better than others design and control wise since some enemies are boring or too easy like Wyvern, Deacons or feel a bit broken like Two princes, minibosses.The game is enjoyable and the progression feels very player based allowing them to combo and upgrade to their preference with armor, weapons and upgrading the player with souls. It feels very open compared to other video games but this game is both very difficult and easy. The game feels like it has too many bonfires, like when defeating dragonslayer, there is a bonfire just ahead in sight making it quite pointless and unneeded to have that many at times. I feel that the game slowly becomes easier because the player is more experienced with the gameworld and enemies, their reactions and character behaviour to weapons and armor. The game is difficult but the improvement of the player makes the game easier. This doesn't however cover all since bosses like nameless knight and pontiff sulvyvahn will give difficulty no matter what (in my opinion).In conclusion, this game could go through a few tweaks since hitboxes seem a little off and walls need to act like walls rather than enemies being able to stick their spear or sword through and hit me. I also feel like the frost knight miniboss is very overpowered and the only way to defeat him is by cheesing the elevator or having him stuck on the staircase. The game is enjoyable and the lore is very indepth, the game I feel is very balanced but remove a few bonfires since it takes away how some parts are easy and the game looks great. Really enjoyable first souls game and I hope to pick up the others soon to play and experience them!8/10",1
Positive,One of the best!,1
Positive,"*favourite game of 2010-2020*This game made me feel like i was exploring a complete universe. Not complete as in ""every person walking around the main hub world is loudly complaining about the next big boss I have to go kill but only after obtaining the next item found in the chest and the weapon skill from the old man"" blah blah blah blah. Not complete in the way that there are 500 NPC's and they all live in houses that contain the exact same dinner table, bedside table and family dog. Dark Souls 3 says FUCK YOU to that kind of game play and it plops you down in Sam Raimi's ARMY OF DARKNESS (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHZQEtG8xYo). While games like Skyrim and Witcher 3 are ""huge"", they can break immersion with issues like strange enemy placement, before-mentioned chatty NPCs everywhere, and these cut-and-paste assets littering the world. Here are my PRO/CONS for all of the TL:DRsPROS-EXTREMELY ATMOSPHERIC WORLD. Beautiful.-Amazing enemy/boss mechanics and design. (mini pro: Horror fans like should delight as well)-Clean, clean, clean gameplay. Crisp hit boxes. Don't swing a large sword in a little hallway, just like in real life. ""oh but muh gameplay"" yeah but MY REALISM IS SUSTAINED.-Good RPGness. Truly infinite ways to approach the world and bosses. Want to role play as an elegant woman who fights with a rapier, but after dying many times adopts a more sinister guise as a hollowed phantom who fights with a sytche? Want to play as a barbarian who discovers the basic magical arts of the flame, and then grows into a strong, passionate pyromancer who helps others a WARRIOR OF THE SUNLIGHT (a PVP/PVE covenent)? Want to play as an Old Wizard/Witch who wants to explore the arcane arts by whatever means necessary? Want to play as an actual White Knight, protecting your online PVP waifus? Want to just say fuck it, and LITERALLY roleplay as Guts from Berserk with his actual sword? Yeah you can do that.-Fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun PVP/Co-op-Difficulty can be offset by summoning people online for bossesCons:-This game demands your attention, and if people don't approach it with an adaptive mindset then it is ""HARD GAME HARD GAME HARD GAME TOO HARD WHERE IS EASY MODE SHIT GAME"". Yeah, if you are sitting at your rig at 2:00 taking a couple of bong rips, drinking whatever weird IPA, YEAH, maybe you might die a couple times if you DON'T EVER ADJUST YOUR GAME PLAY. Same token: If you approach Dark Souls 3 the way you would approach a boss in baby games like Ocarina of Time (that is to say, acting like you'll be able to survive long to find the bosses super exploitable weakness) yeah, then you'll get squashed like spaghetti.-Overrated difficulty (THIS IS MY REVIEW AND THIS IS WHAT I THINK). When people are speed running this game with guitar hero controllers, guess what:you are approaching the game wrong if you can't beat it. The first boss of BOTW I approached (i think it was the camel? the boss killed me with a billion lasers? I had like 4 hearts and died about 15+ times, WHERE IS THE OUTRAGE FOR THAT? If 12 year olds can beat breath of the wild, you can beat a dark souls game. Nothing in this game is really that hard if you keep levelling up and you try a simple build. I have made about 5 characters and the game gets easier each time. -can't marry the firekeeper(I would recommend playing dark souls remastered AFTER dark souls 3. It is nice this way.)",1
Positive,"I like the game, there is no denying that, especially since I m close to finishing my fourth playthorugh, yet I can t be ignorant just because of that. The greatness of every component that makes Dark Souls III is crippled by its poor technical execution and I m afraid this is a result of the fans and journalists attitude towards the game. Praising without questioning has given the developers a free pass with the end result being countless bugs and problems that went unfixed throughout an entire series making their way into its finale. Dark Souls III is a good game that combines most of the great elements of its predecessors into one final blow. The impact of the finale is subject to each gamer perception towards the series. In my case, I said that the best way to improve on the series is to find the balance between its two predecessors while focusing on fixing the problems of the past and Dark Souls III did only half of that. How important each half is? I guess the time spent playing the game can be interpreted as an answer to that.Pros:+ Impressive artistic design+ Epic soundtrack+ Mysterious and captivating story+ Good level design+ Refined combat system+ Greatest roster of boss battles and the best difficulty curve in the series+ Atmospheric+ Good itemization+ Fun PvPCons:- Bugs from the previous games made it into this one with new additions- Some issues with mouse & keyboard- Linear world design with a few exceptions- Perhaps too much fan service- The graphics quality and graphics related problems- Little incentive to continue with NG+ and onwards- Weapons balance issues due to Poise stat having no effect- The lack of proper support for the Online component- Annoying lag in Online playRead the full review at:http://thegameslashers.blogspot.ro/2016/05/dark-souls-iii-review.html",1
Positive,In some aspects Dark Souls 3 is better than Elden Ring. Excellent Game! Must Play!,1
Positive,"The best game experience I've ever had <3Some points here:- Was my first souls-like game ever.- Had obviously swallowed me therefore the 100% completion- On par with Elden Ring which I've recently started. More ""vanilla"" different kind of niche!20 / 10 !",1
Positive,is good buy it,1
Positive,"This is one of those games that you'll always remember even after playing it several times. Yes, is that good enough. You feel like a fly against huge bosses that will rip you apart. To be fair, you can summon warriors from other worlds (another player) and make the game easier, but hey I didn't summon any player in my world, I'm a little crazy. I like to help people kill their bosses and get extra souls so I can level up.The graphics of this game are nice, but what really is amazing are the locations, such beauty and gorgeous landscapes. The story isn't a strong point, you have to read a lot about item descriptions, but the gameplay is what is most important in this game and the ability to play new game plus.I give this game 5/5, really loved playing it and getting all the achievements.",1
Positive,"Ashen One,You possibly might die around hundred times, but that won't break your spirit to kick that angry boss face-off. This game requires patience, strength and tactical mind, then you will achieve anything that you want.Talking about the game comparing to ds1/ds2-Beautiful graphics-Mind blowing story line-Amazing PVP-Weapon system and combatTalking about those Anor Londo nostalgic moments - makes you remember those DS1 painful moments of catching arrows etc.Possibly after finishing this game I'll try to make another build like dexbuild+miracles and those hours that I've spent on this game - no regrets!Thanks, for making this gamew/ love",1
Positive,"Update - This is by far the best Souls game compared to any ohter such games that FromSoft has made. My ranking goes as follows :-Dark Souls 3 >> Bloodborne > Dark Souls 1 > Sekiro > Elden Ring > Demon Souls > Dark Souls 2I recently finished Bloodborne, and it comes very close to Dark Souls , but it is not euql to it, because of just one thing- non-replenishable health regen items . I mean, I want to enjoy the boss battle, not take a detour to farm for Blood Vials to heal myself. The only drawback of Dark Souls 3 is the run up to the boss, which is somewhat tedious and time taking. I love the game so much that despite having completed the game on PC sometime in 2017. I bought the game again for my newly purchased PS5. -Review as on 2017 :-This was my First ever Souls game.On killing the first enemy(not the boss),I kind of felt,""Is this the game that seemed to be so difficult.""Upon encountering the first boss,""This game was not meant for me.""Now,having beaten this game,I wanna play the entire series.P.S-Game content intended for matured players,not for Weak Hearted and Patientless people.If you are reading this,then dont forget to:""PRAISE THE SUN""",1
Positive,This game ruined other RPG titles for me due to how good it isBut the DLC bosses ruined my personal wellbeing11/10,1
Positive,Better than Elden Ring,1
Positive,"Dark Souls 3 is a game that could be described as a love letter to masochists everywhere. If you ve ever wanted to experience the thrill of victory followed by the crushing defeat of being stomped by a giant, flaming dragon, this is the game for you!At first glance, Dark Souls 3 is a beautifully crafted world filled with stunning landscapes and terrifying monsters. It s like a medieval art gallery that decided to throw a party but forgot to send out invitations. You ll find yourself wandering through dark castles, creepy swamps, and even a few places that look like they could use a good cleaning. Seriously, who needs a maid when you have undead knights lurking in every corner?The combat is where the game shines or should I say, where it gleams like a freshly sharpened sword ready to stab you in the back. The controls feel tight and responsive, which is great because you ll need to dodge, roll, and possibly perform an interpretive dance to survive. One moment you ll be feeling like an invincible warrior, and the next, you ll be flat on your face, wondering how that giant boulder managed to crush you without even breaking a sweat. It s like a game of hide and seek, but the seekers are out for blood, and they know all your hiding spots.Now, let s talk about the bosses. Dark Souls 3 serves up some of the most epic confrontations you ll ever face if by epic you mean a battle that will have you questioning your life choices for hours. From gigantic, multi-armed beasts to terrifying sorceresses who can turn you into a puddle of regret, each boss is a unique challenge. Just remember, the key to victory is to learn their patterns if only they didn t change them on a whim! It s like they re trying to teach you a lesson in humility, and boy, do they succeed.The story is another layer of the experience. It s there if you look for it, hidden like a secret room behind a wall of pain and suffering. You ll pick up bits and pieces of lore as you go, and while it s intriguing, you might find yourself more focused on surviving than piecing together the narrative. Who needs a plot when you have the thrill of being chased by a horde of undead?Now, let s talk about the DLC. The additional content is like a cherry on top of a very painful sundae. It adds new bosses, areas, and gear, but also ramps up the challenge to levels that might make you question your sanity. Achieving 100% completion feels like a full-time job where the only benefit is the sweet, sweet taste of accomplishment. And let s not forget that you ll likely need to tackle New Game Plus at least two more times to unlock everything. Because why not torture yourself a little more, right? But deep down, I know I ll dive back in, because the thrill of the challenge is just too enticing.Overall, Dark Souls 3 is a beautifully crafted game that rewards patience, skill, and maybe a bit of insanity. If you re looking for a game that will challenge you to your core while simultaneously making you laugh (because you ll need it after dying for the hundredth time), then grab your sword and get ready to embrace the darkness. Just don t forget to grab a snack your next play session might last longer than you think!And despite all the pain, the suffering, and the endless dying, I give Dark Souls 3 a solid 10/10. Because in the end, it s not just a game; it s a masochistic journey that we re all secretly here for!",1
Positive,Beautiful Game <3,1
Positive,11/10 would die again,1
Positive,"Overall:Everyone already knows Dark Souls, but don't let its reputation scare you away. These games are not overly difficult. They are punishing, but are (mostly) fair. You will die quite a bit, but don't be discouraged. If you're looking for a tough but fair RPG, there's no better series. And I believe Dark Souls 3 to be the best of them. The combat is the most fluid and fast paced in the series, and has some of the best boss battles I have ever experienced. There is a lot of weapon variety, and there are many possible character builds. There is a new feature, combat arts, which are attacks unique to each weapon that add some depth to the combat. The game will not disappoint in the gameplay department. Furthermore, the game looks and sounds very good. Some of the environments From Software have created are breathtaking, such as Irithyll. Each boss also has its own unique orchestrated music track that makes taking down these foes feel all the more epic and satisfying. If you have any interest in the series, I highly recommend you give this game a shot. Online:The online components of this game are mainly Invasions and Co-op summons. Invasions are fun, but can be very unbalanced. Co-op summoning is fun if you want help getting through a tough area, or if you want to play with a friend. You can also let other players summon you to assist them. The PVP arenas also provide a good amount of value, but they are DLC exclusive. In the arena, you can fight 1v1, 2v2, or 3v3 battles against other players. You can also fight in 4-player or 6-player free-for-alls. *Some people have reported cheaters messing with their games and banning them from online play, but I have not encountered any myself.*DLC:The first DLC Pack, Ashes of Ariendel is a bit short, but ends off with one of the best bosses in the game. The Ringed City is longer and has boss battles of similar quality. The Ringed City is a fitting sendoff for the series. I found both DLC packs were worth the money, but if you could only pick one, I would get the Ringed City (Although once again I do recommend the season pass). Getting either DLC pack will give you access to the arena.",1
Positive,"After almost 2 years since FromSoft gave us DS3,there is no true challenger for this game.The single player experience is unique with great areas and hard boss fights.Pvp is very good and again FromSoft add for us some advanced mechanics (and i'm not talking about weapons art) makes it's very interesting.Overall Dark Souls 3 is a must have for players who want's more challenge in their experience of playing a game",1
Positive,"this was my first ever souls game that i had ever played and beaten. This game is insanely good. The music, the enemies, the bosses and the npc's are so well written and unique that its hard to compare a game this good to anything else. The last boss fight made me so anxious and when i finally killed him after a couple of tries, it was a feeling unlike any other game has given me before. 10/10",1
Positive,Slave Knight Gael is the greatest Souls boss ever. A suitable ending to this greatness of a series.,1
Positive,"I just finished this game which is my first souls game, and I just had to write a review for it. Before I start, I have to say that if you are planning to buy this game, you should buy it ASAP because my biggest regret is not discovering this game sooner.This was a very fun game in my opinion in terms of its skill cap. It was very fun clearing areas finding new items and beating the mobs that would stand in your way. Exploring the beautifully designed world of Lothric is also always worth because of its amazing aesthetic. The weapons system was also quite enjoyable to me because discovering new swords, armors and spells always opened my options to more character customization and broadened my view on more ways to play the game. In regards with the bosses, they gave me a whole load of happiness by doing them. I found it fun learning how to fight them, to dodge their attacks and learn their weaknesses in order to succeed. Each boss victory, with the exception of the relatively easy ones, gave me always gave me extremely happy leaving me with feelings of accomplishment. With the lore however, I found that the game itself actually doesn't give you much details. You would have to watch a couple of youtube videos to learn it. This doesn't mean though that the lore isn't good. The lore for me is very exciting and fun. The story and the world of Dark Souls is in my opinion one of the best in all the games I have previously played.For anyone who reads this, I hope you find this review useful.",1
Positive,"hard and fun, you don't need a controller like everyone says. Use whatever you're more comfortable with.",1
Positive,"Just beautiful, nothing wrong with this game. Best with sunbros!",1
Positive,It truly has been a journey.This game has made me experience all the emotionsand gave me many fond memories of the strange and wonderful people I met along the way; including both NPCs and players. Dark Souls will forever be something special to me and is the type of game where there is always more to explore in this beautiful melancholy world. I await Miyazaki's next Masterpiece and until then I'll continue to fight my battles sword in-hand; thus I highly recommend this game.,1
Positive,This game has a special place in my heart. Such a thing of beauty.,1
Positive,"You know, I initially planned on just finishing this game just once with the Ursurper of Fire ending, aka the best one, then move on to Elden Ring, which y'know, reasonable.Here I am, on my third run as John Sekiro after finishing Sekiro, Sharp Uchigatana +10 only, parry as much as possible. I am addicted. I haven't even touched Elden Ring yet. Please stop me. I am too hooked.I am not good with analyzing details of games, I'd rather have fun and experience them. So here is the gist of my first-time experience with this game.FromSoft is world-class in terms of worldbuilding and setting the atmosphere. Even in the gameplay, I felt uncertain heading towards the next area, afraid that my weapons or stats will not even be feasible. But then I just kept on heading onward. And man, the feeling of barely scraping by and surviving endless counters gets my heart pumped. Early game Dark Souls experience are always unmatched in terms of uncertainty and ambiguity for your experience up ahead.As I progressed through the game, I got more gear/armor/magic, leveling up my character little by little, it was maybe baby steps but I was getting more powerful, I was improving myself as a player. I started to recognize enemy patterns, I was able to fully read Lothric Knights' moveset. And you know how fast their movesets are lol, really overwhelming at first. I was stuck at Dancer at one point and I kept going back to challenge her every time i upped my weapon stats or soul level. I did not give up, I knew I was improving because I started to be able to dodge through her attacks and read what she was able to do next. It f e l t s o g o o d.Anywai gud game git it, even if it never goes on sale. It's still worth it full-price. Fromsoft deserves your hard-earned cash.",1
Positive,"Dark Souls 3 is pretty cool, I guess.You play as an Ashen One, a champion destined to defeat the lords of Cinder and link the first flame, a sort of beacon that keeps the light in the world while at the same time keeping the darkness at bay.I think.After beating up a large man with a coiled sword in his stomach and a very angry tape worm living inside him, you find yourself in a temple called the Firelink Shrine, which is looked after by this cute lady that has a very long list of chores for you to complete while you're out. The Firelink works as your home of sorts, it's the generally safest place and all of your friends live there. But it doesn't have a couch or broadband internet, you could probably sit in one of those giant chairs that one of the lords of Cinder used to sit in, I guess. I can't really go into much detail about the plot without spoiling a lot of things, so instead I will dance around talking about it like I'm playing the floor the lava. Dink Rolls 3, like it's predecessors, is an action RPG in the same vain of games like Blade of Darkness and Crusader: Might and Magic. While making your character, there are a multitude of options outside of just making them look like Gargamel from the Smurfs. You can choose where this character comes from, which doesn't do anything but change the general back story and appearance, but you also get to pick a starting class. In the long run, and much like a communist state, class doesn't really matter, but it can be used to give a head start to whatever stats you actually want to level up during the course of the game.Combat handles almost like two mustached gentleman having a boxing match, unless you're fighting one of the many monsters that lie in wait, in which case in turns into you hoping that it doesn't try to eat you with its horrific chest mouth. Your characters left and right arm are assigned by default to the triggers or bumpers on your controller or to your mouse. You can also lock on to your enemy so you can strafe around them and you don't end up being smooshed because your shield just so happened to be pointing the wrong way. There is a surprising amount of diversity to the combat, you can play as a shield bearing knight or SHOTGUN WIZARD to be sure, but the equipment and stats really help how you shape your play style. You can just go it as a knight or mage, sure, but weapons are assigned to your hands rather than your character itself like other RPGs. Putting a staff or a charm in one hand and a sword in the other will allow you to cast spells as well as whack anything that gets too close, just like using a shield in both hands will let you block doorways for others and giggle at them like the massive jerk you are. Drake Souls 3: Hotline Bling also has this neat online feature like it did in the other Souls games. Others playing the game can leave messages that can warn, inform, or screw with others. The game will also leave blood stains on the ground to show you where other chumps had died so you can either avoid the danger or stand in amazement at how some people can get killed in this game. But most prominent, and arguably most important, is the coop and PVP features in the game. While embered, which is this games equivalent of having humanity, you can find summon signs on the ground that allows you to summon others into your game. This other players will help you defeat the area and it's boss in return for an ember upon success. Or more than likely they'll be killed in your place so you can trek on while they make a splat on the floor. Kind of like a Loony Toons episode. But maybe you aren't going to be a helpful little ghost that beats up monsters for others. Maybe you want to be. THE BAD GUY! Throughout the game you can find these little red orbs, or one big infinite red orb if you do something for someone. These red orbs allow you to invade other peoples world as a red phantom. As a red phantom, you must kill the host player in return for a few rewards. You don't even have to kill him yourself, actually, you can just have the world do it for you. Though be warned, because that can backfire through another of the games items I'll leave for your to discover. All these online features really work to enhance the general experience of the game. It makes the lonely journey not feel so lonely now that you know there are others on the same crusade as you are. It can also work as a motivator showing you that it's not as hard as you thought if others could do it. There are also these groups in the game you can join called Covenants, which work as a sort of guild system for the online community. Each Covenant has their own thing going on as well as their own goals.The world of Dan Souls 3 is fairly large and expansive in it's own way. While the world of Dark souls 1 was like a ball where everything is connected, the world of Dark Souls 3 is more like a branch, with a main road that breaks off into a plethora of curious locations. There's always this sense of wonder and treachery when you embark on a new quest through a dangerous area, something that the second game seemed to lack since none of the areas didn't seem all that connected. Like how the top of a windmill led straight to hell. Getting immersed into Dark Souls 3 almost makes you feel like a Witcher, if that makes sense. While you can just go through the game and reach the end, there is a lot of reward for exploring and finding secret areas and dungeons that you may have not had to visit during your journey. You learn about the world around you by paying attention and scrounging for lore through various NPCs and items you obtain along the way. The items and equipment you pick up each have a description ranging from just the use of the item itself to the origin and history of the character it may or may not be related to. They don't seem all that important, but sooner or later things begin to click and you start to understand the world around you a little bit more. The boss battles is where Dark Souls 3 really shines, some of them are lame, sure, but most of them feel like a climatic end or halfway point of your expedition into a dungeon or a cave or a castle or whatever. Bosses are fast, vicious, and hit hard, forcing you to think on your feet. They challenge your reflexes and decision making skills and you feel like a true hero when you manage to make a boss look like a fool by dodging all of their flashy and powerful attacks.BUTShould you play Don King Souls 3: Screwing Mike Tyson? It stands as a nice end to a series. As much as I would prefer if From was known for their games about robots dashing at one another aggressively, I can see how Dark Souls became their most venerated series. It's a game that I can see pulling people into the series and making them interested in the previous games in the series. Is it crushingly difficult as some people make it out to be? No, but it's challenging, it expects a certain amount of competency from the player and doesn't want to just hand things to you. Its kind of lame to see articles and videos floating about on the internet of people who's entire job revolves around playing video games wishing that the game had a easy mode just because they were unwilling to learn and adapt to the games mechanics. Which is why you should listen to me, Dirk.Dark Souls 3 is the kind of game that expects you to actually sit down and play the game, be engulfed in it's dark and foreboding world, learn and connect the pieces that make up it's lore. Is it the best RPG ever made? No, and if you didn't like the other games in the series, I doubt you'd like this one. But is it a fantastic game? Definitely. Dark Souls 3 gets 5 heavily armored camping trips out of 5 and the Dirk Dickbutt stolen Oscar award of approval.",1
Positive,"I quite enjoyed DARK SOULS III. Although the world is not as branching and connected as DARK SOULS I there are some areas that do have a similar flow to them, where one bonfire joins several paths together through the use of shortcuts. The gameplay is incredibly fast and fluid in comparison to the first two Dark Souls games, something that I was not prepared for during the early hours of the game. I loved the game so much I kept going until I had unlocked every achievement.I know some players took issue with the amount of throwbacks and references to the previous games with recurring characters, locations, and items from the previous two Dark Souls, even Demon's Souls, but I didn't mind at all. The original Dark Souls is the end of the beginning so by the time DARK SOULS III comes around there is an established ritualistic and recursive behaviour in regards to the fading flame. Just like in real life where the world is constantly changing, each civilisation's forgotten history falling victim to entropy, so has the world of DARK SOULS III.DARK SOULS III is difficult but far easier and simpler game to play than the original. Player movement is so fluid and the amount of invulnerability offered when dodge rolling is a huge boon to the player, it's hard not to view it as an exploit. I never bothered with PvP in the previous games but that changed here; after overcoming my nerves I found it incredibly addicting to the point where I'd stay up until 4am messing around as a Mad Phantom just to confuse the players I'd invade.While DARK SOULS III does have its issues in regards to broken mechanics - such as poise not working properly, hackers, and wonky collision systems - it manages to improve on the formula due to some necessary quality of life changes and technical optimisation. I consider DARK SOULS III to be a seriously amazing game, a satisfying closure to the series, and I hope never to see it revived.",1
Positive,This is definitely one of the hardest game i have ever played. But if u like to torture yourself than this game is for u.,1
Positive,very amasing :),1
Positive,"The PvE in this game is very good. If you're buying it for that (which I assume most people are), then it's definitely worthwhile. Similar in quality to (the first half of) Dark Souls 1, maybe even a bit better now that poise actually works. World layout isn't as good though.The PvP on the other hand.dear lord, it's the worst of the 3 Dark Souls games. By a lot. Flawed in a lot of very frustrating ways. And of course From has literally no idea how to balance weapons, so some weapons and weapon classes are just plain worthless. Nothing new there.",1
Positive,"What's a better way to celebrate beating this game than writing a review for it with adrenaline still rushing through my blood. Admittedly, being a hardcore long time Souls fan, I went into this game quite late as I've only recently acquired a gaming computer of my own. And Dark Souls 3 was an amazing journey that makes that wait worthwhile.My tale of coming across the Souls series was that of a happy accident. It was on an used Xbox 360 my parents bought for my 15th birthday that I discovered still locked achievements for a game called Dark Souls. And for reasons unknown, little me was drawn in immediately, perhaps by the icons for the achievements itself. So I set out immediately in search of this elusive RPG game that just came out a few years prior. Before I know it, I was hooked, dragged into a rabbit hole of bloody, exhilarating adventures; becoming a die (try) hard fan of the franchise. That also sparked my interest in extremely difficult games later on and subsequently a passion for roguelikes.Now at the end of a short trip down the memory lane, comes the actual review for the game itself. As most may know, the difficulty in Souls game have reached an almost legendary meme status where they'd be compared to a slightly hard game. And DS3 was no different, albeit the game in my opinion feels a less challenging than the first one. The game, however, made up for it in the way of clever enemies, maps and bosses' design. Most if not all of the bosses from the game have two phases to their fights, forcing the player to switch up tactics - a feature not common in previous titles. For example, my favourite boss fight is with the Dancer - avoiding any spoilers here - has the first phase consist of primarily clearly telegraphed attacks but as soon as the second phase rolls in, its attacks become much faster, much more dangerous to dodge nilly willy. As with other games made by From, lore and storytelling plays a very important role in their games. And this aspect is even stronger in DS3 with more lore hidden among item descriptions, even more NPCs with their individual quest lines to complete, all with their own very satisfying ending. And in my opinion, story elements in DS3 are strongest in all of From's games.Dark Souls are incomplete without amazing pieces masterfully crafted by various talent composers that literally breathed soul into these games - all the boss fights would feel extremely empty without these sounds in the background. The soundtrack of DS3 is no exception and I find myself listening to them from time to time to get a quick boost in morale.In short, Dark Souls 3 is an unforgettable experience is a definitely must have for all the Souls fan. Here's to more hours in this amazing franchise. P.S: if you're trying Souls game for the first time, I'd highly recommend the more clunky but amazing nonetheless first Dark Souls, preferably skipping the second game - the black sheep of the family, and finally finishing with Dark Souls 3, before moving onto Sekiro and Bloodborne.",1
Positive,Hey! Thats pretty good!,1
Positive,"Devs: How much swamp do you want in our game?Miyazaki: Yes""Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll meI ain't the sharpest tool in the shed.""8/10",1
Positive,"Dark Souls 3 is the supposed end of the series, and finds many amazing ways to wrap it up. I'll be doing my personal feelings on the game, at least rating wise, instead of looking at it like a critic. The very first thing I want to say, is that you can play the games in order of 1, 2, 3, but in my personal opinion, an order of 2, 1, 3, would be better for most players. Dark Souls 1 and 3 have many similar elements and are more closely tied together than 2 > 3. Now to get onto the ratings for this specific installment of the Souls series.Story: 9/10 - The story, like all of the other SoulsBorne games, are stories that aren't directly told, but more found by careful exploration and looking at every tiny detail the game offers. For people who want a more direct story telling, this can be frustrating at times, as you might find yourself thinking 'Why am I doing X or Y?' but for those who want to try to find the story based off of context clues and small details, it's perfect. Subtle details make the world feel more alive and connected, and make forming these own connections yourself that much more rewarding. If you find yourself wondering what the lore is behind something specific I might recommend looking it up on YouTube, as there are many wonderful people who cover the subject.Gameplay: 9/10 - The gameplay is similar to Dark Souls 1, instead of Dark Souls 2, which has its pros and cons. Pros - Quicker, sharper, with a bit of the realism taken away, which in a fantasy game is fine. Cons - PVP is a bit overwhelming at times, especially if you're new to the game, there will be people who have played the game for years now, and just do invasions to kill and trick brand new players. People say 'Easy Peasy, Lemon Squeezy', but in cases like this, if you're starting the Dark Souls series with this one, I'd like to say 'Difficult Difficult, Lemon Difficult'. There can also be times however where you find some of the funniest and friendliest people, randomly gesturing, helping you through levels, or dropping you end game items that you otherwise wouldn't get until the end of the game. Really anything happen. The SoulsBorne community is nothing if not random.Besides that, if you're the type of person, like me, who enjoys learning by mistakes, blood, sweat, and tears, it's definitely a good style for you, and the amount of reward you feel after defeating a boss you've been struggling with for hours/days is amazing.Customization: 8.5/10 - A large part of what I enjoy about Dark Souls 3 in particular, is the difference and variety in builds you can do for PVE. From an assassin using magic to make themselves quieter, to knights using faith to slam lightning into their enemies, to a bowman ducking and weaving between enemies to pelt them down, there's something for everyone's style of play. Some fit better at different times than others, and if you truly don't like your build you can respec once you reach a certain point in the game. Appearance wise you can also take the time to make your character appear however you want, but if you wear a helmet you won't be seeing your characters face much at all.Music: 10/10 - Maybe perhaps the best part of the entire SoulsBorne series, the music is near flawless and always beautiful. From the most melancholy piece, to the most epic, the music is something that tugs at the heartstrings in your soul and truly makes you feel for this dying world. Nothing bad to say about the music anywhere, other than I could use more and more.All around: 9/10 - This game is nearly perfect in many aspects for me, but falls short in a few others as well. The story is wrapped up very well (depending on which ending you go for), the combat is very finely tuned, and as you go through the game you feel the world struggling on-wards, attempting to live its last breath. The area where the game falls short is playing through after your first time, it feels much much shorter. It's VERY easy to miss certain NPC quest line. Certain ones can't even be completed without playing through the game multiple times, so if you're a completionist, be prepared to do multiple playthroughs. Final Thoughts: I highly recommend this game for anyone wanting to be engrossed in a decaying world, one that is difficult and gritty, but rewarding at the perfect times. Beauty abounds and difficulty astounds, but with time, perseverance, and a bit of luck, you'll find yourself enjoying one of the best games of the last decade.",1
Positive,It was my first souls game and I will be revisiting all the priors just because i would like to play more souls. It was a semi-rough journey with a learning curve since it was never a series I really got myself into. But Once I learned i thrived and honestly it is one of the most rewarding experiences you can ask for.,1

Positive,"I love this game more than I love first Dark Souls. This game is more fast peaced than previous two and even more challanging. But every time you hit a wall you will try and try to climb over it untill you succeed and feel sweet satisfaction of victory!Pros:- Great combat system- Great story- NPC side-quests force you to explore world even more (but are worth it)- Amazing soundtrack- World design (it's beautiful and clever)- Enemy and bosses design- Challanging, sometimes even hard, but not impossible- Jolly co-operation!- THERE IS NONE FUCKING BLIGHT TOWN!Cons:- You will get hit through walls- Enemies unlimited fp/stamina- Camera can and probably will screw you with 25 inch dilldo- Laggy PvP- PvP douchebagsTips?

Positive,"In my adventures to find games to play I stumbled upon Dark Souls 3 (DS3). Six years ago, I started playing the game with an old friend but put it down due to finding other games to play at the time. Well, for the past few weeks, I have been playing DS3 and I have to honestly say that I wish I played this game a lot sooner. I love everything that this game has to offer and the builds you can make in the game are amazing.ProsWonderfully crafted story in its world-building and item descriptionsChallenging gameplay that will make you think about your next moveOptional side quests that are actually fun Many different builds to use and try outBeautiful graphics that make the areas amazing and creepyConsSide quests either have specific or small windows when they are availableNow, I can t really talk about the story of DS3 simply due to the fact that it s not told directly to you. The story of the game is mostly interpreted by the community so you will have to take it from there. The remainder of the story is mostly found on item descriptions and its world-building, which is also not told to you directly but just by looking at it you can get a feel for the world. From the buildings you see to the enemies/bosses you fight, it s all unique in many ways and I love it.I am someone who loves Dark Fantasy stuff and DS3 doesn t necessarily need to have a story for me to fully watch. I loved how the world also has a bunch of influences on the Berserk series and I can even see some of the comparisons in the game.Now whichever Dark Souls game you play, they are all known for their gameplay being difficult in many ways, although it should, of course, be worth noting that difficulty is subjective to everyone. However, I will say that DS3 is a challenging game in its own right. There are tough enemies to deal with around the corner and challenging boss battles that you can go and beat. You are given some tools to help you deal with the bosses and if you have a friend who also plays the game, you can summon them to help you in the boss fight as well.After you kill an enemy or boss, you will be given Souls. These Souls will give you upgrades to stats. Strength will help you carry heavy weapons more easily - if you don t meet the proper strength, you won t swing the weapon properly. Dexterity also helps as it makes you carry more weight and if you don t meet the requirements for that, the weapon will bounce off enemies. Endurance will help increase stamina, which gives you the ability to do more actions like attacking, etc. Vigor will give your character more HP, which is good for survivability when fighting enemies or bosses.I could go on for more about the stats in this game but that is pretty much a whole review on its own for me to talk about. There are soft caps and hard caps for all the stats in the game so there will be a point at which you will get less than the usual level per stat you increase.There are also a few starting items you can get to help you at the beginning of your run. One thing I have to note is that no matter what item you start with, you can get everything else in the game. Including the item you start out with, whatever you get will only give you what you start out with. Unfortunately, though, there is no Master Key like in the first DS game. That s fine as you can travel pretty much to any bonfire at the start of the game.With that in mind, there are also a ton of different weapons, armor, and builds that you can use in the game. You will have to meet certain stat requirements to use some of the weapons or armor so sometimes you will have to farm for Souls. There is magic in the game but it s ok for the most part, you can use spells as you do have a magic meter, and doing a magic build is possible but it s an investment. You will need a high faith level to use some of the best spells and to do damage, thus making you a glass cannon of sorts.After defeating a boss, you will be awarded a Boss Soul. These special Souls can be used to acquire new weapons. Or you can use them to get extra Souls to get extra stats for you to level up, do note that if you do this you can t recover the Boss Soul unless you fight it again on New Game+.There are times when you have to go back to certain areas or explore the world in some way to progress through the story. While you may get stuck, you can explore the world or if you want to look up a guide, there is no shame in doing any of this as some of the info you get is vague.There are also some side quests and optional bosses that you can fight that can give you some nice rewards. They add things to do in the game and it s always nice to do other activities in DS3, the game offers quite a few things to do and explore and it s worth it to try the optional quests.Although I mentioned that some of the info that the game gives you is vague, well that also applies to the side quests as well. As they either have a specific or small window of them being open and if you progress in the game, you will be screwed over from doing it. You can beat one boss for you to only be locked out of a side quest because you did not speak to a certain NPC on the other side of the map. It s not the player's fault for this, it s just FromSoftware never gave you any hints or cues to do certain things.DS3 is a very beautiful game, the areas you visit look dark and depressing but have some sort of undead-life feel to them all. It makes you want to explore what lurks around every corner. NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 3GB, AMD Ryzen 5 1500X Quad-Core Processor 3.50, and 16 GB of RAM, I experienced no issues while I was playing and got a constant 60 FPS while playing.Dark Souls 3 is one of those games that I wished I picked up sooner to play and I am honestly glad that I finally found the chance to experience the game. I had a ton of fun playing it and this has encouraged me to try out the other games in the series. I even went and bought the DLC's which were a ton of fun to play and explore throughout. I highly recommend this game to fans of the Dark Souls series or to those that are wanting to start out with it. There is a ton of replay value to have, and the game even has multiplayer.Ahh, another one, roused from the sleep of death to review at Life Needs a Little Sin for good quality reviews",1
Positive,"First of all, the changes affected the design and elaboration of locations, which became much more interesting to explore in order to move forward. There were some lore additions directly related to what happened in the first part. The world has completely rotted and needs the beginning of a new era, which only those who are not worthy of becoming ashes can do. Ashen One (ash), called the Fire Keeper, is controlled by the player, forced to travel a long way to fight the Lords of Ash, returning them to their thrones in the Firelink Shrine. With these actions, Ashen One must end the Age of Fire and begin a new one, thereby putting an end to the curse of the undead.Dark Souls' lore has always been boss-based, so I'll highlight Aldrick, Devourer of Gods. Has an interesting backstory, character model and, in my opinion, attacks. Yes, they are borrowed from Gwyndolin the Dark Sun and other characters, which looks impressive in the compartment. Lothric, the younger prince and Lorian, the eldest prince also do not leave indifferent, leaving a taste of sadness at the end.Added storylines that are easy to miss because some actions are impossible to figure out. Concerns Henri from Astora, bringing a good ending. It follows that you need to be constantly vigilant so as not to miss small details that can seriously affect the outcome. Otherwise, if you carefully examine the locations, communicate with NPCs and read the descriptions of the loot, it will not cause any difficulties.The big problem with Dark Souls remains cheaters who enter the world like red phantoms. It is unpleasant to lose coal because of guests who are not capable of a fair duel. This would include pinging, which is additional pain in one place, since it is difficult to cause damage. This does not apply to players who create mini-bosses and provide a real opportunity to win. Overall, if you are in the right place at the right time, red phantoms are not a problem.There was only one major bug - a failure under the textures after the battle with Abbys Watchers. It was so surprising, and the pools of other people s blood confirmed that this was not an isolated incident.If the previous parts of the series did not work, then this one should be given a chance to prove itself. Must have by default. And I'm ready to marry her.",1

Positive,"Honestly, this might be my favorite From Software game. Sure, it doesn't have the pure innovation of Demon's Souls or Dark Souls, but it polishes both of those games and adds the better parts of Bloodborne to make a nearly perfect experience. DS and even DeS have some of my favorite levels, but DS3 puts it all together in a beautiful package. Once you start getting to the later parts of this game, you really feel like the devs went above and beyond in that way to make the best of all worlds type of game. I don't think anything will match my first moments in DeS, but this one sure has me hooked and the coop is really solid, making it a more friendly game in some respects.The graphics are the best From has put out period. After the horribly janky 30FPS of Bloodborne, damn this just feels right. Perfect image quality and 4K at 60FPS with a 1080ti or better. Turn DoF off for a nicer look with full detail. I could not ask for more in visuals department outside of clipping fixes.The story and lore is probably a tad redundant by now. I still have very little emotional connection to the hero, and I just don't buy the less is more theme anymore. From really needs to invest in some better storytelling. I don't want or need Witcher 3 type dialog scenes every 5 minutes, but I do want to to care about the characters in the game. They should take a page from Ghibli films to assert their conservative approach with a bit more heart. Outside of that, this is still a great package with decent bits here and there. Much better than Bloodborne for me.From has some quality characters in here, and the bosses are great fun, yet it just need a bit more detail and complexity to the characterization of those at hand. Places like Irithyll are just stunning and the best the series has ever looked, but this game goes beyond that in the DLC and in general most areas are about the best they can do at this time for the Dark Souls vibe. The connective environments are amazingly resonant, and looking at the castle as you move in and around it during the beginning is brilliantly done better than any other of their games. From has really crafted a spectacular world here full of great detail.I feel like you can critique some of the balance though. Too many rings are useless, and I really wish they would have tweaked that aspect to make the builds a little more varied. Certain swords seem to immediately assert dominance, but after you get to the middle there are a lot of options with weapons and spells. Overall, the usual complaints from a From game of course. I didn't find this one too hard at all. Plenty of bonfires and coop make it almost too easy in parts, but you can treat that part how you want to make your own difficulty. For me I didn't want to struggle too much so I did some cooping for once, and it was a blast all told. You definitely still need to be very careful in certain areas, so it's not like the game is giving you free passes. And at this point in time you won't get coop spawns all that much anyway, though, the community is still active to this day in late 2024.Both the DLCs add a lot to the base game and completes the package well. I have never been one for multiple playthroughs, but they offer plenty for Souls enthusiasts with DS3. I can't see how any Souls fan would not recommend this. The controls are back to amazing after the horrific controls the B team peddled in DS2. No more awful deadzones, no more weird acceleration curve. This one feels great to maneuver with in all respects. The atmosphere, sound, and visuals are overall From at the top of their game. It's definitely an homage to their entire work as a studio, but it stands tall as a great game in its own right.",1

Positive,"I have so many positive things to say about this game that I honestly don't know where to begin.I guess I'll start with the difficulty.The game is extremely difficult, I mean it's Dark Souls, I don't think anyone is surprised by that.If you're not familiar with Dark Souls games, all of them are very difficult but that's exactly the point and half the fun comes from overcoming the difficult challenges that the game presents to you.I'm a newcomer to the Dark Souls series, and this is the first souls game that I've played and finished.I liked it so much that by the end of the game, it became my favorite singleplayer game of all time.If you're not up for the challenge and do not like trying to learn boss patterns, I don't think this game will be your cup of tea.Even regular enemies are tough and some of them may make you want to scream and smash your controller against the wall.There is no tutorial, the game doesn't hold your hand at all, and you're pretty much on your own from the beginning.YOU have to figure out where to go, what to do, what items do, which weapon is the best for you, which armor to wear, which stats to level up, how to beat a boss, etc.I liked the UI in this game a lot, it's very simple and doesn't have a bunch of obnoxious UI elements that cover up half of your screen. It's small, useful, and simple, and the menu is really easy to navigate!Boss and level design are so far above average games, it's unreal.Every boss looks good and unique and has his own attack patterns.Every area in the game has its theme and is very fun to explore.It's very rewarding to get an upgrade or a new item from just exploring the world, everything has its purpose and a lot of things have interesting lore behind them.Unlike most other games, in Dark Souls, you have to work for it in order to get lore.You have to look for NPCs in areas of the game and talk to them to get bits and pieces of the lore, which later you have to put together in your head.If you want even more lore, you can read the descriptions of various items.The game uses environmental storytelling and doesn't just serve you everything on the plate.In terms of replayability, I'd say that it's worth replaying the game multiple times to get different endings and fight your favorite bosses a few more times.The game has a feature called NG+ which allows you to replay the game with the same character and not lose any items (except specific ones like keys) and keep your levels, spells, weapons, etc. There are a few optional areas and bosses in the game that you can easily miss if you're playing for the first time which is one more reason to replay the game.Gameplay is very fun.There is rolling and attacking, those will be 2 main things you're gonna use, of course, there is more to it like weapon arts, spells, parrying, blocking, and things like that, but I found myself using mainly roll and attack buttons, and I think that's how it is for the majority of players, especially new ones.There is a ton and I really mean A TON of different weapons that change how you play the game depending on which one you're using.On the one side, you have slow but hard-hitting weapons such as greatswords (which is my personal favorite), and on the other side, you have fast but lower-damage weapons like katanas and daggers.Don't let anyone tell you you're using a bad weapon or your build is bad because you can beat the game with any weapon if you practice enough, and if you're REALLY good you can also beat it on level 1, naked, and by using nothing but your fists.The graphics are pretty decent considering it's an almost 7 year old game, but that is not very important in my opinion and you should not expect much in that department.Dark Souls 3 runs well on older systems and you shouldn't have problems running it even on higher settings if you have even a somewhat competent PC.There is also PVP if you play in online mode, but I haven't tried it yet so I cannot comment on that.If you're really having trouble with some boss, you can summon a friend in co-op to help you out, but I wouldn't recommend it since beating a boss alone and all by yourself feels infinitely more rewarding, at least to me.There are only 2 cons about Dark Souls 3 in my opinion.1. Keyboard and mouse controls are awful, I strongly recommend not using them to play this game, a controller is pretty much a must-have if you want to have a good time!2. Camera. In some boss fights like 1st phase Nameless King, when he's riding that dragon you're fighting the camera more than you're fighting the boss.These cons are easily forgivable since there are so many good things about Dark Souls 3, and everything else about the game is epic!I have so much more things to say about the game, but this review is already too long, so to summarize:1. Extremely challenging game.2. No tutorial or hand-holding, you're on your own from the start.3. Very simple and minimalistic UI.4. Godly boss and level design.5. Fun exploring.6. Interesting story.7. Environmental storytelling.8. Good replayability.9. Enjoyable gameplay.10. Big variety of weapons and armor.11. Good optimization.Even almost 7 years after its release, Dark Souls 3 is still worth buying for the full price of 60 euros.The best singleplayer game I've played. 10/10",1

Positive,"Dark Souls 3 is a fantastic addition to the series that improves upon the previous formula very well. If you were to compare this to Dark Souls 1, it has better bosses, the same (epic) quality of music, incredibly fun weapons, and cool looking armor. The only thing I would say DS1 has over DS3 is a better world. If you're new to the series, DS3 is a fine place to start. It references the past 3 games but given that all of these games have implicit story, you're not going to feel lost or anything; you may just not recognize certain references/items from old games. As this is a souls game, it is of course very difficult. There are a few areas that admittedly feel a bit unfair, but most of the game's difficulty is a proper challenge where you know where you went wrong.

After revisiting this game having played Elden Ring (which I love), I was amazed to find how much of the latter's gameplay refinements have come directly from this game. If you like Elden Ring and are waiting for the DLC, do yourself a favor and play/replay this. If you have never played a FromSoft game, this is probably a very good introduction, although the story may be a bit obscure for new comers. The only downsides are some buggy achievements unlocking (never had this issue with other FromSoft titles) and the grinding required for some Covenant rewards, if you wish to play this offline.",1
Positive,Great game best game ive ever played. like ever. No fucking joke like i love getting fucking fisted by bosses that i should be killing first try. like fucking wolnonk or whatever cause dont you just love getting forced to the top of the boss arena then he spits his fucking gunky juice shit all over the area its amazing. It was this point in the game i realised that i didnt care if i beat him because i was summoned into my friends world and it meant more to him than me so instead i just caved my skull in and threw my pc out my window and finally i was in peace. like i could just die in peace go to heaven but realise heaven doesnt exist so i went back to the wolnir boss arena and i will forever get fisted by his gassy juice getting poured into my blood stream and poured into my fucking arsehole. at this point i realised i only had to break his stupid gucci bracelets made by fucking lil pump i then easily killed him and killed myself. best game 10/10 i just wish i could fight High lord wolnir for the rest of my puny existance on this god forsaken planet(I have like 600 hours on dark souls 3 and like 500 on dark souls 1 on console so this review is the most valid thing you will ever read about a game ever),1

Positive,"do not need to be discussed again, you must be ready to die quickly at the beginning of the game and even die many times. Don't be frustrated, just enjoy it (even though it's always emotional every time you play at the beginning and sometimes almost throwing the controller at the monitor), the point is always being patient in playing is enough to give the impression to always be patient in every moment",1
Positive,"Video Version:Dark Souls 3 is an excellent if almost somewhat nostalgic ending to the Souls series of games. My experience with it was a nearly perfect one from the perspective of performance and stability. I had no crashes and maintained a solid 60 frames per second throughout essentially the whole game. Controller support is functional right out of the box without needing to go to Durante for a fix and you just need something like DS4Windows to use a Dual Shock 4 controller.The weapon, monster and boss variety is great but the zone visual variety is a bit lacking when compared to the other souls games. Most zones are tied together nicely and the ones that aren t can be easily teleported to with short load times, at least on the PC version which is what I played.All in all, this is a game that is absolutely worth playing. It s worth buying at full price and is a must have in the game library if you enjoy 3rd person action games. It s also pretty damn good for working on your hand eye coordination. And with any luck, From Software will give us some great DLC content in between now and whatever their next dystopian psychologically horrific game happens to be.",1

Positive,"This is some of the most fun I ve had playing a video game. Dark Souls 3 is my favourite in the series. It feels like they took what they learned from all the previous games and made this game the most refined experience out of them all. It feels streamlined but in a good way, it s missing the interconnected feeling from Dark Souls 1 where every area connects with each other which I kind of miss but on the other hand I wasn t getting stuck as to where I needed to go next every few hours like I did in Dark Souls 1. In Dark Souls 3 you always know your path ahead and it s a good feeling and you can feel the the progression you are making which is nice. It s the most atmospheric souls game too, it does a great job immersing you in its amazingly crafted environments. The level design is terrific, a lot of awesome and memorable areas and much less frustrating and annoying ones like the crystal cave in Dark Souls 1 or the shrine of amana in Dark Souls 2, there is nothing close on that level of annoyance in Dark Souls 3. The combat and movement is the best it s ever been, I like how its more fast paced which you can tell they ve taken from Bloodborne and it s a welcome addition. It was by far the easiest game in the series but I think that s mainly because I have a lot of experience from the franchise rather than the game itself being easy because I can see some areas and boss fights being really difficult for newcomers in particular. I think this game is a masterpiece in design and execution. 10/10 (Masterpiece)",1
Positive,"Compared to the first Dark Souls game, DS3 is ""young and good-looking"" with a slightly shallow background story, so well-prepared veterans may find this sequel more like an adventure game instead of a souls game. But any wording saying this game is not a masterpiece is a lie. Dark Souls III is hard than Dark Souls II, but much easier than the original Dark Souls game. Unlike the original game's connecting-as-a-whole map, some of DS3's maps are separated and only teleport can access, with Firelink shrine being the most typic one. That's a disappointment, since the surprise of opening a door to find a super shortcut is gone. However, I believe that the Dev. put all their efforts in designing bosses and builidngs. Irithyll (still don't get its pronounciation) and Anor Londo are straightly perfect. Sometimes I even feel that the city has the ability to grab my soul, then throw it into an oil painting. Well when my friend was playing this game for the first time, on the stairs between Dancer and Vordt, I told him, ""Do you wanna feel Dark Souls ? Then turn left and kill the man sitting on a chair. You'll see."" No doubt he was ripped by Dancer, but he then knew what makes a pretty boss fight. Being the last game of the series, Dark Souls III answered lots of questions and also suggested us endings of some NPCs, no matter you are wondering or not. One is the laddersmith being dead in profond city, right next to the bonfire, who also appeared in Dark Souls II. This story tells us, 15,000 souls for a ladder is too much. Greed will cost your life. Also, is Gywnevere (or Gywndolin) related to Aldrich ? Is Andre related to Gywn ? The fire keeper, is she really blind (even after you gave her the eyes) ? Why is Patches ""Unbreakable"" ? I was super into lores of DS for a while and some of those questions really bothered me. There are Youtube channels making videos stating their own opinions. Check them ! The pros+Bosses are more agile and harder (My circus needs a dancer. Anybody ? )+ Lots of endings (Yes and for achievements you have to proceed to NG++)+ Best DLC of the series + Beautiful weapons and magics + Princesses are always gay (?)The cons- Battle mechanism stays the same, especially for mages. - Too many bonfires (lowers the difficulty)- Dislikable blue bar -Where's my Dark Souls III The Fire Fades Edition ?

Positive,"In 2011, my journey began. And in 2017, that journey ended. The original Dark Souls (2011) kindled a relationship with a video game that I had never experienced before. That relationship is stronger than ever, having morphed and strengthened over time across the series three iterations. The first game caught my attention, enthralling me in an imaginary universe I had never experienced before, but also tested my metal. The second game continued on the first game s strengths, but never captivated me like DS1. And now we have the third.In all honesty, I had my reservations about the latest, and final Souls game. Before the game s release I felt that From Software, the developer of the Soulbourne series, had exhausted their creativity and originality with the first and second games, and thus the third would end up a mere imitation of the series previous outings. But alas, my cynicism was proven wrong. Spoilers aside, this third outing in the series sees players take control of the Ashen One , a being tasked with bringing a bunch of Lords of Cinder to task, thus ending, or beginning anew, the age of fire a daunting task, as in DS1 & DS2, you yourself became a Lord of Cinder at each game s conclusion. The game functions and plays exactly as the previous two games. If the formula aint broke, then no point trying to fix it! Over +-35 hours you will explore a wide array of environments, defeat enemies, collect souls, consume said souls, and kit out your character with increasingly more powerful items, outfits and weapons, so that you can go and explore more dangerous locales, defeat even bigger enemies and consume more plentiful souls. This formula is repetitive, but maintains the player s attention through continuously presenting him/her with increasingly more challenging encounters that require skill, learning, knowledge and, for me at least, pure dumb luck.For some, the Souls games may prove difficult, but I believe the better term is challenging . Once you have learned the ins and outs of the game s combat and rpg mechanics you should be good to go. Of the three souls games DS3 does a good job of presenting the player with challenging encounters that never enter the realm of feeling impossible. The only boss that disproves this is Midir, an optional DLC encounter who functions much like other bosses, but has a ridiculous amount of health that can take what feels like eons to whittle down. Moreover, the challenges the bosses present are, arguably, made easier by offering the player options to summon npc characters to help fight most of the games many bosses. On the other hand, your journey is complicated by numerous invasions, whereby npc characters will invade your world and try their damndest to end your life. However, the AI of these invaders leaves a lot to be desired. Most can be easily defeated by stepping backwards after the invader attacks, then darting back in to deliver some damage; rinse and repeat and you ll destroy any invader. Overall, the choreographed invasions are pretty poor in comparison to what would occur in previous Souls games. Boss fights are the highlight of this game, and they rise to the high expectations set by both DS1 and DS2. DS3 provides a plethora of diverse bosses that range from humanoid warriors to hulking behemoth tree-giants. Each have their own style and atmosphere that never come too close to seeming akin to each other. A major boon for DS3 is that every boss has at least two different phases which force players to often alter their strategy mid-fight in order to compensate for a new phase of attacks or even environment. However, DS3 is quite conservative with regards to the kind of bosses it presents to the player. DS3 does not provide anything close to the alien and strange creatures that can be found in DS1 or Bloodborne; rather most bosses stick to having a humanoid form whilst wielding a large sword- or club-like weapon.To fight these big badass bosses, one needs good equipment. DS3 does a great job at providing a magnificent array of armor sets, weapons and spells. Importantly, the game plays on the nostalgia factor by providing items from past souls games. At one point I was able to kit out my character almost exactly as once done in DS1, as well as DS2. One complaint that I do have with regards to weapons is that the game has a tendency to force the straight and great sword options on the player due to them being so common, prevalent and effective. Both DLCs added much variety to the weapons arsenal, as well as special attacks that can be quite mesmerizing on first sight. Moreover, if arcane warfare is your thing, then DS3 has it covered. Faith, pyromancy and mage builds are supported by a multitude of spells for each school of magic, and are devastating in both PvE and PvP. An integral component of the Souls games is exploration. The DS3 adventure occurs across many well designed environments, each having their very own particular atmosphere and context-specific encounters. From dark dungeons to sky-high castles, putrefying swamps to forgotten caverns, the games does a great job at proving a wide array of areas to explore. Apart from the challenging enemy encounters, the player will interact with several npc characters, some of which will help you out, while others will attempt to hinder your progress. These npc s are far more expressive than those in previous Souls iterations, with many doing more than just standing around looking glum as in past Souls games. Some of these encounters reveal lengthy questlines, that once completed, have major influence on the overall main story line as well as on a variety of events. This is a welcome advent to the Souls series.Leading from this, we have the lore of the game. Like previous Souls games, little of the game s overarching narrative is told through direct story telling methods. Rather, the bulk of interesting and enigmatic lore and story comes from item descriptions and thorough inspection and observations within the game world. By just paying extra attention to one s surroundings, major plot points and supporting content can be uncovered. For those gamers that prefer story flung into their faces through lengthy cut scenes and detailed in-game codex s, be aware! DS3, as well as all other Souls games, takes a more active rather than passive approach to storytelling.With regards to presentation, DS3 is a beautiful game that successfully brings life to a dark fantasy world. Characters models are well designed and textures are good enough to seem realistic. However, some areas lack the intricate details afforded to others, making for an uneven experience from region to region. Adding to the aesthetic of the game, is the music and sound. DS3 sticks much to what has been done in past Souls games. Adventuring across the game s world is mostly done in absence of any music score. This and the environmental noise and sound do well to capture the feelings of isolation, loss and entropy. Once a major encounter begins then only does the typical Souls score commence.Overall, Dark Souls 3 is a fantastic entry and end to the Souls series. It may not experiment or adjust the Souls formula as much as some may have hoped for, but it does present a daunting adventure that will challenge anyone willing to take the chance. Personally, I find Dark Souls 3 to be a great Souls game; not quite as good as its older brother Dark Souls 1, or even its demented cousin Bloodborne. But it is a damn fine game in its own right.Score: 9/10",1

Positive,"I was initially skeptical as Dark Souls III seemed too easy and linear compared to the first and the second part. Also, I was not too fond of the fact that there's now a lot more fast-paced action instead of slower, methodical, and more tactical combat. Fortunately, I quickly got humbled by my cocky attitude and I found the challenge I was looking for.The game is slightly different from its previous parts, just like DS2 was different from DS1. It's indeed faster and more linear, maybe even more casual, but it doesn't affect the fun that DS3 generously provides. There are quite a few challenging and memorable bosses, the same goes for the areas you visit. I'm not the best at From Software's side quests and I think I haven't finished a single one in this part, but they're definitely there as well.While this is probably my least favorite Souls title from the original trilogy, it's still one of the best games I have ever played.",1
Positive,"Awesome game, probably the best out of the Souls series but. I wouldn't recommend it. Atleast not right now. For you see, the devs went overzealous with their anti-cheat system, so much that it bans legit players for no reason. Of course some might think that it is a small price to pay for getting rid of cheaters and hackers, right?WRONG!This does nothing. In fact players have been using hacked weapons to softban legitimate players by giving them more souls than they should have, thus the anti-cheat system labeling them as cheating. All it took was a few slashes and poof, you're banned. Hard to believe, right? Well, go ahead and google it and see for yourself. The one responsible even streamed the whole thing for a couple of hours, soft banning lots of innocent players. Also, lets not mention the other dozen of possible reasons why you might get banned, such as: crashing due to the game's lightning effect bug, going offline advancing in the story and coming back online only for the game to think that you cheated and got more soules than you had before going offline, using a controller program so you can use your favorite controller, just to name a few from the stop of my head.So yes, as awesome as the game is. don't buy it. Not yet, not until the devs fix the shitty anti-cheat system they made and start unbanning all the legitimate players.EDITED: 5/8/2016I felt like I should correct one of my mistakes, in my anger I failed to explain properly that getting softbanned by a hacker isn't instant and for that I apologies for the misinformation. When you get hit by the hacked weapon you can get rid of the surplus souls by suiciding twice which seems to work and might give some measure of relief for those that might fall victim to such people.Even so I can't and won't recommend the game, not until they fix this.EDITED: 30/9/2016Right, now that they solved some of the issues and unbanned players that didn't deserve it I can actually recommend the game.",1
Positive,"If u had played previous dark souls ( especially 1/remastered) : Get the game. It serves as a proper closure to the series and still delivers what makes this series so great . Just go and get it , you will love it . If u haven't play any soulsborne game : Highly recommend you to play Dark souls 1 / Remastered first , if else you will miss certain references and callbacks to previous lore and locations. I know dark souls games have a bad rep for being overly difficult . That was the factor that turned me away from this series . However when i gave it a try , I think the difficulty is perfectly fine. The game is challenging , without a doubt , but it is designed as such to create a sense of tension. It is similar to how combats in real life usually turns out : a bad decision in a split second / hesitate and distracted in combat would cause death. ( That being said , the game gives you 2 or 3 chances to act for your survival , ""One Hit Kill"" usually does not happen. )The adrenaline rush and the amount of sheer FOCUS you experience throughout the boss fights is one of the two best things this game offers. This game heavily relies of quick decision making and reflex, If you spend too much time lost in the thoughts of your tactics or worrying about the consequences of losing the duel , you already lost the fight. The second best thing this game offers is the sense of accomplishment that none other game could provide. That is the main appeal of SoulsBorne game , in my opinion. Never had I jumped out of my chair yelling "" I WON "" and hyperventilate due to adrenaline even the battle has already settled for 15 minutes , Not until I played this Dark Souls 1 and this game , Dark Souls 3 .tl;dr : If you like fighting big dudes and overcoming all odds to achieve victory If you like the thrill of combat where your actions could result in a victory or defeat in the matter of seconds If you like epic orchestral music and chants cheering you on when you face off against your enemies Buy This Game .",1

Positive,"Coming back to Dark Souls 3 after hundreds of hours in Elden Ring has been quite an experience. Originally I played about 65 hours worth of Dark Souls 3 before I dropped it for other things. It was my introduction into the Souls-like genre and it left a decent impression on me, but for one reason or another, I never gave it a second thought. 5 playthroughs of Elden Ring and at least 2 playthroughs of the Shadow of the Erdtree DLC later left me craving something similar, thus we return.Dark Souls 3 represents a key point of growth in the FromSoft catalog, in which we see a much more refined product than its 2 predecessors. That said, it suffers from caveats that FromSoft polished even further for the release of Elden Ring, but I don't believe this lack of polish is a bad thing. If anything it offers a different challenge from Elden Ring. I believe Dark Souls 3 deserves to be played and judged on its own merits because it has been a good experience thus far. 4/5 starsMay the Flames guide thee, Ashen One.",1
Positive,"at first i thought it was just some hard game set in a boring world, even the graphics didn't seem so appealing back then and i really started to feel regret buying itBut i decided i should give it a fair shot & after playing it for a little bit longer and right after i passed the first few little areas i started to feel some weird attraction to the game in a magical way, and the way i looked at it started changing for the better it was almost like ascending a staircase, a bit hard but really satisfying with every stepthe gameplay feels so smooth & variated, thanks to the ability to use magic & the wide variety of weapons selection making it even more fun and engagingand i also love the way items and secrets are scattered around the map, since it makes you so eager to explore every little corner of the map looking for them, especially since it's filled with all sorts of cool stuff & secrets and even some cool hidden bosses making it impossible for you to ever get bored with the gameand i must say bosses really impressed me here, they are so well crafted and programed, and even though they're so hard to beat, fighting them (and beating them) is fun as hell & really rewarding and satisfyingand what seemes like poor graphics at first turned into some breathtaking scenery later in the game, almost as if they are not from the same game you was playing at the beginning, trully remarcable!also the story & the lore are so interesting, and you also get 4 different endings for iti finished this game 5 times already and it was fun & enjoyable every signle one of them, almost as if i'm playing it for the first time, and i'm still looking forward to play it and finish it even more timesi don't think i'll ever get bored of it because for me at least this game has became the best game i have ever had the pleasure to try in my life 9,8/10",1

Positive,"Dark Soul 1 was gifted by a friend and when we start playing that I already enjoyed it so much, sadly the multiplayer summon option wasnt working that well back than.Ive never seen Dark Souls 2 so far, but probably will soon, and, went on with Dark Souls 3, the game is pretty, a lot of fun and the multiplayer is working better as ever! Good job on that one, the MP is so much more enjoyable.The only thing I do not really like is the level capping since the game has a build in difficulty system for when you go NG+ or higher so it would be pretty do-able to change difficulties when summoning verry high leveled players, but this could be an endless discussion caus there are always down and up sides.I also saw some environments and models back from DS1, which was a nice feeling back to thoose days but I did expect more new models/bosses to be around but I aint complaining at all.The game doesnt feel that long either but this can be on the fact that I summon a lot of friends, progress goes way faster that way.Currently I am in NG+ almost at the end and I will replay it again on NG++, that should say enough on how much I like this game :-)I do recommend it for others to buy aswell and enjoy this game!Be aware if you loose a couple times from a boss, it can become annoying or irritating, taking a break is that best thing I could recommend and try again another time. Eventually you will beat him!Also playing with friends makes the game way more fun and interesting compared as playing alone.Thats all, thanks!",1

Positive,"Finally, after 110 hours, I have completed my first souls game, taking all the time in the world to truly immerse myself in the world of Dark Souls. This game has done something for me that barely any other game has been capable of doing: making me feel genuinely powerful emotions. This is a game about life and death. If you, like me back in April 2016 on my Xbox, had never played a Souls game before, you'll learn very quickly that death is a frequent occurance. But this game is still fair . Something that Hidetaka Miyazaki (genius who was the director of DS1 and DS3) said in an interview that has stuck with me is that he doesn't see the game as difficult, but moreso challenging. This way of thinking really changed the way I see games no, and now it's hard for me to go back to other games because of the challenge and sense of accomplishment gained from overcoming a challenge in this game. And that's where the the emotions come into the picture. The intense feelings that I have gotten while fighting (Boss spoilers) the Nameless King is something I haven't felt in a boss fight or a fight in any game really. I died so repeatedly while fighting this boss and when I finally slew the bane of mine and many other player's existances [spoilers] (completely optional boss too) [/spoiler] I realized that my hands were shaking, my breaths were fast and shallow, and I was sweating. That 7+ minutes fight made me truly appreciate how amazing this game is. Around this point, which is very late game, is when I really got into the lore of the game, buying Dark Souls 2: SOTFS, and I'm going to pick up the remaster of the original for more stability than the original. This game got me into now one of my favourite series in gaming, as I'm a sucker for good stories and depp lore, this game's world really enthralled me. All in all, this has been such an incredible journey for me, about 2 years down the line, from console to PC to a new Chosen Ash. This game will always have a special place in my heart, and I hope it can do the same for you. This game is so deep and complex it can make some of the most incredible things happen, things that you will remember for years. The way the combat is weighty and slow but still fast-paced and exhilarating is the perfect way to make thrilling gameplay that always has you on the edge of your seat, deciding whether to press on and risk death or to head back to the bonfire to spend your hard-earned souls. This game is phenomenal, and something that I believe is a masterpiece of indirect storytelling, RPG mechanics akin to D&D, and gameplay that makes you feel like you truly accomplished something meaningful. I would recommend this game and the DLC (get them together though, they work so much better together than separate) any day, at full price. This game is amazing.",1

I don't think anything could really measure up to how beautiful this game looks. The gameplay, specifically the combat is genius. it just feels right. Every animation is fluid in 60 fps. Trust me, there isn't much to compare to the feeling of beating this game. IMHO this is one of the greatest games ever made.",1
Positive,I don't even know where to begin with this game. Its AMAZING. Everything is so polished and seamless. I've played this games 6 times over by myself and with friends. It has Skyrim replayability and the online works really well. I cant even explain how much I love it. 10000000000000/10,1

Positive,"nearly as good as dark souls 1 and absolutely the best bosses in the souls series and its not even close, sully and dancer are immaculate, abyss watchers are an absolute blast, irythill is the most gorgeous zone from has ever made and the gameplay is snappy and flashy. got banned because I used a boss rush mod but it was totally worth it",1
Positive,Is this game worth it? yes! Is this game worth it without multiplayer enabled? Some say yes some say no. I would say it is but I highly enjoy multiplayer and the fact that the servers have been offline for what 5 months now? for an RCE exploit that a modder fixed within a couple days and servers are still not back is inexcusable at this point and I feel obligated to give them a negative review. Bring back all the souls games Jolly Cooperation the fix is out just implement it already.Edit*** still not happy with how long it took to restore online services but they have been restored so back to thumbs up,1
Positive,"I don't usually write reviews because most people couldn't even bother to read them. Despite this, I would say that this is an amazing game that is surprisingly dead for how good it is. The soundtrack is beautiful, each enemy has its own moveset, strengths, and weaknesses. Bosses are even harder versions of the enemies but don't let the bosses fool you, the normal enemies are just as tough. I've died more to enemies before the boss than the bosses themselves. I've beaten this game about 20 times now with a new build each time. That should give you some insight on the replayability. When it comes to mulitplayer it boils down to two things, you either get ganked the moment you spawn in by three players, or you ""git gud"" and kill them. Usually you don't get a straight up 1v1 fight, when you do it is glorious, but most of the time you are getting ganked. The reason behind this is the game has a dedicated community, but isn't really growing. Dark Souls multiplayer is great, in my opinion, being able to fight alongside or against randoms is awesome but yet there is only around 7-10k people playing this game on the WEEKENDS. This is a game that came out 2 years ago? So often during invasions you will have to wait 5-10 mins for a fight only to get ganked. Its a vicious cycle. Graphically its beautiful, simple, not top of the line graphics but good enough to make you appreciate it. The weapons and armor designs are beautiful and mostly practical with a few whacky armor and weapons for those who like ridiculous proportions. Lookin at you STR builds >_> All and all, buy, play, git gud. Dark Souls is intimidating for some but trust me, by your 2nd-3rd playthrough you will be beating the bosses in your sleep. 10/10 game.",1
Positive,"(English)Well, I can only say this game it's a masterpiece, the bad thing about DS3, poise it's a pointless thing (weapons with perseverance for a tank it's more useful than a armor itself) and many areas of the game are locked so you have a linear progression ""sort of"" DS1 & DS2 you can take some different paths to progress.The PVE of this game it's the best, IA/hitbox are really well made, although it's more fast paced.The PVP well the PVP can be ""JOLLY GOOD"" or can be a ""Pa!n in hole"", I myself feel disgust to gank ""squats"" specially it's very common to the host quit with ""alt+f4"" when they die, still when u put your summon in Pontiff Sullyvah Arena, i met some really nice bunch of gladiators, so rejoice! Obs: i don't blame host when it's a invasion with invader/s who run around mobs instead of fight (this too it's shameful).Music of the game are amazing! I really love Soul of Cinder/Introduction theme /Vordt/Abyss Watchers songs it's superb!Weapons/spell balance, arguibly u can beat the game at SL1 using a broadsword without tempering it.Still after you try some weapons out most of the mainstream/good weapons. Have a similar pattern of attack and this can become a monotonous thing, one good way to avoid this it's making a Mundane build or creating another character(playing another game too). Nevertheless the're some useless thing in the game and you only need to search for them to get achievements.Worth it? Definetely yes.

Positive,Best in the Souls series.,1
Positive,"I just played this game because of research purpose, I never play any souls-like genre anymore after PS2-era but I have experience in some hardcore action games and I think I'll like and able to beat this game.But, after playing for 3-4 days, I found that I am not the ""target player"" because it makes me so tired. I like to do an exploration in many games, but here, it is very punishing, even more than the boss fights, especially when you dropped much souls in the middle of your journey.I tried playing it again until I managed to kill several bosses, because I still like the storyline, and ""research purpose"" of course. Then, the more I tried it, the more curious I became, I also thought that I had learned about how to beat this game and it turned out to be fun for me, like a rhythm games that I really love. I got the intention of this game that sometimes you have to lose because you need to know the enemy patterns more, while you still feel the enemy is beatable if you try more.What I also like here is there are lots of interesting hidden things, when you find them you will be even more interested. The lore itself is told indirectly which is cool for me. The consequences of your actions are also something I've never encountered in other games, like you can lose NPCs and their features for the entire session if you like, to kill them for example, or not do something before.I want to play previous Dark Souls series to know the whole story but I'm afraid that I won't be able to enjoy the controls, based on my friend's story and it's a very old game. Maybe I'll try Elden Ring next (which I think is also good for my next research), whose controls (or perhaps difficulty level) have been ""made easier"" from this DS3 and also makes me more confident that I can beat it easily compared to DS3. XD",1
Positive,"From what I've played so far (3 hours in), this game is looking to be pretty amazing. It's Dark Souls, for sure. It seems to take the best of each game and then combine them into one super-game. I love it, personally.

Great game with a lot of variety. Must have for tryhards!I would Praise the Sun till the fire fades ! 10/10,1
Positive,"Personally, Dark Souls 3 has the best story and second best level design in the series after the original one. The game really doubles down on weapon and armor variety that leaves you satisfied. Anyone can find a playstyle that suits them better. Compact level design pushes players into various events in each area that needs you to carefully dissect otherwise seemingly impossible challenges. Gameplay revolves around more dodging and favors offensive playstyle as enemies are much more aggressive and fast compared to previous titles. The base game is well crafted and executed but I can't say the same for the DLCs. DLCs feel like they don't want you to engage in the combat and just run through everything. The game encourages you to react strategically and use your brain but DLC pushes you so much that after dying in some areas, you don't want to kill those 40 enemies that take 15 mins to go through again. They clearly went overboard here. It was fun for me to kill em all in the first run and then I sprinted past them. So be wary about this.But the good part about the DLC is that the bosses are particularly well done and does the game favor greatly. Extremely hard bosses that requires strict management and knowledge of the game's mechanics that makes you fully use everything to get past. Almost every major encounter in the DLCs are memorable, so at the end, downsides are forgivable.Possibly the best pvp mechanics of the series here. Multiple factions attacking and defending each other, it's total chaos that always ends up as an exhilarating experience through and through. Absolutely brilliant soundtrack as icing on the cake. Definitely recommended and a must play of the souls genre.",1
Positive,"DS3 is definitely the toughest among the 3 in the series. Devs took the best parts from DS1 and DS2 and merged them in DS3. The normal enemies are quite tough but on the contrary most bosses are easy. A lot of things from DS1 are mentioned here and that makes the journey quite reminiscing. This makes DS3 a true successor of Dark Souls 1. The created world is beautiful and at the same time full of evil.Loved both the DLCs. The transition of difficulty from the base game to the DLCs are very much noticeable. Ringed City is the hardest as well as the most entertaining part in the entire game. Kept getting squashed by Midir and Gael again and again until cooking up some strategies and having some luck.The graphics, tone of the world, and music are top class. Also the occasional ambushes are enjoyable. Loved every moment of this game as I completed it thrice :)",1
Positive,"Live. Die. Repeat. Curse some, but never stop playing.I finished this game on PS4 and I got it as a gift (fitting, I must say) on steam. Superb gameplay, which borrows some of its characteristics from Bloodborne.However, be mindful of its multiplayer. After Elden Ring launched earlier this year, the servers suffered. Also, steam removed multiplayer as its characteristics, and online play is not available, which is a bummer, while also being very important in a souls game.With that setback in mind, I must say that Dark Souls III is a superb game. But if you want to play multiplayer, maybe now is not the time for that.",1

Positive,"I get it now.I see why people love this series. Life is a journey, not a destination.",1
Positive,One of the greatest games i ever played. It is the best Dark Souls game ever. A really good finale to the series. It's got some of the most immersive and graphically impressive enviroments. The art design and sound are top notch. Enemy & the bosses variety is well done. Masterpiece,1
Positive,"I didn t finish Dark Souls 2 because of the weird controls and no support for controller remapping (a big deal for me). So, I jumped straight from Dark Souls 1 to 3, and found Dark Souls 3 to be a major step up from an already solid game.The level design in Dark Souls 3 is much more refined compared to Dark Souls 1, where some areas felt utterly unfair. While the map is more linear in Dark Souls 3, it still offers great interconnectivity without being overly complicated. This makes exploration and navigation a lot more enjoyable. More importantly, though the map is not as sophisticated as Dark Souls 1, it gives players a clearer idea of where to start, helping them avoid accidentally stumbling into high-difficulty areas. Plus, the boss arenas are closer to bonfires, so no more long, annoying runs back after dying.I wasn t a fan of the final boss in the first DLC - I found the second phase unnecessary and a bit messy. However, Dark Souls 3 features very solid boss design, even surpassing Elden Ring in overall quality. While Dark Souls 1 undeniably has the best opening of any From Software game, I really enjoy the lore in Dark Souls 3, which expands the world and has tons of callbacks to the first game. These references either continue or conclude some of the original lore, making it my favorite part of the game.In my opinion, Dark Souls 3 is nearly perfect, but the ridiculous enemy spam in the DLCs can ruin the experience. In DLC 1, it feels like the developer forgot about balance and just crammed enemies into every corner. DLC 2 is slightly better, but the enemy encounters from the Ringed Inner Wall to the next bonfire are frustrating and over the top. The camera tracking can also get messy and disorienting at times, and the short lock-on range can often disappear mid-fight, leading to serious frustration.And why the hell doesn t this game have cloud save?Despite those issues, Dark Souls 3 is a must-play for anyone interested in the genre, blending challenging yet fair gameplay, refined level and map design, and captivating lore. It is the textbook example of a souls-like game, where the core features of the genre come into their own.",1
Positive,"Allright, this game is great. The world might not be as good and interconnected as DS1, but that's one of the only gripes I have about this game.The combat is way better with more options, more tension, and way better balanced than the older games. It just works more as intended which feels amazing.The levels are really well designed with shortcuts and good enemy placementsThe areas look cool and have good enemy varietyThe bosses are amazing to fight with a few exceptions, like the wyvernsThe music is the best in the series, imoI will talk about the dlc on its own:Ashes of ariandel:I love this dlc, it might just be a single area, it is a damn good one. The enemies are cool, it tells a real story, it looks great.I love the end boss too, very cool fight even with how hard it is. Truely amazing dlc. Some people say it's too short, but I'd say it's worth it.Ringed City:I feel a bit more mixed about this dlc, While I really like the new enemies, the lore, the areas and the bosses, all amazingI had some problems with some of the enemy placements, where it felt like they just threw a whole bunch of strong/annoying enemies in one place, fuck you deal with it. This is the only problem I have with it however, so if you can deal with a tiny bit of that, this dlc is still amazing.",1
Positive,"I bought this game with all its DLCs for about 5 Dollar (approximately 3 years ago). It was a great misfortune for my first close combat game to start with the Dark Souls series because when I first started the game, I couldn't really muster the patience. One day, at the insistence of a friend, I tried installing the Cinders mod, which makes the game a bit easier, and I played the game for about 5 hours in one sitting. The game had started to addict me. I quickly finished the game with Cinders; I deleted the mod and started playing vanilla. The game had started to draw me in more; both in terms of story and gameplay. I finished the game once, it wasn't enough, I finished it a second time, it still wasn't enough, and so on. I finished the game with vanilla version 4 times playing with Cinders once, and it still wasn't enough. Right now, I'm playing the Convergence mod. This review will be for the Vanilla version.As you all know, the Dark Souls series is a straightforward melee combat game, in other words, a pure fighting game. What was present in the previous games holds true for Dark Souls 3 as well, but there are some changes in certain aspects. 1- The most noticeable point while playing is that the Estus drinking animation is shorter compared to Dark Souls 2, and we can move while doing it. 2- The roll mechanic works much smoother than Dark Souls 2, and the hitboxes are much more precise. 3- I don't know if I need to mention this, but the visual effects of the bosses are truly amazing. 4- The gameplay of bosses like Soul of Cinder, Pontiff Sulyvahn, Sister Friede, Abyss Watchers, and many others is truly beyond amazing and provides incredible satisfaction. 5- The feeling of landing hits is much better than Dark Souls 2. (You don't feel like you're hitting a boss with butter anymore.) 1- As everyone would agree, not being able to use some boss weapons or mimic their moves. 2- Farron Keep (I don't need to say anything else, those who have played it understand what I mean, and those who will play it will understand when they get here.) 3- Playing as a sorcerer in this game is a real struggle.The Dark Souls series focuses on three main themes:-What fire is, as in ""Dark Souls 1""-Hollows, as in ""Dark Souls 2""-The fading of fire, as in ""Dark Souls 3""This game revolves around the fading of fire, and it accomplishes this exceptionally well. It's a classic move by our brother Miyazaki; he tells stories in an understated manner. It's easy to do that, but it's hard to engage the audience and stoke their curiosity to this extent. Normally, I would never finish a story-driven game five times or even attempt a sixth, but this game arouses so much curiosity in you that you find yourself thinking, ""What if I play like this?/How fast can I finish it with this build?/I think I missed something, let me check again/The fight with this boss was so amazing."" Just like me, it captivates many of my friends, and if you've played and finished this game with enthusiasm, it captivated you too, my friend. There's no point in empty fanboying here; the game is genuinely great. Although some parts - especially the dogs - are extremely frustrating, the game somehow manages to keep you glued to the screen.On the other hand, the game is moddable. The mods created by modders allow you to experience this game. Now you might say, ""But you're basing this review on mods too."" I'm not talking about how great the mods are, otherwise I'd go and write this under the mods made by those modders. What I mean is that the depth and beauty of the themes, NPC designs, level designs, story, bosses, and many other possibilities provided by mods make them deeper and more beautifully themed.This review covers both modding and the general aspects of the game. I compared it to previous games in some aspects, and you can clearly see the huge improvements. The game's dark theme, its exceptional depiction of the final leg of the Dark Souls story adventure, unique boss battles, fantastic/smooth gameplay, the ability to instill such a deep sense of curiosity, and the extensive and beautiful modding possibilities. In my opinion, this game deserves a 9 out of 10. I strongly recommend it to those considering buying it. When you get the game, lean back and savor the spirit of challenge and the joy you'll feel when you finally defeat that boss despite the difficulties.Note: I wish they'd explain the controls of this game with keyboard icons rather than Xbox ones.",1
Positive,"So nice I bought it twice. Imported it for the Xbox One, played through it about four times. Beautiful game, shitty Xbox version due to the 900p 30fps frame drops (yes, really). Absolutely a gem of a game, right up there for GOTY for me with Persona 5. The soundtrack is probably my favorite, but the best Souls game is easily Dark Souls. However, DS3's port is so much better that i'd have to recommend it over 1 or 2. Pros- Top tier music, as always- Summoning is at it's best, it's not off and on like in other Souls games- The max HP reduction from DS2 is gone. That was and will always be a horrible idea. Dark Souls is about skill first, then trial and error. To punish a player for dying and trying to learn from mistakes was a fuck up on FromSoft team B's part. - The landscapes. Jesus. It's really so beautiful, especially at the throwback location (won't spoil it) after the chapel. Cons - Gimmicky boss fights. Not saying they all are, but Yhorm? Really? The deacons? Why even give them a boss health bar? Pointless fights, even if one was a reference to Demon's Souls. - Length. For the final game in the series, this game was not long enough. You could just tell they were going to release DLC, you could feel it after beating the game. Though the ending does tie everything up (kinda, not really) there's just not enough substance there for it to feel like a full game. - Continuity. Remember in DS1, how everything was connected? From firelink to anor londo, to practically anywhere, the game told you how you got there, and about 90% of the time, you could even see the places you were, or will be soon. It felt great, kind of reminded me of Ocarina of Time. This begs the question, why was DS1 the only game that had this? Dark Souls 2 was all kinds of fucked. They had a poison gas swamp below a volcanic dungeon, a castle that just leads into a dragon's den (how convinent), and the DLC doesn't explain how you get there. You kind of just warp. Plus the DLC is even cheaper than the base game. But that's irrelivant to the point. - Difficulty. Maybe it's playing and finishing all the Souls games, but this game was damn easy. No, not in the way Gwyn is supposed to be, I mean beating the abyss watchers on the second try, before any guides were even out for the game, in a blind run. Why is High Lord Wolnir, arguably one of the coolest fucking souls bosses ever, easier than the Capra Demon, a boss an hour into the first game? The ancient dragon, pre-patch, was one of the hardest Souls bosses in DS2. In this game, you kill a dragon with a plunge attack. A FUCKING PLUNGE ATTACK? The only bosses I raged on was nameless king, because the camera was glitching out, an issue quickly fixed by fromsoft. The final boss whooped my ass too for about a dozen deaths or so. I didn't really rage at that though persay, it was actually the classic DS great feeling of being killed, but learning something each time about the boss' move set. Overall, Dark Souls III is lacking in some aspects, but to me, it's almost as good as the first because of the music, art style, and hours of enjoyment and satisfaction it did give. If I had to make a list of best to worst, it would go like this; DS> BB > DS3> DS2> DemonsSouls > DS2SOFS",1
Positive,"Yeah yeah, best Cockfight simulator i've ever played.",1
Positive,"Best game in the Souls series in many ways. While the level design in 1 is superior, 3 comes close to that in quality. As for combat, FROM has learned and taken the more responsive combat from 2 and improved upon that, making this the best technical experience in the series. With months of support post-launch and a new DLC coming out next month, this is a finely tuned experience that is more than worthy of the Dark Souls franchise.",1
Positive,"One of the most accessible Dark Souls, runs well, looks great",1
Positive,"I'm having a blast with this game. Even though I'm a bit late for the party, there are still players who invade, duel, gank, coop. So much joy invading or being invaded and always getting stuck in all sorts of funny situations, getting ganked, betrayed by the other invader, every now and then encountering some toxic player which spices things up, making me crack my knuckles and say something along the lines of ""Oh yeah.? Just you wait, I'll show you, you little **** or owning 3 phantoms and the host 1 by 1. Getting revenge and giving them all the point down.",1
Positive,"Dark Souls 3 was the game I had been eager to play for a long time, even before I had a PC, and I was so glad to finally be able to play this masterpiece. The game boasts the best quality among the three, having the privilege of being the latest in the trilogy. The best part for me was undeniably the bosses, Dark souls 3 has the most enjoyable fights in the entire series. While I acknowledge that the game failed to surpass its predecessors in certain aspects, such as the masterfully crafted world design and atmospheric brilliance of Dark Souls 1 and the intricate lore of Dark Souls 2, I didn't mind the simplicity. Besides, the game has excellent level design. I just admire the game's aesthetics; the art direction just won me over, as expected from a FromSoftware game. Music in this game is simply iconic. The haunting melodies and intense orchestral pieces add depth to every encounter, making each moment very memorable. The DLCs just elevate the game's experience, which is a consistent trend throughout the entire series. And if you care, I want to say that I took (and finished) the 'Dark Swols' challenge, where you do push-ups when you die, and I am kind of proud of it. (lol) The game concluded the series in the best possible way, cementing Dark Souls as my favourite game trilogy of all time. Praise the Sun!",1
Positive,"This game is brilliant. It takes all the parts of the original, mixes it with some ideas from Dark souls 2, and then takes the mastery of combat and atmosphere from Bloodborne and creates a masterpiece. I of course think there are a few problems with the game, especially because it's AAA game, but it is as close to perfect as I expect from a videogame.It's my favorite game to date, and it really feels like it's an improvement from Dark souls 1, mostly because of the bigger budget, better tech and more development time.The game looks great, even though it has some freezes here and there, which doesn't surprise me since this is a namco game. They are not known for good PC ports sadly, but this one feels more solid, which probably is because of the backlash from ports they have made in the past.All the different builds and classes have been balanced out. Now you can choose between how many Ashen Estus flasks (They restore mana) and how many Estus Flasks you want. This means that magic is a lot more useful.Weapons also have weapon arts, that basicly use up mana to do cool things like buffing you, penetrating shields and more! Shortbows can now also be good for long ranged combat and have special weapon arts so you can quickly do damage from a far with the cost of losing mana.This means that all builds use mana, and I even, who focused on DEX and Vigor, ended up using some pyromancies to give my sword fire damage and make me more resistant to fire. At the same time pyromancies are now scaled so the most awesome pyromancies require you to level up in intelligence and faith. In the original game, pyromancy was great for every build, which I honestly found irritating, since it made it so everyone used pyromancy. Something that i found got a litte repetitive.You can also speed up spellcasting with rings and putting points into dexterity which is great for sorcerers!This is great in my opinion! I love the fact that an armor is usefull to begin with. Even though taking care of your character and making them as powerful as you can is a great part of the game, having a new armor set and being able to just use it the minute you get is great!The locations in Dark Souls 3 are very diverse, though sometimes it seems like they are just trying to play with your nostalgia. I won't mention the locations, since spoiling it removes the fun, but just be sure to know that if you have played the original dark souls, you will be happy to see all the old locations, but also feel a little irritated. Though overall the locations are great and there are of course hidden areas with bosses and loot!The bosses are great! Some of they require a lot of skill, some of them not so much. Though generally I found them to way better than dark souls 2's bosses. Though in my opinion dark souls 2 was shit. I would say that they are about as good as dark souls 1's. They better fight in the technical department, but they a little less memorable. Luckily the bosses are all new, and are not just new versions of old bosses. They are a fun, challenging and satisfying. There is one boss in the game that comes up in the middle of the campaign that i found to be way too hard. Probably the only boss i can't without help.The game has a few issues though. This is mostly because of the mutiplayer. Firstly there is a bug that makes it so players lack animations. This normally also means that if you are invading or co-oping with another player, all the enemies in their world have no animations and won't be able to hurt you.I have recently seen it way less, so maybe they have fixes it.Another problem is that apparently you can't play mutiplayer if you have a VAC ban. I am not entirely sure how it works, since i experienced no problems in that field. Though if you have a VAC ban i would recommend not buying the game at it's current state, unless you are fine with not being able to player mutiplayer.A thing that i found was done surprisingly well were the warping bonfires. Normally shortcuts make you use older bonfires since they are all of sudden close to areas and bosses and I found that there are a lot of shortcuts compared to the original. The shortcuts are less about making the traveling time between areas shorter though and more about making the individual areas feel connected. It did feel like some areas got less used, but honestly it was not a big problem for me, and it felt like it was a thing that the development team wanted to get right.There are a lot of things to go into, but generally this game rocks! It's not as hard as people say, it just requires a little patients and being open to failing. If you don't fail you will never succeed. It has some problems that I find to be really irritating, but most of them will probably be fixed in patches.Enjoy dying, I know i did, and have fun exploring the world of dark souls!",1
Positive,"This game is really fun but it's been months with the servers down which means all the multiplayer aspects of the game are simply gone, which is too bad because, by design, that's a significant part of the game. When servers are back up I'll give it a positive review.EDIT: The servers are back up after the better part of a year, but hey it's an amazing game and now with full functionality. I can fully recommend you get this game as long as you like a challenge.",1
Positive,Best game I ever owned for 3mins.,1
Positive,It's a nice game,1
Positive,"Since my pc sucks, this game is a nice alternative to Elden Ring.",1
Positive,"I have changed this review to a more serious one.Dark souls 3 overall in my eyes is one of the best games I have ever played.The game is extremely challenging, which is what I thrive; challenge.I will be doing a list of Pros and Cons to give you an indication on what the game is about and hopefully sway you to experience this brilliant game for yourself.Pros:- Depending on if you like a challenge, then you'll love this game.- The mechanics are much cleaner than Dark souls 1 and 2, although they could be improved.- You get what you pay for, there are mutliple endings to this game with a big story which takes a long time to complete if you're new to the game.- The game is gorgeous, there are many moments when you just run around to look at the scenery and the skylines this game offers.- The bosses themselves are unique, they're all diferent and have all unique in their own way varying in challenge.- If you are a collector, then this game is full of collectables for you to collect (Rings, Miracles, Pyromancies and Sorceries.)- The combat system is always tactical as there can be different ways you can take down enemies or even a boss, always stays fresh.- Great customisable characters, as you can choose the class you want to be but also what they look like which the Soulsbourne games do very well.- The DLC 1 and 2 are brilliant, although they are short, they're worth it. The pure challenge and skill you need to beat the DLC is incredible and it will not be an easy challenge.- Offers you a lot of variation with the classes you can do as you can go for a Magic or a Combat character.- The speedrunning community are lovely, if you ever wanted to go into this category.Cons:- With it being so challenging, it may be 'too much' as you could give up with the game entierly. (git gid)- The online play can be very annoying as if you don't have any friends who play this game it will be hard to fight off against multiple players online to beat them and get an offering.- If you're wanting to complete covenant by getting 30 offerings it can be a chore as I grinded for multiple hours to get the drops from specific enemies. (Unless you get them from online play.)- It can be very repetitive and boring if you keep doing the NG+ saves.Ultimately, I think this game is a 9/10 and is definitely worth buying (Even the DLC)",1
Positive,"Dark Souls 3Rating: 9/10Genre: RPG Third PersonThe Good:+ This is the best looking Dark Souls both from a technical and artistic perspective. Many areas have beautiful vistas allowing you to take in the entire world and see many locations you previously visited, making you feel like you are part of something larger. + The level design is some of the best I have seen in a Dark Souls game. Every area feels amazing to explore and unlocking new shortcuts always feels satisfying.+ Every area has a very distinct atmosphere and level design. You can go from navigating deadly swamps to tight filled corridors and it all feels natural. + Combat has been altered. Things feel a bit faster than other Dark Souls games. I also found rolling to be more effective at dodging attacks than previous titles. + Multiple way of developing your character. + Boss battles look amazing and require real strategy and skill to take down. The Average:+/- A minor gripe I have are bonfire placements are placed too close together. Bonfire s in Dark Souls has always been a sense of relief, a place to regroup and go out and face new dangers. In this game I felt like I was running into a bonfire much more often than usual. The Bad:- NPC quest lines play a more prominent role, yet many of them require very specific things to do, and if you advance far into the game without completing a previous requirement you end up missing out. Even after reading a walkthrough, I thought to myself How is anybody suppose to figure this out on their own? - Once again UI can be really improved upon. You would expect the third game would fix some of these issues. - No pause button Conclusion:Easily my favorite Dark Souls game. Overall level design and mechanics seem to be refined and improved upon in most ways. I am not sure if I m just getting better at these types of games or they are making things easier, either way Dark Soul games have become one of my favorite franchises.",1
Positive,"As far as gameplay goes, this is the perfected iteration of the Dark Souls formula. I still appreciate some things in Demon's Souls better (ambiance, Tower of Latria, straightforward design), some things in Dark Souls 1 better (the ""Open"" world or the world design in general is better over there). Dark Souls 3 takes the speed of combat from Bloodborne in a Dark Souls context with a huge variety of weapons and playstyles. It takes a bit from every other Souls game that came before it and combines it to make a great game. The DLC really elevates the game from being a good one to being a legendary one. I love this game and love the DLC. I could talk about this game endlessly. the Berserk references, the references to other old anime movies as well as medieval mythology and it's own flavor. A true sequel to Dark Souls 1, almost to a flaw. Not going to overextend much about this game because chances are you already know all of this and have come to this game after trying other From Software games. This is the most polished gameplay wise from the trilogy+Demon's, the general structure of the game makes it easy to replay and the DLC is simply great. Praise the Sun fellow Ashen ones!",1

Positive,"Welcome to Gank City. If you couldn't get good then we'll see ya with the Pontiffs rejects in the grimy toxic swamps. To all the SL120 sweaty lapps. Praise the sun!For real though the games Lor is very details and you could beat the game without even knowing the storyline. It's very passive and not thrown in your face. The bosses are hard the first gamethrough but after that you come back with vengeance! Where this game really shines is the PVP. There are only so many weapons, spells, armor, tactics, buffs, whatever in the game an no matter how many times I run into people with the same stuff, EVERYONE fights differently and it's like fighting them for the first time, every time. You think this game may be easy, just casually killing every enemy with ease with your 2,3 or 4 phantoms and then you see ""you've been invaded"" and you all run! lmao This game reminds you that there is someone here to make you restart. And nobody wants to restart.For all though: It is a MUST to have the mods Watchdog OR Pyroprotecc. This game has no anti cheat (except a ban wave every Tuesday) and it's stupid easy to cheat with cheat engine. People can come into your worlds with god mode or insta kill you or inject items into your inventory that can get you banned or whatever. Cheat engine should be standard when you buy this game. I can't go into Gank City for 30 minutes without running into a cheater. And to all you people who think you're a god at pvp, put away your glitches. It's not a win for you, and when I kill you without using any glitches you will get the dung pie thrown on you.",1

Positive,"The strongest entry to end phenomenal trilogy. This time with more power and more lore love. FromSoftware games never stops you loving them. Kindle your first bonfire and cary your journey to the end. Try to be that hero or die trying. Everything is so well put in this title it blows my mind. From walking courpses to the flying giant dragons. So many of well designed and scary crafted enemies. Always asking what you gonna see next. The bosses gives you tippy toe challenge where they push you to the limits. Once again some of the most amazing and breahtaking of them are made it here. Yet alone The Nameless King, Sister Friede, Gael and Darkeater Midir will stuck in you mind for a long time. If you want to beat them you gonna learn how to dance with them. Its like walking in dark fantasy dream land. From giant castles to the frozen lands of forgotten tales. One of the best parts is trying to figure it out the story itself. If you know what you killing it gives you more meaning and perspective to the whole world surrounding of dark souls. Thanks to developers who made this game more acceptable in every way. Trying to get help from other players never felt so easy. Everyone is so helpfull and great. This title showed me that Dark Souls community is the most humble of them. Seeing so many people gathering near bonfire with so many different sets of armour makes you smile. One complaint I had with this title that it was the most hardest for me cause of one soul reason. They nerfed Sourcerer class to the ground. I hope they fix this mistake in Elden ring. This is it the journey ended. . .or maybe not yet. We will meet in Elden Ring once more to test our limits.",1
Positive,"Dark Souls has come full circle. From the niche beginnings with Demons Souls all the way up to today s Dark Souls 3. What was once a game series reserved for the masochistic and patients players has grown to a brand that moves millions of games at the mere mention of its name. It has become mainstream. Is this bad? Maybe. Is this good? Maybe. Better production value and refinement are among the merits, but it is a Faustian embargo because the key element of a Souls game; its difficulty, is kind of lacking in Dark Souls 3.Booting DS3 sends you into familiar territory. A black screen, with the imposing letters once again awaits you as you slave for hours in character creation to avoid a complete farce. The introduction then sets the stage for this instalment s cryptic story. The world as we left it after Dark Souls 2 has burnt out to nearly nothing by ashes and the time has come to once again rekindle the first flame. However, it takes five carcasses these days to stoke the fires so you are called from beyond the grave with the express purpose of dragging four of the five deadbeats back to the fire and casting their dried husks into it to give people an extension on their drab and dreary world. It s more of the same, and the lore and traditionally hidden plot development is leaning heavily on the original Dark Souls for its appeal. Frankly, the amount of DS1 pandering is so extreme that it makes the two or three concrete references in DS2 look tame. After having thoroughly established that kingdoms rise and fall in the sequel, part three throws all that plot development out of the window and returns to the source to bring alienated fans back. If you, like me, actually liked The Matrix Reloaded then you ll understand why this is a bad thing. After establishing a rich world with details, mythology and lore they forgo most of it just to shoehorn some of the old stuff back in there. When you look past the story you ll still find an incredibly solid and refined action role playing game that doesn t compromise on a single thing. The starting area guides you past easy enemies, different terrain types, your first bonfire and an enemy only the truly gutsy can tackle at that point. It doesn t take long before you meet your first boss which will either kick the living daylights out of you or you ll triumphantly destroy it on your first pass. What follows is a short hike to a building on the cliff where you enter the hub of this game: Firelink Shrine. Here you ll be given your purpose, a number of helpful NPCs and not a single proper hint that the bonfire in the centre will teleport you into the main game. This first section is painstakingly crafted to teach you the fundamentals. Or not; if you re a Demons Souls veteran and have played all the other games you ll breeze through it like it was a different game. Unbeknownst to me, this had become the theme for my overall experience with DS3. After I went to the first area, a castle, I was greeted with hollows, knights, dogs and a dragon. However, none of them really presented an obstacle. Nor was the first boss, a quadrupedal knight with an ice club, much of a challenge if you re used to playing a dodge build. This continued throughout the game. Most bosses only took me one or two tries to beat. If I used summons I didn t even have to try. I hardly ever got killed. Sure I died a few times in the Dragon Keep, and Knightslayer Tsorig sure knows how to earn his name, but I never felt in any way triumphant or relieved to have passed an obstacle or have beaten a boss. Returning to the game with a different build did give me a challenge eventually, but when playing like I usually do the game was kind of a breeze. If death is your teacher in Dark Souls, then I didn t learn much this time round. For all them memes and jokes made about its difficulty, DS3 doesn t live up to its predecessors reputation.DS3 may have lost a notch in difficulty, but it certainly has gained props in its level of quality. DS 2 was mired at first for its lack of polish. Sloppy hitboxes, poor level design, bland graphics and enemy design. DS3 has got none of that; it is an amazing accomplishment in level of refinement, presentation and interface design. Hitboxes are now perfectly implemented. You can vault through two swooping swords and land on the other side unscathed. Firebreath stops exactly where it seems to stop and a giant s foot only stomps where it lands. This is a colossal improvement over 2 s dingy detection. The improvements don t end there. The game is gorgeous. Skyboxes create an amazing sense of scale while the miniscule details in the world make each area vibrant and alive (despite the fact that everything is dead). Capes and cloaks look absolutely gorgeous and you have all the options to make your character look truly stunning. The game runs excellently at 60fps at 1080p on a GTX970. FROM also made a considerable effort to make the regular enemies a lot more interesting. From your regular zombies to ravenous beasts, there are some incredibly creative designs. Some enemies are as challenging as bosses themselves, without being cheap like in DS2. Speaking of bosses, despite some of them being stupidly easy, a good number of them are still amazing. I d have to say that they re more cool than hard, but the hardest bosses in the game also happen to be the coolest. Imagine a pope with lightsabres, or an insanely intense fight against a dragon rider knight, without any gimmicks. These are the game s highlights and the moments where I enjoyed the game most. Not everything is perfect though. While a lot of systems have seen significant polish, quite a few enhancements that were introduced in DS2 were dropped along with its lore. The power stance in gone, replaced with special dual weapons; reducing the creative weapon matching to almost zero. Poise is gone; the game did away with it entirely; enemies still hit you through walls; new game+ is severely lacking in features; NPC quests are more vague than ever before and often end without warning. None of these issues are game breaking. The overall whole is extremely solid and amazingly well engineered. It is just so perplexing that many of the systemic improvements from DS2 were removed. I guess streamlining is the keyword here, but that still doesn t make up for the inability to wield two repeater crossbows. Another massive gripe stems from PVP. The implementation of a password system to hook up with your friends is also extremely welcomes (seriously, this password system is the best thing since the white soapstone). However, the tweaks to PVP matchmaking are horrible. The game now biases invasions to intrude the world of a host with a phantom. That way, the invader has to face at least two, more powerful opponents, with a possible blue spirit joining the host to fend off the invader. Meanwhile, invaders can kill each other, despite pursuing the same goal. PVP is reserved to the truly committed invaders with the skill and ability to pull off these feats. After thirty hours the credits roll on what was to me the easiest Souls experience I had had up to that point. It was by no means a bad journey. It looks and runs amazingly, the combat is still fun and the online component runs like clockwork most of the time. It is refined to the point of perfection, but certain elements are up for debate in both terms of gameplay and plot. Without a doubt the best Dark Souls experience available on PC.This review was edited to fit the character count. Certain illustrations and elaborations were omitted. Feel free to ask questions.",1

Positive,"Wow, What can't I say good about the game that has me hooked like wildfire. This was my first real playthrough of a souls game, of course after I played it I went out and beat the other 2, just to say I did and also because I fell in love with the Rich Lore of this game. Every item you pick up in the game has a description and most of them can be traced to something in the previous games. You can find subtle hints of things you've seen before in the game and hints about bosses and the purpose of the placements of items. And the gameplay in this one is far more polished than the previous two, (save for the low stamina costs, but to be honest with the way these bosses work, you need to dodge a ton.)From the Very beginning of the game they pit you against a tough boss if your new to the souls series, but don't let anything intimidate you in this game. Take the world of Lordran/Lothric by storm, head in without fear of dying because you probuly will die and there is nothing you can do about it. Just learn from every encounter and be sure to recover your souls. Your in for a wild ride, not for the faint of heart or for those weak in courage. The game has plenty to offer in terms of multiplayer as well. You can team up with 3 other friends to take on the challenges of the game which can be some of the most fun in the game, but beware you are also suseptable to being invaded by another player who wants to take your ass for a ride and then kill you. Then again you could turn to the same method and go invading yourself. The game also has a dueling community, aka a group of players who participate in friendly duels with one another. The latest DLC for the game has streamlined the whole dueling process by adding matchmaking to dueling. You can also do 2v2, 3v3, 4 and 6 man free for alls and more.Final Verdict: Dark Souls 3 is a challenging experience, with a ton of replay Value. The game will grow on you if you let yourself get hooked. Also a great game to play with some friends! BIG NOTICE: CONTROLLER HIGHLY RECCOMENDED.This Game is near impossible to play with Keybindings. Get a damn controller if you wanna play.",1

Positive,"This game is one of the best games i've ever played. It has one of the best lores, extremely challenging, The experience becomes better if you talk about the story with your friends and have the volume on while playing :) and much much more <3 In my personal experience 70% percent of the people playing this game are using 3rd party program or cheat engine or at least around that percentage. Thats really unfortunate, So what i highly recommend you to do before activating "" Play online "" or going online in this game is > Back up your ds1, ds2 and ds3 file. How do you do that? Go to > This computer or This PC > Users > your computers name > App Data > Roaming and click on ds3 or any of the ds games. So now you've got a folder thats "" Users ID "" that folder has a file, That file is your in game progressing save. Please back up that file by manually copy and pasting it from time to time or even better everytime you close the game. Paste it into your other Hard Drive ( HHD) or anywhere you feel like it'll be safe in :)Why do you wanna do all of that? Is firstly because Steam Cloud doesn't support this or any ds games :) So it's not like Csgo, dota2 or many other games that save automatically in your steam account. So because some hackers with bad intentions not only kill people unfairly and gain little to no fun >.< But they also have bad ways to force a bugged or a hacked item into your inventory that can cause a soft ban or corrupt your files :/ or simply dropped hacked items for you to pick up if you are new to the game that will ruin your system.I lost my account twice first time i lost my level 210 character is because i formatted my computer and i didn't know that steam cloud doesn't support ds3 :< And the second time i lost my level 281 character is because i picked up a bugged or a hacked item that ruined my system so i decided to delete all my save files >.< and i've read later on that it's not needed to delete the account, but the character itself. and what i also read about the soft ban ( soft ban is a temporary that prevents you from playing online until you delete or remove the hacked bugged item that you picked up) So soft ban goes away after couple of weeks but i haven't experienced it myself and i hope i wont ever again >.< Thank you and i wish you the best of luck and a wonderful experience on your ds3 journey!",1
Positive,"I've never played any game that had swordplay before or third person. I actually thought I would hate this game to its guts, but the hype from the fanbase was just too much. I decided to preorder and give it a shot. When I began playing the game on the first day, I struggled to use keyboard and mouse(A shame there is no kb/m overlay). As a result, I died many times and I kept struggling to actually attempt to enjoy the game. However, after many defeats and many dissatisfactions, I finally beat my first boss WITH A KEYBOARD AND MOUSE! Now, I don't usually get hyped after completing a tutorial level, but this game was totally different. It didn't just give me some mindless skeletons to fight, but it also gave me a boss to fight, which by the way, gave me a headache.Each level was more enormous than the one before it with enemies that were sometimes huge. When I finally beat the game, I couldn't believe it was finally over. I was actually sad that there no more remaining bosses that could give me suffering and frustration. In my opinion, this game turned me into a masochist. Though, what the hell is up with all this weird English poetic stuff? Did the writers just read Shakespeare and decide to write in whatever word they thought had a good ring to it?10/10",1
Positive,"most polished souls-like game in your steam libraryits not perfect but its nice.I have great memories with this.People say Dark Souls saved their lives and more stuff. Good. Lives saved is nice.I'm here for the funny gameplay. I am an explorer who was on an adventure for no reason but 1 - I knew that someone had completed this and all the other souls-borne games without taking a single hit. That means the combat will not betray me if i'm smart and skillful enough. I felt powerful. And i did it. Slowly i move, i die i learn and i cheese i throw stuff, i talk and i run.I had fun. TL;DR - One of the Best Games to play with friends. Just don't give up on the tutorial, You can do it Ashen one. I believe in me who believes in you.

Positive,"Dark Souls 3 is my favorite game in the entire series, I have played every Souls(Borne) game in the entire series, that includes Demon's Souls, Bloodborne.This game came out on top with the ton of references to the other games in the series, and it did a damn good job respecting the series, and might I say it. Going out with a BANG.The ending in Dark Souls 3 is incredible, it's super powerful for anyone who has played the previous entries in the series. I of course won't spoil it, that would be really stupid of me. (But seriously, I REALLY recommend playing Dark Souls 1/2 before even playing this, if you don't do that you won't get the references to the previous games and the ending sure as hell won't be as powerful. It's the perfect ending to a strong adventure of which I am so happy that I have partaken in during all these years)The Armors, the weapons, the characters, the music. Dark Souls 3 has some of the strongest music tracks in the series, from the main theme, to the final credits theme. The final music in the credits practially whispers to you in a soft way Finale And they completely nailed it.The amount of friends I have taken through the lands of Lordran, Drangleic and even all the way down to the lowest of the lowest of the Nexus in Demon's Souls. Playing this game with my friend who has kept me company during all the other Soul games was truly amazing. We decided to solo the final boss instead of coop, for obvious reasons. and it was so powerful.(I have played way more solo, rather than coop. I'm not a carried scrub, I do the carrying trust me)I'm not kidding, I think I have literally taken more than 15 people through the lands of Dark Souls, and every single adventure has been amazing.(As a matter of fact, as of writing this review I'm taking another friend of mine through Dark Souls 3, It's an amazing series and I have to show it to people.)Dark Souls is a franchise that will go all the way down through the years in gaming, and people will relish and remember this series. And people will remember the ending of Dark Souls 3 and say - ""That's how you end a franchise"" Writing all of this I realise how much of a nerd I am, but I am super proud of this series, and everyone who has stayed strong with this series. Thanks all of you, even the toxic Havel armor wearing scrublords, we love all of you.PRAISE THE SUN! \[T]/",1
Positive,Great game with awesome levels design and really challenging bosses. Love the look and feel of this game. I still think the first dark souls is better but this is a true sequel to the first game. I'll give this game a 4.7/5 and I'll recommend this game to everyone.,1
Positive,"The sequel that the original Dark Souls deserved is a stunning game. The third is not only the most challenging part of the Souls series, but it's the most dynamic, fluid and deep in gameplay. The more linear design is founded in variety of challenges that force the player to adapt in their approach to combat, but there still is plenty of hidden areas and branching paths to keep you guessing, immersing yourself in exploration.",1

Positive,"Dark Souls III is something truly incredible. It has managed to provide me with a gut-wrenching, arduous experience. I have never felt so convulsed while playing a video game. It has made me feel short of breath as I peered through every dark and narrow opening, hunting for each and every achievement in the game. Dark Souls III has managed to antagonise myself enough for me to be yelling at the computer screen and release unconventional anger. If by any chance, you ever feel as though you should be playing this game, or that you are missing out on something very enjoyable, please do not ruin your life for $60 and just go and entice yourself to GTA V for an extra $15. Type 'PAINKILLER' in the console and you will be smiling like a kid that just lost his virginity.11/10 EXTREMELY rewarding but requires an immense amount of time, patience and persistence.I LOVE you Dark Souls III !",1
Positive,"Read this if you just want to hear what I think about the game.Dark Souls III does just enough to make the gameplay loop feel fresh, with refined combat mechanics as well as a couple of new features. Its bosses are all well-designed, and so are the many areas. It does feel a little too safe, leaning too much on the lore of the first game, resulting in a backstory not as engaging as that of the first Dark Souls.+ Well-designed bosses+ The overall selection of areas is very satisfying+ Lots of potential in terms of character builds- Feels a bit safe, especially with the lore consisting mostly of references to the first game.- Inconsistent framerateSCORE: GreatClick here to see my rating chartRead this if you want all the details.The Dark Souls series is probably one of the most influential in gaming. Dark Souls 3 marks the end of a beloved series, but is it as good as it's predecessors?Let's start with probably the most important part of a Soulsborne game - the gameplay, and more specifically, the combat. At first, it might seem like there isn't anything new here, other than the combat feeling more refined and less clunky. But as you begin to acquire more weapons, you'll probably introduce yourself to one of the biggest changes to combat: Weapon Skills. Each weapon has a certain skill that can be used in combat. This could be something as simple as a flurry attack, or something as cool as setting the area around you on fire. I'm pretty sure these skills are inspired by the trick-weapons seen in Bloodborne, and while they aren't as fleshed out as those, they still help make the weapon selection feel a bit more varied. The way magic works have also been altered a bit. In the first game, each spell had a specific amount of times it could be cast before you weren't able to use it until you reached the next bonfire. In this game, From Software has introduced a new bar besides Health and Stamina, called Focus. Focus is used every time you cast magic or use a weapon skill, and can also be filled by consuming Ashen Estus Flasks or resting at a bonfire. I do feel like this system would've worked better if the bar would automatically regenerate, as the amount of times you can use magic feels very limited, and makes character builds focused on magic less powerful overall. One of the most iconic things in the Soulsborne series is, of course, the boss battles. In Dark Souls 3 there's not as many in total as in previous entries, but they do feel more varied, and some of them present some very cool ideas. Just like in Bloodborne, most bosses have multiple phases, each with their own moves. This is a good addition to the great boss design and makes each boss a lot more unpredictable. My biggest issue with the bosses in the game is that most of them don't feel very challenging compared to the ones the first game presented. There were only a few bosses where I really felt like one single mistake would be fatal, and most of these were found towards the latter half of the game. What helped me to accept this is how none of them felt like a bad boss. Even though the first game had some of the finest and most well-designed bosses in a game, it did also have a lot of bland and uninspired ones, such as the tedious Bed of Chaos. The same could be said for some of the game's areas - just take a look at Lost Izalith. This is another place where I feel like this game struck gold - out of the many areas, there wasn't a single one which outright irritated me. Sure, there were a couple of areas that were a bit bland, but the overall selection was very good. It did have your occasional poison swamps, but even those felt like a fair experience. This is mainly due to the fantastic level design. Everything seems so thoughtfully put together and results in an overall satisfying experience. The game was sometimes too generous with its bonfires, and there was even a time where two bonfires were pretty close to each other, with no enemies in between. I do miss the interconnectivity of the first game, and I had really hoped that this would be something FromSoftware would try to do again with this game. It isn't a major complaint, but just something I would've liked to see.In terms of lore, the game leans heavily on references to the first game, and I would wish it had introduced a story on the level of that of Gwyn's from the first game, as many of the new characters simply doesn't feel as fleshed out as the ones found in Dark Souls 1. I can appreciate the fact that the game reintroduces an area from the first game, as well as a couple of well-known faces, but its lore leans too much towards this, resulting in everything feeling a bit safe. This is the biggest problem I have with the game overall - it plays a lot on nostalgia, instead of taking chances, like FromSoftware usually is known for. I haven't seen all of the NPC quests through, but judging from the ones I did, I felt like most of them ended with the NPC invading me, forcing me to kill them. The game could've had a bit more variety here. I've always thought the Soulsborne games had some amazing sceneries, and this is also the case here. While the graphics aren't anything impressive upfront, the sceneries are what makes the game so beautiful. There's always been a charm in standing at the top of an area, looking down on everything you've just overcome, while also being able to see what the game has in store for you next. While the game ran pretty well on my mid-range PC, I did experience some stuttering at times, and somehow adjusting the graphics settings doesn't really do any noticeable difference. Just by doing a quick search online, it seems I'm not the only one with these problems, and it sounds like it's an issue regardless of how good your PC is. Also, the game really doesn't do a good job at hiding that it was made with consoles in mind. In fact, even while using keyboard and mouse, the game will still display controls as if you were playing with a controller, meaning that whenever you're in doubt what to press, you have to go into the options menu. I, of course, decided to play with a controller, as that tends to be the best for these kinds of games, and even then, I had problems with setting it up, since the official profile resulted in the mouse cursor moving whenever the game detected movement from your controller. After some adjusting though, everything worked fine, and just if I was playing on a regular console.If you liked this review, I would appreciate it if you took the time to check out some of my other reviews here.

Positive,"This game is just amazing, the lore is pretty tricky to follow but when you star to understand it and love it. the exploration is so deep and terrifying, the coop is amazing and the boss fight are always so intense and full of joy when you beat that damn boss who kicked your ass thousands of times.Thanks to all people that played with me online (even you invaders) you make the experience much better",1

Positive,"absolutely fantastic game, its a lot tougher than elden ring in some areas but overall a very good game with unique bosses and areas to explore.",1
Positive,Invasions are really fun in this game. 10/10 would reccommend to someone looking for a unique PVP experience.,1
Positive,"Masterful architecture, stunning graphics, wonderful level design, full of shorcuts and the fights. The tactical side behind each fight leaves so spoiled that every other game fighting mechanic seems rather simplistic and boring in comparison.Definitely, the culmination of one of the most engrossing trilogies I've ever witnessed and an absolute, maddening joy to play and to master.10/10",1
Positive,"Dark Souls 3 is a pretty good, but certainly not great ending to the Souls series. Playing this game I never did got the same great vibe I got from Dark Souls 1 & 2. Some of the bosses on the game or nothing short of disappointing, the questlines to some characters have little payoff (though some are great), and the game leans very heavily on past nostalgia from Dark Souls 1, with improved combat mechanics. Buuut. Did I hate this game? Oh no. I loved it. It is a Souls game still, true and true. The lore is amazing, and still found through gameplay and not cutscenes. Combat is faster than ever, there are even more amazing boss weapons, and some areas are larger than before. But there are aspects of it that will frustrate you.Pros: -Faster combat, and maneuverability -Some areas are definitely longer. -Still has the good old Souls feel -Lore is given to the interested players through very optional ways -PvP funner than ever -Co-op with friends is easier, with a password that allows you to summon only those with the same password Cons:-Wether the new weapon skill system was neccessary, is subjective. -Some areas are definitely longer. but there are fewer of them and some are very very annoying. -Summoning is sometimes a pain in the ass, as it fails if you summon more than 1 phantom simultaneously. -End bosses are mostly disappointing. -A lot of unwarranted nostalgia from DS1 holds this game up -Seems a little too easy for some.",1
Positive,A peaceful autumn game.,1
Positive,"TL;DR - The concept is good. I love how the game conveys that this is Dark Souls 3 . The gritty atmosphere, and the lore behind it, is attractive and interesting. However, the overall gameplay is a bit of disappointment. IMHO, the game is good for only the FIRST playthrough.PvP / Invading / Dueling is kind of nice, on paper, really, but it is actually kind of broken, when it comes to real thing.Be warned, your first playthough can takes from 10-60 hours depending on your playstyle, however, your following playthrough can be finished much faster. (3-5 hours)Feel likes more reading? Continue below:(I won t be mentioning about what is good already, but the disappointments)I wouldn t dare say that the game can be described as hard, nor challenging, but instead, imo, punishes those who blindly rush in thinking that they can slash their ways through the mobs.I am certain that you will be sent back to the bonfire for a few times in each newly discovered areas/encounters, but once you learnt about each of them, you can easily control each encounter, then after that, comes down to how you perform for each fight.Despite what I mentioned above, here is a big BUT , they are all coming down to one single problem. The badly designed AI.Let s say, you masked your approach with a spell (silencing your steps), you melee one mob from the group, the nearby members will notice you (if they are actually nearby). However, if you change your approach, getting close enough to shoot with arrows/bolts, and then pull it away from the group. Not a soul will notice that his/her friend is missing.Again, you are facing one trouble-some beast on the small bridge (for its size), you decided to pull back from the bridge area hoping to get away from the beast, then found out that it won t follow you off the bridge area, and decided to stand and stare at you in the face, you then attempt to get into melee range, and bash away with your half-upgraded weapons, surprisingly, it stare back at you, doing nothing, but backing away until you get on the bridge again, allowing you free hits.Okay, you are on the narrow cliff, you saw a guy rushing down toward you at full speed, so you decided to dodge his attack. As he got close enough, he began charging toward you with his weapon at full-strength, you saw this opportunity, and rolled to the side, looking back to get ready for this guy. He s not there anymore, but off the cliff into his own abyss.These are some examples. There are many cheap ways to end the tough encounters, that you will find out during your playthrough, which is kind of sad.Just for your knowledge with the right equipments/setups, you can run through the whole things (not a completed one, but met all critical paths) in just a few hours, as you can just dash past everything to reach the boss.It is kind of pointless, imo. It is nice on the paper, but the actual thing is not. I am not talking about the rule, nor the honor or that kind of stuff, but the design itself.During my playthrough, I can hardly find Invaders that are not lagging, these can be resulted as weird hitboxes, not correctly displayed weapon ranges, delayed reactions, warping, or even ranged critical attacks. Trust me, facing likes 10 of these in a row is not fun. It is good when it works though. It just that, imo, the devs seem to forget to put in the factor that, not everyone is in the perfect conditions for these thing. Let s say, instead of the player invaders, it should be likes AI invaders, but takes the stats/equipments from other actual players, and make PvP into some kind of arena match. These would do a better job in handling smooth gameplay for more people than what it currently is, imo.I will be updating this later, If I feel right to do so.edit: typos",1
Positive,"This game really does go beyond the previous two games. Dark Souls 3's combat system and mechanics are sound, function properly, and goddamn i wish I could say the same about the first one.Problem; AI. for some reason, when Embered and invaded by mad spirits/dark spirits, trying to parry them or even get a backstab is near impossible, and when you make consecutive hits, all of a sudden, magic parry, adn then your health dwindles down to nothing. So I guess it's all swish swish stab and back away.Still, it take everything into a blender, mashes it up and throws the odd pickle in it, to give it some zest I guess. Even though that ticks me, I thoroughly enjoy it and see it as a great game for new players to try.",1

Positive,Best rage couch game ever,1
Positive,"Never feel like you're actually good at PvP because just remember, on your opponent's screen, you're teleporting everywhere.Also, lightning miracles OP.",1
Positive,"This game started off slow in all honesty, atleast until you beat the first 3 bosses, which should take like 1 - 2 hours, but this game after that threshold is absolutely amazing, the bosses are awesome, the level design is awesome, the game is just straight up awesome, I love this and don't regret buying it one bit, I almost like it as much as Elden Ring, but this game definitely has better overall bosses than Elden Ring, and is also (in my opinion) harder, especially the endgame bosses",1
Positive,"Over the last few years, From Software has grown in reputation thanks to the series and being one of the most challenging on the market. The previous Dark Souls I felt stepped away from what made the series great and left From Software in a position to recover with Dark Souls III. With 3, we have a mix of old and new designed to push (and punish) players further.Undead Again:As with previous games in the Souls series, you are an undead being cursed to wander the land until you eventually become hollow or insane. Upon awakening, you are given a quest to return the lords of cinder to their throne; this entails wandering a very big land and dying a lot. Just like the other games, there is a deep story hidden behind the lore, but I'm going to leave that for someone more versed in it to talk about.The basics of the Souls are on full display here: Using a skill and timing-based combat system, you're going to be fighting enemies of all shapes and sizes while looking for shortcuts and the ever vital bonfires for checkpoints. As with Dark Souls 2, bonfires automatically allow you to teleport to them once found; allowing for quick travel to and from.Gone is the controversial adaptation stat that affected invincible frames, and the game is back to keeping them consistent across characters. There are a few new base changes to the gameplay to give players more options. The first is that your eastus flask which is your only source of healing is now split into two. You have one flask for healing and one flask for recovering flame points or FP. FP is used for using spells and special skills that are unique to each weapon type.The skills are a holdover from Bloodborne and are meant to give you more options in combat, and allow melee-focused characters a reason to boost their FP up.You can assign how many of your total charges to the different flasks, and of course upgrade your flasks to restore more with each swig.Previous games had a mechanic built around living and dying in the game: From the complex and level altering light/dark tendency in Demon's Souls, to a simple measurement in the previous Dark souls.In Dark Souls III, you can use ember to earn a flame which gives you a higher max health and puts you in a position to summon help or be invaded as long as you don't die.You'll need all of these, as Dark Souls III continues the difficult tradition of the series.Swinging a Sword:The Souls series is known for having very challenging and rewarding combat, thanks to diverse enemies and boss fights. Dark Souls III definitely takes things up a notch in both areas. Regular enemies are more varied and a lot more dangerous this time around.The reason is that enemies are faster, more aggressive and have been given more combo chains for their attacks. In previous games, an enemy would attack at most two or three swings in a single chain. Now, they will attack with more swings in a single string and their strings are more varied.For instance, enemies may perform three swings that look the same, but have two or more different combo endings to them. They also have more attacks, including those designed to punish players for using previously effective strategies.I've ran into enemies who knew how to get around circle strafing or attack you if you keep swinging too much.Bosses are also more varied and remind me of Dark Souls 1 in terms of variety and different solutions to beating them. Just like before, you can summon characters to help you or be summoned to recover your flame and get some souls in the process.From a moment-to-moment standpoint, Dark Souls III continues the greatness of the series, but there are some issues hiding under the surface.Hollowed Out:Dark Souls 3 has all the good elements of previous Souls games, but it also has all the bad as well. The camera continues to have trouble with not getting stuck while fighting larger enemies and the increased speed makes it hard for it to keep up.Of the three games and Demon's Souls (haven't played Bloodborne yet,) this one takes the cake for roughest start for new players. Unlike Demon's Souls that had a great beginning to run things by the player, you are thrust within minutes into your first boss fight and expected to learn or die.What makes Dark Souls different from Demon s was the fact that the world was open-ended; allowing you to explore different sections that were still connected to the world's geography. Dark Souls 3 feels somewhat limited in this regard. The starting areas have a sameness to them and the connectivity between areas has been downplayed in favor of just shortcuts within each area. While this is better than the confusing world of Dark Souls 2, it doesn't beat Dark Souls 1 for world creation.All the problems that have been inherent in the Souls series is back: Unhelpful camera, enemies attacking and glitching thru certain obstacles and each other, camera still getting stuck when fighting large enemies and so on. While people may have gotten used to them, it's still a mark against the game by the fact that nothing has been done it seems to try and fix them.The new concern at the moment has to be the technical issues plaguing the game and some underlining mechanic issues. There is a bug going on that causes massive framerate lost, stuttering or simply game crashes due to the lighting.It happens at specific points in the game which makes it all the more frustrating that it wasn't caught. And of course, people have been having connectivity issues with joining games. There are also issues on the console versions as well; hopefully From Software will get those straighten out.Also, there are some points to discuss with the underlining mechanics and changes of Dark Souls III. The short version is that there are several mechanical changes that impact poise and armor, and their impact on both PvE and PvP. Unfortunately, they're way too big to get into detail about here, but that will be saved for a massive post coming to Game-Wisdom soon.Light the Fire:From Software continues to make subtle improvements to the moment-to-moment gameplay, but still is having trouble with the overall problems and concerns of the series. As with previous games, you're either going to love it or hate it for its ramped up difficulty and challenging fights.If you're new, I would still suggest either Demon's Souls or Dark Souls to get your feet wet (maybe Bloodborne, but I haven't played it,) as Dark Souls III really feels like it was designed for someone with one of the games already under their belt. For me, I find the game at the moment lands too much on the side of being cheap with its mechanics to really enjoy fully. Just like with Dark Souls 2, expect a second post on Game-Wisdom talking explicitly about the gameplay to come soon.Anybody worried that this would be a continuation of Dark Souls II, fear not, Dark Souls III is clearly better in every aspect, but to compare it to one, well, I got a ""few"" words to say about that in another post.For more content on Dark Souls III, you can watch my depraved run on the Game-Wisdom YouTube channel.

Positive,"This game helps me realize that in order to face your fears, you must face them head on and keep trying and trying and trying until you've slain it. Dark Souls 3 is nothing but cope juice when the real world is against you and nothing is left but loneliness. At least for me, this game helps me forget the real world, this game allows me to adventure into the unknown alone and come out strong, this game aids in testing your limits in the right way possible. Besides sleep, this game offers nearly the same thing, peace. Peace is precious, something that needs to be held close, and to never be let loose. Mind goes blank as the game starts up, and the shift is reinstated as soon as the game closes. I cannot think much than praise. As of writing this review, I have ventured far beyond NG+7 and I am continuing to master this games' techniques. This is possibly one of the greatest games the 21st century has to offer, I cannot help but keep praising this game for everything it teaches through every error and victory. Life is Dark Souls",1

Positive,"This game really feels like the culmination of everything From and Miyazaki have been doing with the series. It's incredibly tight, combat is sped up (albeit not to the level of Bloodborne) and the world is ALIVE. Early in the game, you come to a cliff side and below you stretches, literally, the whole game. You can see all the locations you will soon be visiting, its an awe inspiring moment, and really sets the tone. Meanwhile, if you're a lore hound, prepare to boggle at how much is packed in here. Everything around you tells a story and drips with history. This really is the continuation of Dark Souls. Oh, Covenants also are majorly improved upon, allowing switching on the fly and letting players really explore play styles until they find something that really is for them. It's incredible. As of right now, I have completed the game once, clocking in at 50 hours, and have already rolled up a new character to do it again.New Game+ will happen eventually, but I wanted to go through it again with new players first. There is also a way for players to re-spec later in the game, which is nice.",1
Positive,"I have started DS3 after I completed Sekiro 3 times and honestly it felt easier. Telegraphing enemy moves and dodge is a lot fun.

There are few bosses and areas that will challenge you, thou (yes, Midir I am looking at you).Regardless, beating every boss fight and stage is epic and it satisfies you. Do not listen others that say the game is too difficult. It is challenging but if you want, you can partner with your friend and others so they can also help you.

The art, the war, the tactic, the ability to adapt and learn are all in these games.it started from demon souls and darksouls 1 and years ago i started to play these games but it remained unfinished due to compromised console. but finally i started and i am enjoying a real game.i have diminished my wishlist from over 100+ to around 24 games. and i have become strict in choosing a game to play. I never have said such a thing before but these fromsoftware games are worth complete price .see?only 6-8 games worth full price and are these. try to purchase in discounted price now tho.if u wanna enjoy your old games dont play these cause all will be trash to you as they are now to me.only few number left worthy to me.anyway praise the sun praise the fromsoftware hope the never disappoint us as they never did. and GIT GUDSo longDarkman",1

Im crap at the game however, recognising patterns has never been one of my strong points so i struggle particularly with the bosses who are heavily scripted. Still ive managed to finish the game after 70 odd hours of sheer determination and thats what makes the game so satisfying.The thrill you get after beating a boss is second to none, and even just finally navigating on of the games many beautiful areas (in a warped sort of way) is exhilarating after dozens of deaths.Theres nothing i can really say about Dark Souls 3 that hasnt been said already. it really is worth getting and sticking with if fantasy/ Rpg type games are your thing.",1
Positive,"Best Dark Souls game of the serie so far(played 23 hours in two days). Optimization is really well made. I have never had any crash or FPS drop. My settings are currently on ""MAX"" and i am having constant 45 fps with a mid budged PC.PROS: Level design is incredible and you can easily get lost in the wast world. (always some hidden places to explore)Combat system is DA BEST! It is fast paced, balanced and unforgiving.AI is clever and i mean it.

Positive,"First off; I actually beat this game. (My achievements say otherwise) This frustrating, cheap, challenging masterpiece, is one of my recent favorites. I m sad I didn t get into the series sooner. The first 40 hours or so of this game was hard for me. Since I never played a Souls game before; I didn t know how to approach combat nor how to manage my Estus. I died, a lot. However; once I got halfway through the game, I got gud as they say. Now almost to NG+ I m excited to try the game all over again. :DMy love for this series and DS3 itself will forever hold a place is my heart. PSThe Nameless King and The Abyss Watchers are my favorite Boss fights.",1
Positive,"I now put around 100 hours into this game and I can definetly recommend it. Long story short:+ graphics are really good. Most if not all locations look beautiful. The developers paid a lot of attention to details.+ sound is great and ""realistic"". Dark Souls 3 features by far the best soundtrack in the series. The theme of the Abyss Watchers is a prime example. The voice acting is also pretty good. + combat is fluid and faster as in Dark Souls and Dark Souls 2.+ a lot of armour, weapons, spells, miracles and pyromancies. + great multiplayer - yeah, it is basically the same as in 1 and 2 but this kind of multiplayer is unique compared to any other franchise (I include Demon's Souls and Bloodborne into the Souls franchise).+ really good quests which enrich the story and are not thrown into your face like in any other RPG.+ really good length. Doesn't matter if you include the DLC or not.- invasions or PVP in general can be annoying due to latency issues or lag. Only the arena (accessable while playing the DLC) features a server. The rest is P2P.- backtracking for additional armour doesn't make much sense - discover location A, 5 hours later, at location X, you kill a certrain unique enemy, armour can now be found at location A. I'm talking about Havel's armour to be specific.- the first DLC, Ashes of Ariandel, is pretty poor on it's own when it comes to length and variety. But since anybody who buys the game probably buys the complete edition anyway, this does not mean much. I just wanted to point that out. Especially since both DLC's belong together - literally. - some enemy types can be seen as a recycled version of an earlier enemy later on. It is not that obvious as in other games but still. Seems kinda lazy.I can definetly recommend the purchase of this game. It does not matter if it is on sale or not. In my opinion, it still is worth 60 bucks. Compare it to ""triple A"" trash from Activision or EA and you can pay 100 without batting an eye.",1
Positive,"Even after playing though this game countless times I still find enjoyment in starting fresh with a new challenge or build idea in mind. If you're new to this sort of game I suggest choosing the knight class since it starts off with a long sword and a shield with decent stability and complete physical damage protection. With how well distributed its stats are, you'll be able to expand out to other playstyles a short time after starting the game (e.g an intellagence, fait or pyro build). I also suggest going solo as much as you can since this will allow you to learn enemy/boss attack patterns and where you'll be able to get your hits in. Take a look around yourself when you can, by the way. Even at 720p at the lowest settings, this game looks beautiful. Especially some of the far off views that are now a part of my folder I use for desktop backgrounds.",1
Positive,"The best example for Love/Hate relationshipThis is the final game in the series for now and I am unsure if a new souls game will be released. The Ringed City DLC seems to be the last installment for the dark souls series. I am excited to see their new ip and hope it surpasses the souls series. What is DS3; If you are a fan of the Dark Souls series and completed the first two games a while back, you should purchase the third installment without delay, as I did. I believed I had experienced everything with Dark Souls, especially with Dark Souls 2, but when I purchased Dark Souls 3, I was surprised by the significant improvement from its predecessor. The difference between the two games is so vast that words cannot do it justice.It's similar to the dark souls experience we've been craving for ages.It also includes elements from previous Dark Souls games and even from Demon's Souls <3.Dark Souls 2 failed to meet my expectations, causing me to overlook Dark Souls 3. Don't repeat my mistake (even though Dark Souls 2 isn't awful and has its own charm, it didn't meet my expectations), try playing Dark Souls 3 instead. It's like a hidden gem, but in truth it holds more value than you think. I can't put my emotions into words ( ) haha :P. Good luck to everyone and enjoy playing dark souls 3 with a smile. Don't forget to remain patient and develop your own tactics to enhance your fun. DS3 differs from other Souls game series since it provides more clarity, allowing players to quickly understand their objectives, directions, and reasoning behind actions within the first 2-4 hours. However, I hold this belief because of how much our understanding of the game has grown since we first played Dark Souls 1 on the PS3/xbox360 with no prior knowledge. I could be correct or mistaken, but you should test out the game on your own. I immediately recommend that Dark Souls 3 boasts superior PvP compared to the rest of the series. I believe that, at a specific moment, it stands out as one of the greatest features in comparison to other Souls games. Examine the game to confirm or refute my assertion. I appreciate you reading my review. _Be aware from :The online matching in the game is done through the process below:-Players who do not match with the same regulation versions are excluded ""u and ur friends needs to have the same update"".-Players who cannot connect with the network type (mainly NAT3) are excluded ""TL:DR same as console type 1,2,3 idea""=Players that are outside the host range parameter will be excluded.-Players who are from different regions are excluded=Based on the host, players who have out of ranged advanced weapon levels are excludedThe player level and the weapon level are less effective in the password matching.What does that mean?If you and your friend haven't set a password, and your character level is 140 while your friend is only level 40 and just starting the game, make sure to use a password in order to bypass these limitations and assist your friendIf you want calculation: (Keep in mind the margin of error here is +/-10If the host level is 40-Minimum phantom level you could summon is=26=Maximum phantom level you could summon is=54If the host level is 120-Minimum phantom level you could summon is=98=Maximum phantom level you could summon is=142If the host level is 140-Minimum phantom level you could summon is=116=Maximum phantom level you could summon is=164",1

Positive,One of the best gaming experiences I've ever had.,1
Positive,"Brief: Score: 1000/100. An absolutely amazing 3rd Person RPG. One of the best games I ve ever played, and I recommend it to anyone looking to get into Dark Souls or continuing their adventures in Dark Souls.This game is one of the greatest games ever made. Heck, this game is one of the top three greatest artistic achievements ever made. The only negative is it's probably one of the easiest games ever made. Despite the easy sauce covering this game, Dark Souls 3 fills you with a feel good story, a sense of optimism, and never say quit attitude. This game is a breath of fresh air in the current era where game designers spend way to much time making hard games that frustrate gamers. The story is straight forward and simple. There is no need to guess or speculate. In fact it puts the story codex right on the items. Finally, on the rare occasion that you die, the game will let you know just in case you missed it. BS aside, this is really the game of the year from 2016. It makes Dishonored 2 seem like a joke. It makes Titanfall 2 look like a a newspaper comic strip. And even Witcher 3, DLC included, fails to compare. I recommend this game. If I could get a hold of a FUMES great sword, and somehow figure out a way to lift it, I would force you to buy it (for your own good).",1

Make sure to keep this in mind as it's extremely important, you don't want to lose your progress",1
Positive,"It's pretty neat, although I wouldn't consider it the best entry in the Souls games. I'm just going to list things that I enjoyed and things that I thought were done better in the previous games. So let's start with the graphics, which look very familiar if you played Bloodborne. It's definitely an upgrade to the previous Souls games and the locations are absolutely stunning so there is really nothing I could complain about in this departement. The combat is a bit faster now which is fine by me. There is also Weapons Art and the the addition of the Focus Points which I, as a UGS wielder never actually used. Perhaps it has its uses for some situations but I never encountered those. Poise is drastically changed now, I could wear full Havels and become staggered by some rat or a starved dog. I'm not sure what From was thinking when implemanting those changes. Other then that the PvE and PvP are very enjoyable and there are a lot more people to play with. The game difficulty swaps around a bit. For instance the only challenging area was Archdragon Peak for me. Maybe it's just me and after 3 games I already got used to the concept and gameplay so that's why I would consider Dark Souls 1 as the most challenging of them all. Game seems a lot shorter even for someone who has to ""100% every area available"". Steam says that I spend aroung 120 hours on DS1, DS2 and Bloodborne yet I have ""only"" 50 on DS3 and I almost finished it. All in all the game has it flaws here and there but in the end it's very enjoyable and something that I would recommend on buying to someone who enjoyed the previous games. It's also probably the best game to start with if you want to play the Soulsborne games as it seems a bit more beginner friendly.Oh, I forgot to say that the music is ridiculously good which is really worth mentioning.",1
Positive,"After 1000 hours, i'm ready to write my review, first of all i must say that this is my favorite game of all TIME, the amount of art and detail put into this game is overwhelming, Dark souls 3 is made with heart without a doubt from the soundtrack to the characters, jesus the worlds that miyazaki created in this game, i remember the first time i set foot in Irythill of the Boreal Valley i was left astonished, simply amazing.This game reminds me of the old days when i would go buy a game and get the FULL experience, no micro-transactions, only hard work to unlock all the weapons and costumes for my character, also the amount of customization for your character is amazing, there's probably more than 30+ sets to fully customize your character, you can use a single piece of each set, to create your own abomination.This is where i'm going to be a little pesimistic about the game if played on PC, the amount of cheaters is dreadful and FromSoftware doesn't give a flying duck if you were modified with GOD MODE by a hacker, you'll get banned too, i've had friends permanently banned from the online experience, just because a stupid hacker modified their account, sometimes they'll insta kill all the bosses in the map, which will cause invalid data registry in your account as well, however if you get banned you can fix this by making a family-sharing account and playing from there, still you'll have to start from 0 again and like i said FromSoftware won't give a damn if you were not cheating, they'll only see the invalid data and give you a warning to delete it or they'll perm ban, so be CAREFUL with what you pick from other players, other than that invading is AMAZING, it's hilarious to make riot in anothers ashen one's worlds.The game runs smooth if you meet the requirments 60+ fps no problems, the only problem i have encountered is if you use a DS4 with DS4WINDOWS, it can cause some crashes here and there.Dark souls 3 is worth every single penny you spend on it, it's by far the ultimate RPG adventure, if you have friends to play with, it's even better. 9/10",1
Positive,Finished the game on my PS4. One of the best fucking games ive ever played i cant wait to play it on PC :D,1
Positive,"Dark Souls 3 is technically and design wise the strongest game in the trilogy, providing both a great start to newcomers to the series and also a fitting end (hopefully) to the game series. That said it does also lack some elements that made the original more memorable and takes a step back in some regards to how Dark Souls 2 functioned. Regardless the whole game acts as a coherent whole similar to the original, though not without caveats.If you step away from the rather nonsensical ""git gud"" and ""HARDEST GAME EVA!"" style of buzzwording and advertising spiel focusing on Dark Souls' difficulty curve, an element I'm not going to plunge into too much as it has been focused on to death in other places, possibly the main draw to the Souls series has been its world building and combat. The original Dark Souls had one of the greatest world designs I've possibly ever seen in games, where everything functioned as a coherent whole with some lovely trickery to catch out players. Dark Souls 2 however seemed to fluff this up rather badly both with giving the player the ability to warp between fires from the get-go and rather uninspired and illogical level design: Hello lava coved plateau accessed by climbing a tower.Dark Souls 3 thankfully takes some steps back to the more coherent visions of DS1. From the early area in the High Wall of Lothric you can see the majority of locations stretching off into the distance below the high city, as you can also see the locations stretching back up from the bottom, including a rather fantastic deep trench from a place called Irathil. The world is laid out in a coherent manner and, like the original Dark Souls, if you could see something far off not only does that mean you can most likely go there, but it also will be in a roughly correct geographical location. Despite this nice move back to the coherent whole world of DS1 warping between bonfires from the start returns. The levels themselves spiral around and shortcuts appear in a rather wonderful way similar to how DS1 worked, especially in The Cathedral of the Deep (a single bonfire covers most of this area, and its great) and the afore mentioned Irathil, however they all feel like self contained ""levels"" so to speak, where each area feels like a shrunken version of DS2's DLC areas. There are no moments where you take an elevator from Darkroot and suddenly find yourself in the Valley of the Drakes, or even the link between there, Blightown and New Londo. Despite this the actual design of each of these areas is so well executed I don't think it matters so much, with tricks and traps everywhere, and enemies that scream of ""this is impossible!"" before you learn the trick and navigate the areas with ease later.Connected with the world building is the story and lore. In this Dark Souls 3 is a fine return to form, that being if you can fathom out the story and its purposeful obtuseness. Like the previous Souls games DS3 delivers a narrative that is very much unique to video games: this would not function as a book or a film. Everything is obtuse, covered in mystery and is very rarely explained. Enemy placement, item placement, item descriptions and the scant bits of info salvaged from NPCs fills in the holes of the ""Go get these blokes, kill that other bloke and set yourself on fire"" the game seems to give. Again, I will not plumb these depths as there are some rather fantastic explorations into DS's lore on YouTube. Suffice to say that the background for Dark Souls 3 is a fitting end to the series, if I am indeed correct.Combat wise the game has taken a step back to DS1 with its controls. Parrying is not as random as DS2 as well as guard breaks and leap attacks are not as difficult. It retains the way that breaking guards opens people up to ripostes like DS2, and that is welcome, and essentially makes the general combat feel as satisfactory as ever, if a little faster in the wake of Bloodborne. Some elements have taken a step back such as the way weapons only buff in the manner they did in DS1, where a lot of weapons could not buff or whatnot and also duel wielding items cannot be power stanced. Slightly annoying but not crippling.My main complaints mainly stem from the rather buggy nature DS3 seems to have. Of the 3 games in the trilogy DS3 has given me the most problems, with mobs clipping through the world (and me at times) to multiplayer elements glitching out (cannot enter boss fogs) and at least 4 of the PvP convents just flat out not working. Maybe these will be fixed with patches (provided he does not kick people off ledges), but right now there are a multitude of issues which makes the game hard to recommend right now. Net code is also as weird as it has always been, causing some players to hit you from large distances while doing PvP or sometimes character models, both enemies and human players, to loose all animations and being incapable of attacking. By this point though if I have come to expect one goofy thing via From Soft games, its wonky net play.A slight other complaint may be the somewhat lazy elements of recycled elements in the game. The degree of fan service in the games from the prior titles is a bit grating. Some may enjoy it, but when a person wearing a very familiar set of armour appeared with the mannerisms of a DS1 character appeared I rolled my eyes. As it is, this is all dependent on how much you can tolerate this stuff.At the end of the day I find it hard not to recommend DS3. It is the most polished and well thought out game in the series from a design stand point, though is slightly glitchy and buggy in spots. I still do not think it is as good as DS1, but it is leagues ahead of DS2. In this regard I imagine this may be remembered in a similar manner to how Final Fantasy IX was: FFVII was the classic everyone remembers, FFVIII was the awkward follow up and FFIX was the classic that ended up being the polished finality to that era, though ended up overlooked mainly due to the fact it was not FFVII. Give it a shot, it will certainly be worth it.",1
Positive,I died. Many times. Even Chuck Norris cannot beat this game without dying.Best game of all time.,1
Positive,"I have played all DS games and bloodborne (all on console). This game is EVERYTHING that DS2 should have been. The leveldesign from DS1 is back with ladders and connections between levels, and the whole feeling, atmosphere & lore of the game is much more in line with DS1. You basically get an improved DS1 with the bloodborne gfx-engine which looks beautiful on PC. I run it with a PS4 controller on 1080p maxed out and it has been amazing so far. 15 hours in. One big difference with the previous games is that the way/road to the bosses are tougher, but the bosses themselves seem to be a little bit easier overall. But overall, a harder journey since 90% of the gameplay is tougher. I LIKE IT!",1

Positive,"Dark souls 3 feels like a love letter to the community and fans who have played and been a part of this trilogy. It brings an epic conclusion to this intricate yet beautiful world of Dark Souls. The game has one of the strongest roaster of main bosses in the series. The bosses are challenging but very well balanced. Personally I felt the game is a bit easier as compared to the others in the series and that is because the game rewards the players who figure out and get used to the patterns and the mechanics the game has to offer. The game takes good amount of influence from Bloodborne, be it the faster combat or spooky areas with somewhat spooky enemies or lot of howling and shouting here and there etc. The game also has some really heart warming throwbacks to the OG Dark Souls and I loved how they picked up few interesting mechanics from DS2 as well. For me a really important aspect I look forward to in a souls game is the exploration bit. Going through the world, exploring secrets, finding shortcuts etc. This aspect in DS3 was somewhat weaker for me. Now there are secrets to uncover and shortcuts to find but the world felt a bit bland in terms of variety and it looks less vibrant. Having said that, I do understand that world is designed keeping in mind the context of the story and definitely the overall visual storytelling is very strong. The themes of decay and stagnation and very well depicted. An amazing game overall. PS: The DLCs are truly epic with some really memorable boss encounters. Ringed city is peak Dark Souls.",1

Positive,"Hello! This is my review of Dark Souls 3. I have to say, this game has so many amazing aspects to it. The sound quality is top-notch, the story is rich in depth, and hidden lore adds layers throughout the game. Overall, I'd highly recommend it because there's a plethora of activities to dive into across its diverse areas, offering plenty of exploration opportunities.The gameplay is incredibly smooth, and the controls are reminiscent of the previous games, which enhances the overall experience. For me, Dark Souls 3 was fantastic, offering more content than its predecessors. The bosses are notably more challenging, making it the toughest Souls game I've played.The armor sets and weapons are exceptionally well-designed, surpassing even those in Dark Souls 1 & 2. The music and cutscenes are immersive and beautiful, adding depth to the experience. The detailed lore adds another layer, making it a must-play for fans of the series.Dark Souls 3 expands upon its predecessor and offers a continuation of the story, regardless of the ending chosen in Dark Souls 1. The locations are captivating, and it's especially exciting to see areas from the first game reintroduced. If you're a fan of Dark Souls or any FromSoftware RPGs, you're bound to love it. - Rikka :D Extremely Great Boss Fights. Great Combat, A lot of weapons to use. Amazing Soundtrack and good sound quality. Outstanding story and lore. AI & NPCS are improved from the older games.",1

Positive,Dark souls and any game made by from software are the best games made in the modern era. My children will be playing every game made by them in time. These games and their story are equal in value to the highest valued art.,1
Positive,"I am in this game, this pleases me greatly. Iron Tarkus shall live on.",1
Positive,"Overall, the community is easy going and the players are kind to one another. You will find yourself being helped throughout the game with powerful npc s and fair mechanics. Other players will also be available to summon and will protect you from harm. This is a game for people who want to take it easy and enjoy themselves. One might say that the land is peaceful, its inhabitants kind.With that being said, be sure to check out Dark Souls III if you enjoy games that:are easy to learndon t have steep learning curvestell you where to godon t screw you over with unfair 1-hit comboshave a story you don t have to find out on your own",1
Positive,"This game is amazing. It is great for both first timers and people returning to the series. And don't let the rumors put you off. The game isn't as hard as you think. And trust me, when you find yourself in the intricate dance that is one of the boss fights, you just might find your heart pounding as you roll through the bosses attacks and counter with one of your own. It is a rush that few games can make you feel.The gameplay is fast and tight. Mistakes can be made, but you will pay for each and every one of them. The world, scenery and music are the most beautiful in the series. More than once you will find yourself gazing at an incredible view. The bosses and enemies are well designed and a joy to fight. The story stands on its own, but it also has quite a few callbacks to the earlier games. I can only think of nice things to say about this game. It is a well designed, albeit sometimes frustrating game, with a world and gameplay that few other games can match. Do yourself a favor and try it sometime.",1
Positive,"Thank you Mr Miyazaki for this masterpiece.!Strong as should be the 3rd part of the series.Very good graphics compared to the prequels,Weapon art an option to mix your moves on the field.Laggy sometimes on the pvp.Very strong single player needs patience and preparation.Not too hard as the 1st one.Overall a great game setting the standards high.Great work from FromSoftware.",1
Positive,"By far one of my favourite games of all time. I originally had this on Xbox and upon getting a good PC I instantly bought the game and the game looks stunningly beautiful on high settings. The game is well created, all the areas connect together fluently and the combat system is great. In conclusion, I believe that this game is definitely worth the expensive cost and is well worth the play.",1
Positive,"Dark Souls III is currently the latest game in the Dark Souls series. If this is your first Dark Souls game, you need to know that Dark Souls is well-known for its extremely hard difficulty, frustrating deaths, and slow grinding progress (because you'll lose everything if you fail to retrieve your dropped souls - or 'money'). In short, it's just completely merciless to the player. If you're a hardcore gamer that loves challenges, I heavily recommend this for you. Dark Souls is the type of game where the difficulty overwhelms the fun, so if you're a casual gamer looking to rekt some AIs easily and be a hero that saves the universe - don't buy this game. Know that your character will die a lot in this game. I mean, A LOT. So if you're the type of person that crushes things around you when you're frustrated, I also don't recommend this game for you to save your stuff.GameplayYou'll start with creating your character and choosing a class. And then, the slaughtering will start. Arguably overpowered enemies - usually in the form of monsters - will start popping out as you progress through the map and you'll gain 'souls' when you defeat them. You can spend your collected souls as soon as you find some kind of a 'checkpoint', usually in the form of a large area that consists of a blacksmith, a store, a bonfire (respawn point), and an NPC to upgrade your stats. You'll get to purchase weapons, armors, power-ups, stats, etc. in these checkpoints to give you a better fighting chance against the enemies. Each time you die, you'll drop ALL of your collected souls and you'll have to retrieve it the next time you respawn. If you die again, then you'll not be able to retrieve the souls you collected the first time you died. Only the last pack of souls will be dropped and retrievable. When you successfully dominates an 'area', you'll have to beat a boss fight to gain access to the next 'area'. Usually, the bosses are extremely overpowered and it'll take more than 10 retries to beat them. This is basically what you'll do the whole game. Walk - kill enemies - die - grind souls - die - purchase stuff - fight bosses - die - repeat.AdvantagesGraphics are way better than Dark Souls II. It's really nice to look at and overall, it's great. The main advantage of the game is the difficulty. Some of you, like me, may think ""What? Who finds getting killed over and over again, getting frustrated, punching stuff around you, or even throwing your CPU out of the window because you are p*ssed off as 'fun'?"". Well, people have different ideas of 'fun'. There are hundreds of thousands or even millions of players that loves the Dark Souls franchise. The overwhelming difficulty is what makes Dark Souls unique. Its PS4-only cousin, Bloodborne, also gained huge attention from gamers due to similar gameplay style. I personally don't find getting killed over and over again or fighting against overpowered enemies as 'fun' but I find the game greatly trains my mentality - it desensitized me from failure, which will be important in my pursue of success. But know this: this game is not all about death and failures. You'll learn how to fight with your brain instead of blindly slashing everywhere. Yes, Dark Souls is skill-based. You'll have to get used on using the roll, heavy slash, light slash, shields, bows, utiliteies, etc. if you want to be able to progress through the game. They are not easy at all to master.DisadvantagesStoryline is confusing. It's best not to put your hope on the story-driven part. The game lacks explanation about the previous installment stories. You can always look at YouTube to catch up with the stories but IMHO, it's not a nicely written story. It's short, lacks details, lacks plot twists, and it's just way too 'mainstream and predictable'. As for the soundtrack, it's empty as usual. I expected epic songs for these kinds of games but apparently, they still think almost-no-soundtracks is good. The overwhelming difficulty itself is NOT a disdvantage - it is purely based on your gaming style preference. The second noticable disadvantage is the lack of new weapons in the shops. I may not have progressed far but when I meet a 'checkpoint', I couldn't find anything useful in there. I might have to enchant weapons and all but I haven't quite understood the mechanism. Should it be a disadvantage? I don't know. I might be too stupid to understand the whole mechanism in 5 hours or maybe the game itself lacks tutorials for new players that are not familiar with Dark Souls.Final VerdictIt all depends on your gaming preference. Some people enjoy Dark Souls, some people don't. Make sure you look at the gameplay first on YouTube or whatever before purchasing this game just to make sure you won't waste your money. I personally like this game and recommend it for everyone regardless of your gaming preference because everyone needs to be desensitized from failures. But you might think it's not necessary because you already have a super safe life and a tremendous amount of parent's money. Just make sure you watch the gameplay first before purchasing it.",1

If only the game had dedicated servers for pvp it would be perfect.,1
Positive,"Great game, very challenging at first but once you get hang of it, it becomes quite satisfying to outmaneuver bosses and any other NPC that's like a mini boss.It took me under 50 hours to beat the game but that's with whole exploring aspect, i really took time to explore each corner and find whatever i could stumble across around each corner. If you don't care about that, you could manage it way faster, as i even beat optional bosses but that for me is a big bonus and which i really liked about this game as this has so much variety. More stuff to do, more fun. There's still things i missed during my playthrough, which i have to go and finish that before i'll go into my Journey 2 game.About the story side, i still really don't know what it was about even though i beat the game, only some parts. Maybe it's because i haven't played DS1 and DS2? Don't know but all the cinematic i got from the game, even though it was very small portion, it still was really nice. It's not the story that got me interested anyway, but the gameplay.Overall, if you looking to buy this. You won't regret it, i didn't even notice hours pass by while playing this game. Even when i was irritated by losing over and over again, i was still always looking forward to advance to the next boss.",1
Positive,"Dark Souls 3 is my first Dark Souls (I have commited a sin for not playing the others I'm sorry)You will feel pain, you will cry, you will suffer, every time you die.The game has great combat and punishes you for your errors.

It also has a very unique atmosphere I've ever seen in games before and it's cool. The characters, the creatures you encounter, the boss fights, soundtrack,etc. It's a phenomenal game and to me I felt confident in playing through it after defeating the 1st boss. It just gives you satisfaction defeating large enemies for souls.I would definitely reccommend Dark Souls III whether you are a veteran (you probably have it already anyway) or new to the series like me.",1

Positive,"Well, well, well.I never loved this game before.I just wanted to buy a co-op game with my buddy, and he told me that this game will be a good choice.I said ""ok why not"".After a few hour, i felt i need to play more with this game. After a 10-15 hour, i felt that i need to complete this game.After i completed the game, i felt i need to complete this game again, and locate all the secrets and lore.After i completed the game twice, i felt that i need to buy the dlc's coz i didnt get enough from this game(from the positive side ofc).After this monologe you can realize that how much i love this game now.Just to be fair!Positive thing:- Wonderful graphics- Nice combat system- So many different enemies with different combat style- Epic boss battle's- Good lore- Great co-op experience (even if the co-op system is not working at all the time for me)- Very-very good rpg system- Beutiful musicThere is no negative. Maybe the only one, that you getting brain cancer sometimes, but thats it.Go fucking buy it!",1
Positive,"Dark Souls 3 is by far my favorite installment of the Dark Souls universe. Dark Souls 1 is obviously the pioneer of the saga and is the sole reason the series was a wild success(which is why it should have been remade like Demon Souls was instead of ""remastered""). Dark Souls 2 was the experimental aspect of the series allowing for more creative choices to be made with a rich world to explore. Ultimately it deviated too far from the nucleus of the Souls-Verse/game. However, Dark Souls 3 returns back to the roots of the first game (albeit with some alterations) while learning from the shortfalls of Dark Souls 2. What Dark Souls 3 becomes is arguably the best Dark Souls game for a multitude of reasons but mainly: story/lore/themes, gameplay (both single-player and pvp), and level design. In fact I would say that Dark Souls 3 is the best installment to ease new players into the series as it is more streamlined from all the learned lessons from From Software. Which is why I suggest a machete order to be 3,1,2. 3 eases them into the series, 1 punishes them/shows them their roots, 2 allows for more exploration of the universe. All of these games are great in their own right.",1
Positive,This has become by far my favorite game. The joy of finally killing a boss after countless tries is the greatest <3,1

Positive,"I've played through the trilogy two times before and this is my third time going through Dark Souls III. Everytime I replay, I learn something new, see something new and I get as excited every single time. This is a beautiful game with a big dark world to explore. I would highly recommend buying the whole trilogy and going through them from the start if this is your first time.Dark Souls is an immersive feeling than will take you on the journey of your life, filled with choices, challenges and rage.",1
Positive,"Dark Souls is back! From the initial cutscene you can just feel that it's gonna be more like Dark Souls and less like Dark Souls 2, which is a fantastic thing. It's faster than any Souls game before it, but not quite as fast as Bloodborne, making it it's own unique beast. The graphics are stunning and the game runs like an absolute dream on my machine, although I've heard a few people are experiencing crashes, so take my experience with a grain of salt. To me, it's 50% Dark Souls, 20% Bloodborne, 20% Demon's Souls and 10% Dark Souls 2. If that's how you'd rank the Souls Series, then you should definitely get Dark Souls 3, assuming you haven't already.",1
Positive,"I'm going to start and say, I love Demon's Souls, Dark Souls, and even Bloodborne. I recommend this game, I do.But this review addresses everything wrong with the game as a sequel. This is a review for fellow Souls fans.Dark Souls 3 is, straight up, the easiest Souls game created. Anyone can beat it. Even the most inept of players won't hit a wall, they'll eventually tear through it. The difficulty of this game pales in comparison to Demon's Souls, to Dark Souls, to Dark Souls 2, and to Bloodborne by a massive amount. It's possible even some casual players will find themselves never losing their souls to a second death.Many enemies, from across the series, come up as a huge wall to players. You learn their movements, and tear through them after putting in the time and work. Trying to work around them can even end in great disaster. The only enemy that really puts up a fight can be the Lotrhic Knights, but not because of their difficulty, because of their damage and that is all. They are defeated without effort: spamming light attacks will keep them staggered. And after that, there are no more hard enemies. Not one in the game. You are set on by nothing but hollows who sluggishly move, and the very rare semi-competent skeletons. Anything much harder. is solved by a gimmick.A giant worm that would otherwise be a horrible fight can be killed using a giant ballista. One of the bosses has a weapon specifically for him to kill him fairly quickly, much like the Storm Ruler from Demon's Souls. The hardest bosses (The Dancer, Champion Gundyr) are dispatched with not even well timed rolling and a few hits to their backside.But worse than that, the levels are not just short, but there's very few. and most are very, very bland. While Dark Souls 1 was applauded for having a fantastically designed map, all of it interconnected and much of it unique, Dark Souls 2 was somewhat more traditional though still had some connections but was given far more unique locations, such as mining operations, a lava flooded castle, a castle drowned in rain, a quiet lake littered with fireflies and glowing fauna, dark labs, dragon's nests, and then the DLC areas were astounding. Dark Souls 3 is purely linear and only about half the total size of Dark Souls 2, every area was more bland. A somewhat interesting cemetery, a bland not-so-special castle aside from hollows who could only half way become pilgrim butterflies, bland forest with set pieces from DS1 for nostalgia, dull catacombs, a completely dull poison swamp, a lousy prison, a boring revist of Oolacile, a mostly uninteresting library. The most interesting areas of Dark Souls 3 are far from unique, capturing very little of the creativity of DS1 and DS2 with areas like Blighttown, the Painted World of Ariamas, New Londo Ruins, The Gutter, Majula, Shrine of Amana, Dark Chasm of Old, Brume Tower, Eleum Loyce. This isn't even half of the unique locales that were indeed quite enjoyable to look at, and the most unique location Dark Souls 3 has to offer is Kiln of the First Flame, an area that takes all of fifteen seconds to cross.And part of the world is the characters. While Greirat and Siegward are at least nice to talk to, everyone else is all but forgettable, and you rarely see them still. You don't talk to and regret meeting Lautrec, you don't feel as if you're following along on a grand journey like you did with Solaire (though you do stumble into Siegward just like before), you don't meet a character who asks you to kill -everyone- else, you don't meet some old king who tells you all of his regrets. You just meet people who are interested in selling stuff to you, and the obligatory Patches encounter.And then there's weapon balance. Much like other games, some weapons are better than others, but this time around, some weapons are leagues better than others compounded by the fact Poise is purely a disabled stat this time around (read again if you need to, Poise does nothing in Dark Souls 3 and has been confirmed as intentional). The Dark Sword, for instance, is a low weight of 4.5, and does a damage per second that completely outclasses nearly every weapon in the game with the correct build. The Spiked Mace can be built in a way that it will one shot players without any sort of parry. And Tower Shields are practically impossible to counter in PvP, and can attack while blocking far more effectively than a spear and shield torgether would be.On top of the poor weapon balance and Poise removed, invading players are at an extreme disadvantage: with reduced health, halved Estus rounded down, and primarily only invading players with phantoms, each invasion results in one of a few ways: the invader gets greedy and goes to them, and gets stuck fighting two players at once, the invader sits and waits by monsters for the next half hour because the host is too afraid for the odds to be evened despite still having more Estus, the invader finds a gank squad just for killing players already at a disadvantage, or the host doesn't know what they're doing and just runs out wildly and gets himself killed not even by you but some accident or monster.Or, if you're particularly unlucky, you'll run into a hacker. They take far less damage than they should at their level? They're modded their stats to be much higher without raising their level. They kill you in one hit? A hacker. There is even the ability to turn completely invisible, or fly, alter weapons to work how they want. This is nothing new to Souls, oh no. In DS1, hackers had the ability to instantly curse others with one hit of their weapon, even crash their game or rapid fire Firebombs. This time around, hackers can actually hit you with something that rapidly gives you souls and gets you, the invader, or even the host, banned out of nowhere. The solution to this: manual save backups because there are no cloud saves. The only solution currently. And the hacker problem is much worse than DS2, as Soul Memory made it hard to peg down for hackers where to be in that total to appropriately fuck over others. but could get banned if they had more souls than soul memory as a counter.In short: Dark Souls 3 is the worst game of the Souls series. While people ripped on DS2 for a long time being worse than DS1, DS3 is worse than DS2 by a long shot in size, balance, quality of level design, PvP, and most importantly, difficulty.It's just too damn easy.",1
Positive,"Three hours in, already rage quit, I'll come back after I've calmed down and a bottle of tequila. 11/10",1
Positive,"I spent my time playing the game and forgot to review it. Welp.For non-fans: If you want to get into the souls games, this isn't a bad place to start, as much as I'd like to say start with Demon's Souls or Dark Souls. Dark Souls 3 is a more accessible title and if you think it's your jam in the first two hours, it's probably going to be your jam for the next 300 hours. So, I am a longtime Souls fan. I love these games more than I should. I love the lore, the world-building, the combat, the ambience, the chracters, the story delivery, the bosses, etc. My opinion is biased. However, maybe not the way it would seem. On the first week of release, I f**king Hated this game. It was boring, easy, and the lore was redundant, or so it seemed. I was obviously awstruck by some events. (I would name them but fans who've yet to play this one will kill me.however, at this point, what souls nerd hasn't played 3?) It took about a month long break after my second time beating it for me to really appreciate it. The first time was on ps4 in which some bosses seemed to have the awesome ability of tanking your framerate. I did complete it, though. Then again on pc. I had hoped it would spark an interest but it didn't. And then I started connecting the game with the previous game(s) (honestly, just DkS 1 because Miyazaki seems to want to forget DkS 2) and then, only then, did my love respark. The Gameplay: It's basically the same as Dark Souls but with omni-directional rolling and weapon arts that diversify your movesets and increase the already skyscraper level skill cap. I don't have any complaints.The Bosses: So, I am biased here. Dark Souls was a game basically about you killing gods. It was so satisfying. In Dark Souls 3, you're killing lords; previous kindlers of the flame. The whole idea is awesome but it does show in the scale of some of the boss fights. Some are far easier than I would like. Luckily, From noticed this and have since then upped the HP of some of the fights to make them feel more challenging or to elongate some very fun fights. (The Dancer needed it and I love her again) Favorite in the game; Pontiff Sulyvahn/ Nameless King. Level Design: Some areas are just fantastically designed. Some stand-outs for me are Lothric Castle, the ever amazing Untended Graves and The-Place-That-Shan't-Be-Named because it's so f**king cool to get there. Unfortunately, there are places that just aren't nearly as interesting such as the Crucifixion Woods and Farron Keep. The game as a whole never quite reaches Bloodborne levels of wonderful level design but it gets quite close. The areas don't diversify in as much of an interesting way as they did in Dark Souls but far more than Bloodborne. The Lore: Wonderful. If you were a fan of Dark Souls lore, you will love digging into DkS 3's lore. Conclusion: It doesn't feel as special as Dark Souls at times but you have to take it as a place in the series. It does well to be the true successor to Dark Souls. It really is the Dark Souls II that we (mainly me) truly were hoping for.",1
Positive,"This game is having me hooked, i was a huge DS1 fan with alot of play thrus and DS3 is definetly amazing aswell. I bought it 4 weeks ago and have almost 100 hours already.",1
Positive,"Oh Dark Souls 3, you are generally a joy to play. The mechanics are good. Punishing you for playing poorly and rewarding you for playing well. The difficulty scaling is decent (Despite the DLC making the final boss feel like a victory lap). And the DLC itself is very fun! I had so many moments going through the game where it surprised me, in both good and ""bad"" ways. Now onto the Pros and Cons:Things Dark Souls 3 Got Right:Just difficult enoughBoss VarietyEnemy VarietyMap Zone VarietyTeleportation To Any BondfireInteresting NPCs and Unique Quest-linesSecret BossesSecret Covenants Easy Co-Op Password (Joining a friend is extremely easy in this game, as it should be)Things I wish were in Dark Souls 3:More weapons for each weapon type (I played majority of the game with a scythe, but there weren't many scythes to choose from)Secret Boss Weapons (Tail Weapons/Limb Weapons)DS2's NG+ Bond Fire Mechanic (Its one of the few things DS2 did right)Make certain NPCs easier to find, I very easily ran past a few of them (very minor gripe)Armor with unique mechanics/effects and variety in stats. (DS3 feels somewhat fashion souls-y)Final Boss Scaling in accordance with completion of the DLC (After the DLC bosses, the ""Final"" Boss was slapped down within 2-3 minutes, maybe even less.)Most of the gripes I have with DS3 can be summed up with me saying ""Man this game is great but I would love more [BLANK]"". With that being said, I'm somewhat sad to have gotten through Dark Souls 3 as quickly as I have (it could be related to running through all of the FromSoft games back to back). However, NG+ is also a part of DS3 that I know I'll be doing for another play-through.If this is your first Souls game, I would highly recommend it! It is fun, accessible, and polished. If you are a fan of the Souls series already, this game is a large improvement over DS2, and a great send off for Dark Souls!",1

Positive,"[Do Mind my English iz badzor]9/10 , I would rate this game 10/10 if it wasn't for the PC issue Me and others players having issue with.The game is fantastic, better that DS1/DS2 IMHO. At first I thought this game will be just like DS2, I look at the trailer and I saw the graphic doesn't seem improve from DS2 (yes i like seeing Graphic lel) but that was just my eyes problem, after I take alook again, It remind me of Bloodborn. Maybe DS3 inspired from bloodborn? who knows but I'am happy with new animation and new graphic looking :DThe gameplay is amazingly done, I don't have any problem so far with the battle mechanic like bugs.Now let's talk about the issues that me and other PC user having problem with. For some reason I cannot turn everything max setting (my PC can handle ultra setting for GTA5 and other games I have on steam and non steam such as BF4, Star Wars battlefront etc) So its Impossible for me not to run this game max setting. I had to turn off Lighting and motion blur. Everytime I turn my lighting on, my game would freeze, most of the time it will crashed my pc! GG!But after you turn down your lighting setting to Low, It should fixed the crashing. I'am not sure with other PC user, they say they crashed when they were nearby first bonfire, some crashed at start up. Bandai/Software give us patch NOW! So far the game succesfully makes me angry with few bosses and MINI Bosses! dafuq xD. For me, this game is harder than DS1/DS2. Do I recomend to buy this game? yup! GIVE EM MONEH! lol jk but yeah I enjoyed alot!",1
Positive,"Dark Souls III is the third title of the Dark Souls trilogy, it is as well made as the previous ones, while also enhancing a lot of aspects from the series. It maintains the dark gothic fantasy thematics which encompass the whole soulslike concept and it actually incorporates that more deeply in the storyline and the appearance of the characters and regions. The combat mechanics are the same with the rest of the soulslike titles, the regions are well designed and have become easier to navigate, while the teleportation system with the bonfires is also more friendly. The customization has also been expanded, with more hairstyles and other details. One unique aspect of Dark Souls 3 which makes it special is the iconic Fire Keeper maiden with the silver hair which became kind of a cultural icon and also one of the main symbols of the soulslike concept, as she is imagined to be awaiting in the bonfire and works as the guidance.",1
Positive,honestly i almost never bought this but im glad i did worth every penny. the community is very nice too suprisingly,1
Positive,"Easier than previous games(probably because i'm acustommed to it by now), PvP needs some fine tuning, best covenants ever, great design and sound, probably the best story out of all 3.",1
Positive,"9/10The good:no more Soul Memory from DS2 and the game follows the Soul Level system from DS1;multiplayer matching is seamless and now incorporates weapon upgrade tiers;closure to the many memorable characters from DS1; (Yes, this includes Gwyn's First Born)most of the maps are well designed. A few do feel like it's dragging the game on but luckily they ain't big maps;music, environment and atmosphere are wonderful as usual;four different endings (be sure to check out the secret ending as it's probably the canon one);you can respec your characters up to five times per playthrough;four ring slots (upgraded from two ring slots in previous entries).The bad:ranking up Covenants feel like grinding. Some of them are actually faster to grind offline. The Rank 2 Covenant rewards are pretty niche. You might still want to level up your Covenants for achievement;Luck stat seems like an after thought;Faith build is a bit OP but you can prepare for it;each boss has some weakness you can exploit (which is fine). But some bosses (including the DLC bosses) could die ridiculously easy if you exploit their weakness in a certain way;The ugly:bugs. Sometimes you can't enter fog door as helper phantom;final boss to Soul series. It's fitting but it's not to everyone's liking. YMMV;spell casting in general is not as good as melee. Consider mixing some melee into your mage build;ganking, hackers, etc;what happens to Dragon Form?Bottom line:as at the time of the writing, you can probably buy the game with DLC for $15-20. The content is well worth the price;if you are new to Soul series, it may actually not such a bad idea to play DS3 as your first Soul game. If you do, consider DS1 to be the prequel. This way you will appreciate DS3 more. There are a few ties in to DS2 but you can always read about them;I still rank DS1 higher than DS3, but DS3 is definitely the more polished game.",1
Positive,It's a pretty good game to try.,1
Positive,"Dark Souls at it's finest.This is the best game From Software has put out to date. They've improved the mechanics from the other Souls games to create a more fluid, visceral combat by taking pages out of their Bloodborne playbook. The level design and locales are better designed than ever before. There's a lot less ""artificial difficulty"" in this game when compared to previous games. Almost everything in the game can be countered with skill, even if unexpected. Not nearly as many treacherous ledges, or enemies hiding somewhere you cannot see them no matter how much you turn the camera, while they wait to strike and one-shot you. Don't get me wrong, these things still happen. Just not as much. Art direction is superb, and the atmosphere is wonderful. I really like the boss fights as well. Not many gimmick fights. Just one, really. Cons for this game are pretty limited. Camera does the player a disservice in some instances, but it's probably intentional. Music is not nearly as engaging as previous entries, but I suppose that's not necessarily a bad thing to some, even if it all sounds relatively alike. The plot is still mostly non-existant, and hidden behind a few sentences on some items that you may or may not find as you progress. It's taken three full games (two really, since they mostly ignore DS2) to build up to a half-formed idea of a story. What's there is pretty cool, but even with what's given crafting some idea of the story will only lead you with half answers or ideas, and you're often left filling in blanks with whatever you come up with in your head. On PC, the online is bad. There are a lot of cheaters out there now. Wasn't the case when I started playing, but it's only getting worse, so beware. Honestly though, I feel like those complaints aren't really a big deal, outside of the MP. The story is very obviously an afterthought, as it's not a story driven game. The camera doesn't bug me so much because it's pretty rare for it to really get bad, and these games are mostly trial and error anyway. The music I had to listen to after I played the game on the soundtrack, because I was so engrossed in the experience I couldn't even think of the tunes. It's a very finely crafted game, and I think everyone should give it a go, and not be discouraged by dying here and there.It earns a very hearty recommendation from me.",1

Negative,"Love the Dark Souls series. Love this game. Lots of great challenges, loads of good lore, lots of good times on multiplayer. Why am I leaving a negative review? Hackers have ruined the online experience. And for me, online play is a huge appeal in these games. But after years of playing and over 100 hours logged, a single hacker throwing hacked items into my inventory has banned me from online play. Nevermind the fact that I hit alt-f4 immediately after I saw this happening. Nevermind the fact that I loaded a backup save from before I even encountered the hacker. No. Bandai doesn't give a shit. A hacked item touched my account for 1 second. Now I'm deemed a turbo-hacker in Bandai's eyes and I can't play with my friends, which is why I came back to this game in the first place.I will change my review if and when Bandai decides to not punish players who make active strides to circumvent the efforts of hackers and want to play the game legitimately.",0
Negative,"You know the drill. Dark Souls 3 single-player is great and worth price of admission alone. Contrary to the memes, the game is not that difficult. It s true!Then why the negative review, you ask? Because Dark Soul 3 s thoroughly lacking net code for online play is extremely dangerous. At the time of writing, at least two different unpatched Remote Code Execution (RCE) exploits in Dark Souls 3[duckduckgo.com] have been found. RCE exploits allow bad actors to execute arbitrary code on a player s PC remotely. RCE exploits are the Dark Souls of cyber security. I cannot understate the severity of this. And Dark Souls 3, when connected to online multiplayer, leaves your system wide open.The first RCE exploit, found and detailed in April 2021, has persisted for almost a year without any reaction from Bandai Namco & FromSoftware. It fell on the community to provide unofficial anti-cheat software (entitled Blue Sentinels )[www.nexusmods.com] to protect Dark Souls 3 players from malicious actors online.The second RCE exploit was made public in January 2022 by members of the Dark Souls community. (The exploit had already been previously reported to Bandai Namco & FromSoftware in December 2021[www.fanbyte.com].) As of today (2022-02-09) online play in FromSoftware s Souls games (DS, DS2, DS3) has been disabled for more than two weeks[www.theverge.com] following a public demonstration of this second RCE exploit on twitch[clips.twitch.tv], ostensibly to mitigate risk and give FromSoftware time to fix the issue before the launch of ELDEN RING (2022), which is assumed to share a considerable part of its net code with the older games. The fact that the revelation of the first RCE exploit last year did not warrant an immediate and coordinated response from Bandai Namco & FromSoftware is frankly unacceptable. Adding insult to injury, it took a second RCE exploit and the resulting financial risk of it torpedoing the launch of their highly anticipated next title to actually spur Bandai Namco & FromSoftware into action. Needless to say, this is extremely irresponsible behaviour by a software firm selling its product to millions of customers. The only silver lining is that the temporary take-down of online functionality at least mitigates the present security risks. A much belated software patch to fix the exploits might be incoming.Buyers beware.",0

Here in Brazil, this game is actually more expensive than Elden Ring (and there wasn't a single instance where they put this game on sale during the entirety of 2022, check SteamDB),. A complete joke by NAMCO. If you want this game, try to find another store to buy the key, I'm pretty sure they're way cheaper than through Steam.EDIT (July 30th 2023): They lowered the price a little bit, now it's costing the same as Elden Ring.

On a more serious note: Beautiful scenery with a bittersweet ""story"", rewarding combat and adrenaline inducing fights. This game keeps dragging me back in, play through after play through.

A hacker happen to join into your game. they can do weird stuff like force adding stats, forcing items into your characters and mess up your save files and you'll be ban and burn in hell for it. and there are many hackers out there. game will force you to delete your savefiles. all those time you invest into leveling will be gone. If you wanna buy this game to experience online PVP coop. you have to accept that you risk lose your characters and all your sht at anytime. all those hours, days, weeks invested, gone. its really frustrate. its a great game tho if you wanna buy it and dont care much about pvp and just wanna enjoy sp story. but you have been warned.",0
Negative,Can't co-op. Fix servers pls.,0
Negative,"3-30-22 i'm still unable to access the the online game server, and I suspect they think this issue is resolved, it is not. Do not purchase this game for download until they finally get off their ass and fix it for everyone. In addition, they conveniently leave out the fact that your save files will not go to the cloud, soyou will not find out until after the fact when you have a PC issue that requires reinstalling your operating system like I did, stupid me for not taking an image, but f*ck you for wiping out 464 hour of gameplay.",0
Negative,"The point of this review is to point out the flaws and problems with the game. To help people make an informed decision before buying the game. You should always read multiple reviews, not just one. It's with a heavy heart that I write this review. It is of course my personal opinion. As a player with several thousand hours between Demons souls, Dark souls on PS3 and PC, Dark souls 2 on PS3 aswell as on pc, Dark souls 2: SotFS on pc, and Bloodborne on PS4, I feel I am obligated to write this. For the record, this review will change if the current state of the game improves, but as it stands, the game is not worth buying. While yes, it is a souls game, it is in a poor state. I'll first start by saying that I never played the japanese version, even though it released almost 3 weeks early there. That of course would allow for some sense of reassurance that many of the major issues with networking and balancing would be sorted out by the time of full release. Unfortunately, that's not the case. When the game fully released, the first area of the game after getting to the main hub was in essense broken. For whatever reason, the game made it almost impossible for a lot of people to see summon signs of friends while using the password system. The system that is supposed to make sure that those summon signs were the only ones visible to you and your friends. However, without a password, tons of signs were easily visible. Even if they were useless in the sense that 70% of summon attempts would simply fail and say ""unable to summon phantom"". So, 3 weeks early and the networking for the first area doesn't even work properly. Alright, moving on to the next area, summon signs without passwords still refused to work on a regular basis, and STILL DO at the time of my writing this. However, passworded signs would show up. This brings me to the next glaring issue, there are multiple covenants in the game that are dependant on automatically being summoned for an area to defend it or to defend a player who is already invaded. These covenants were next to useless when the game released as they would never send you to defend the area associated with your covenant. Thus making it that much harder to aquire the covenants items required to rank up to aquire certain spells and rings that are necessary for the acheivements. Unless you want to farm trash mobs for an hour+ to get your covenants drops. That's right, FromSoft was kind enough to add a method of grinding for the covenants that negates even needing to use them. Seems to me they knew that their networking was so broken that they made sure to add an offline method of doing covenants. Before anyone says, ""Well they put it there so people can play offline and still do all the covenants and such."" I doubt that someone so concerned with collecting all the items and such would play offline. Another interesting thing, is that the armor stat ""Poise"" (it's in armor pieces stat pages, on the character stat page and there's a ring dedicated to boosting poise) is turned off in the config files for players. However, NPC's still have it. It essentially makes actual defense stats more important than anything. Unless you use certain heavy weapons that have infinite poise while using a light attack. It makes trading with heavy weapons an impossibility if you're playing PvP as hitting them before their attack connects does not stun them and leaves you completely open for a full hit, which WILL stun you and give them a free second hit before you're able to roll away. And again, before anyone says ""git gud"", keep in mind I typically keep my builds lightweight and even use the carthus bloodring to improve my i-frames while dodging. Not being able to interrupt someone simply because their weapon is bigger and happens to give them hyper armor while swinging puts myself at a major disadvantage regardless of any factors. What else. Oh, the mind numbing difficulty of the game. I'm kidding of course. As far as souls games go, Dark souls 3, is objectively the easiest and most forgiving. Not only are most of the larger, tougher enemies either stun lockable with the help of a phantom, but the larger ones can be viceral attacked after connecting a few hits on them, usually killing them. Also, the difference between New Game and NG+ is negligable. I've completely the game 4 times already, both NG and NG+ and have been horribly dissappointed with NG+. The enemies are hardly any tougher, as you're character is already fully geared by the time you get there and just getting more powerful. Not to mention the signature addition of random dark spirit invaders and red phantom versions of normal enemies that would appear in NG+ in previous games, all the way back to Demons Souls. It's not a new concept, and it kept NG+ fresh and exciting. The ONLY thing to look forward to in NG+ over NG in Dark souls 3 is +1 versions of rings. And I've heard that the only thing in NG++ is +2 rings. It's a massive disappointment for more hardcore players like myself that liked the added challenge of turning a corner and running into a skeleton or hollow on steroids that hits twice as hard. It takes a lot of the hardcore ""YOU WILL DIE"" mentality that's been a trademark for souls games away and instead changed it to ""YOU WILL FARM"". I suppose another small thing to note is that large portions of the game feel highly unpolished and rushed. Some areas are breathtakingly beautiful, while others are full of large portions of texture and mesh completely missing, leading to literal holes in the world. Not to mention the weird graphical errors people get where everything goes wire mesh and turns bright shades of purple and green. Or players body texture clipping through armor when you hold a specific type of weapon as a specific gender. Or the fact that on full release, bonfires were one of the most dangerous things in the game, as they would cause a graphics driver kernel crash if you're lighting setting in the options menu was set to anything above low. A real kick in the ribs to players with high end pc's capable of running the game at max settings but being forced to tweak on setting to avoid crashes. Or the fact that after shutting down the game and restarting it, the game had a tendancy to reset the lighting setting to the recommended, detected setting without your knowing, causing crashes that you thought you'd fixed. Another thing of note, is that the game runs like trash on console. It does not play at an acceptable framerate on PS4 compared to pc. Looking at one, then the other, the difference is almost physically sickening. As stated above, this is my personal opinion, and this review is subject to being edited if the game sees improvement. I wish I could recommend it, but I simply can't, and it pains me to say that. I hope you found something useful or helpful in my review before making a purchase. Have a nice day.",0

Negative,"A game that I went into expecting to hate and was pleasantly surprised. Dark Souls 3 is fantastic, but unfortunately at the moment I cannot recommend it because of the utterly broken anti-cheat system.Cheaters are currently able to (and quite easily so) get innocent players permanently banned, as well as forcibly modifying stats, wiping inventories, etc. As a result, the online is unplayable for anyone who doesn't want to risk having their save ruined and get permanently banned from the online as a result. As time goes on, cheaters doing this will get more and more common, until the entire community dies off. Until Fromsoft/Namco Bandai does something to remedy the situation, I cannot recommend this game, especially not at full price.",0
Negative,"Dont mistake my negative review for disliking the game, I personally think the game is fantastic. However a remote code execution exploit (or RCE for short) has been discovered in the games netcode effectively making the game a virus for anyone who plays it online. This exploit allows anyone who invades your game or someone you summon to run code on your computer without your consent. This exploit can be used to simply crash someones game, or open up random programs on the users computer, steal private information, or even brick your PC.The community managed mod/anti-cheat Blue Sentinel has patched out the exploit and it is highly encouraged that you install the mod before playing the game. I have linked the mod below for convenience. https://www.nexusmods.com/darksouls3/mods/723While im thankful for the effort of the developers behind the Blue Sentinel mod and their speedy response in fixing the exploit, the community should not be responsible for making sure a product works and is safe for its user base this responsibility should fall on the developers and the publishers. I hope to see an official response from either Bandai Namco or Fromsoftware soon addressing the issue and insuring us this issue will not be present in the upcoming Elden Ring. Until then i cannot safely recommend a game that has the potential to harm your PC.",0
Negative,"An amazing game everyone should play at least once, but play offline, I'd rather eat broken glass than play the awful PvP system again, the starter areas are filled with individuals that use high-end gear to farm new players, usually putting them off the game permanently, it sucks. Oh, and don't forget the hackers. I've had some good experiences with the community, and I've also done what I can to add to that group, invading and giving people embers etc for free. However, good experiences online here are few and far between, avoid it like the plague and weep because we're definitely not getting any kind of private co-op mode for you to show your friends how great this game is without xX_NewbpWnAgE42069(InsertEdgyClanName)_Xx or 'shreklolXDXD' invading with a dark hand and caestus.Edit: 'You suck' and 'casul' is not a valid argument, especially when it takes no skill to stack buffs, equipment and stats for low SL invasion easy-mode time. I think you're a sad basement dweller if you feel the little endorphin high you get from winning an invasion matters in life, but the thing is, if you exploit new players for covenant items, YOU suck, not me.Edit edit: I believe in criticism quite wholeheartedly, but I'm also not very good with being spammed dumb insults in the comments section (although more depressing to read than good as insults). I thought I'd be able to handle that better, but it's just not something I am decent at it seems, which is sad because I really didn't want to disable the comments. Considered deleting the review but I think it's important to keep up as a little message on how idiots are ruining the online experience of a game that is otherwise what I'd consider the most immersive and fascinating fantasy universe ever written. Haven't received any constructive criticism to warrant keeping comments enabled, so, I'm sorry, I have anxiety, and not self-diagnosed, I gotta disable them so I'm not worrying about what's being said here 24/7 and tempted to reply to every 'git gud' or 'casul' comment.",0

The base game is fantastic with a few balance issues and optimization issues that I would normally recommend to people. However there is a lingering fear that should you continue playing this game online that you will someday be flagged or worse, soft banned while playing legitimately and until that is no longer an issue I will keep this a negative review.",0
Negative,"A dangerous remote code execution (RCE) exploit found in Dark Souls 3 could let a bad actor take control of your computer, according to a report from Dexerto. The vulnerability only puts PC gamers who play online at risk and may potentially affect Dark Souls, Dark Souls 2, and the upcoming Elden Ring. Servers for various Dark Souls games have since been shut down in response.The exploit was seen in action during The_Grim_Sleeper s Twitch stream of Dark Souls 3 online. At the end of the stream (1:20:22), The_Grim_Sleeper s game crashes, and the robotic voice belonging to Microsoft s text-to-speech generator suddenly starts criticizing his gameplay. The_Grim_Sleeper then reports that Microsoft PowerShell opened by itself, a sign that a hacker used the program to run a script that triggered the text-to-speech feature.RCE IS ONE OF THE MOST DANGEROUS VULNERABILITIESHowever, this likely wasn t a malicious hacker a screenshotted post on the SpeedSouls Discord may reveal the hacker s actual intentions. According to the post, the hacker knew about the vulnerability and attempted to contact Dark Souls developer FromSoftware about the issue. He was reportedly ignored, so he started using the hack on streamers to draw attention to the problem.But if a bad actor discovered this problem first, the outcome could ve been much worse. RCE is one of the most dangerous vulnerabilities, as noted by Kaspersky. It allows hackers to run malicious code on their victim s computer, causing irreparable damage, and potentially stealing sensitive information while they re at it.Blue Sentinel, a community-made anti-cheat mod for Dark Souls 3, has since been patched to protect against the RCE vulnerability. In a post on the r/darksouls3 subreddit, a user explains that (hopefully) only four people know how to execute the RCE hack two of which are Blue Sentinel developers, and the other two are people who worked on it, possibly referring to the individuals who helped uncover the issue.A representative for Bandai Namco, Dark Souls publisher, commented on a Reddit post in response to the issue, stating: Thanks very much for the ping, a report on this topic was submitted to the relevant internal teams earlier today, the information is much appreciated! The Verge reached out to Bandai Namco with a request for comment but didn t immediately hear back. I recommend to download the blue sentinel mod, report this to the software devs, don't recommend dark souls to anyone and don't pre purchase Elden ring until Software takes this situation seriously.",0
Negative,"Good game, but is PLAGUED with hackers that teleport, force instant death animations, prevent you from using separation crystal (forcing you to force close the game) and in other cases completely wiping ALL of your progress That's right, a hacker can invade you and simply erase countless hours of progress from your character. They can also force actions on your character that makes the game detect you as a cheater, penalizing you and BANNING you from online forever even though you didn't do anything. While this hasn't happened to me there are plenty of cases of it happening. I cannot recommend the game until this is handled properly by FromSoftware.

One word:HACKERS.The game is full of hackers using teleport, being impossible to touch (but they can heal their friends or kill you), players that insta kill you or put items in your inventory that will be detected as hacking and you'll get banned.So until the hacker problem is taken care of and permabans start happening, the game is not worth it.There are also other problems that make the game not worthwile if you plan to play online:LAGIt's unbearable.

Negative,"This is a fantastic game that I would recommend to everyone, if not for one thing:The state of online play. The game is plagued by hackers, capable of not only instantly killing other players, but corrupting their game files, or getting them banned by inserting invalid data into their account. With the ability to invade another player's game, encountering these cheaters isn't even something you have control over.

Negative,"This game is a very fun game, and I loved every second of it. However, FROM SOFT has ruined the game for me. 1. Softbaning. According to the anti-cheat software shoving its head up its ass I, and many, many other players, have been softbanned for no reason. CO-OP does not really exist for me any more, and apparently the invaders have given up on trying to get me as well. I'm basically playing a single player version of a multiplayer game because of some formatting error. On top of all that I deleted my main character because I thought it would fix the error message. So there goes 30 hours of my time, FROM, I hope you're happy. 2. Glitches. This game is riddled with glitches. Some of them allow enemies and other creatures to hop around the screen and attack you at lighning speed in seconds. It was not a framerate issue, it just happened for me. My game would sometimes give me delayed responces as well. Sometimes I would try to roll, but it would not happen. I did the most logical thing and tried to roll again, and I just ended up rolling twice. It was NOT a framerate issue. 3. Online Play. I'm not going to lie. My internet connection is not the best, but I get a decient ammount of bandwith that I have little to no trouble with playing other games in multiplayer mode. Most of, if not all, the games that I invaded orwas summoned into had Lagasaurous-Rex teir lag. Players would SLIDE across the screen in their idle position whilst making damaged gasps and attacking sounds. Enemies and BOSSES would revert to these stances whenever my host was attacked by them. It was incredably easy for me to backstab every enemy due to the extreme lag on FROM's servers. The worst part was the invaders and the bosses. Invaders would do the same thing as the host while attacking in their idle position. invasions turned into a spam fest because no one could tell what the others were doing. When bosses became like this I could not be damaged. I don't know if it was the fact that the boss was nowhere near me due to lag or the fact that an animation had to hit me to damage me. I don't know. However, the fact that this happened is outrageous for a game. Conclusion. Don't buy this game until it has been fixxed. Otherwise you may be banned for no reason, thus limiting the game, become frusterated when glitches ruin your fun, and generally become confused when everyone is in their freaking idle position.",0

Negative,"Great game just a real shame that hackers can force hacked items into your inventory thus getting you banned with no warning and no hope of getting it undone. Now this was already an issue and has been pretty much the whole lifetime of the game but recently Fromsoft/Namco Bandai removed the family and friends sharing option which was the only real defence you had for not getting your legit copy banned by sharing the game and playing it through a separate account so when/if you get banned though a third party acting maliciously you could still play the game as intended. (though it would normally cost you the current save as well up until your last manual backup assuming you though far enough ahead to manually back up your saves for an online game . . . )This only really harms legit players as hackers were already getting around the item checks and ban waves anyway and have been for a long time.Also, this means that anyone using legit mods (as in mods not made for cheating in PvP but changing the game itself adding more challenge e.c.t) now has a choice of playing the vanilla game as intended or using mods and catching a ban for doing so.This was a poor choice and really makes me think less of Fromsoft/Namco Bandai and makes me wonder if they will pull stuff like this further down the line with things like Elden ring.",0

This third (and supposed to be the last souls ever) boost overall what has been done in the past, for me at least raising the bar for fans and newcommers alike. Many will buy this game not fully getting that's basically a hardcore game, pretty much old school in the way that is meant to reward you for your hard efford, the game have 1 set difficulty and you will have to struggle, maybe coop with friends and try countless times until you get the grip of it, eventually you'll understand the mechanic of the game and you will die in ocations but in the end this is a really amazing journey within a story that i still don't fully understand, before i forget this is an Action RPG game, third person and for new ppl this is NOT something to take it lightly.First steps: At first when you start to understand what's an unkindled, a hallow, a lord of cinder, you will start playing a souls game, you will admire beautiful landscapes, amazing scenes while playing and cutscenes that are really well made until you get frustrated by being killed by any single enemy alone in the game, yet with perseverance comes strenght, you will succed if you keep trying, you will see the amazing many places this game have (tho linear, really restricted) and the amazing bosses and INCREDIBLE soundtrack, the gameplay for me was made to use a controller rather that the keyboard but that's up to you and one final thing, optimization has been done really good but the game's frames drops sometimes so it would be nice a patch to adress those issues.Final note: i have so much to say about the souls games and this one in particular, i might update this review later, for me this game it's a bit expensive at the moment but if you're looking for a challange then this is a great game. I'm happy i've got this one.Metascore: 82/100 ""Give it a try, if you don't mind losing your souls, unkindled one :)""",0

There is a serious exploit making the rounds online that lets hackers mess up your save game really bad and Bamco and FromSoftware have been made aware of it a long time ago and they have chosen not to patch it.

Negative,"I actually very much enjoy this game and wish for many others to play it even now. The only reason I give it a thumbs down is because ""From Software"" neglects the PC players tremendously. There's hackers still in pvp that not only can use normal cheats, but crash your game through animation spamming that overloads your framerate and even WORSE than that. they can put items that are bannable into your inventory such as ""20 Storm Rulers"". No weapon goes beyond +10, so when you log in, the game detects ""unusual data"" and automatically bans you from being able to play. From Software has nothing to combat this and will take quite a while to unban you assuming you even have proof.Aside from that, PVP in this game, while fun. is kinda past its prime. Everyone's been playing this game for years already, the community agreed level cap of 120 goes overrated because people will new game plus and setup areas that are invaded frequently to become these ""fight clubs"". It gets really annoying being an Aldritch Faithful covenant member wanting to PVP when someone's in the territory, only to find out they cleared every mob and have 3 friends with them that were pre-summoned level 900+'s just looking for an easy gank. It kinda exploits the system and makes any genuine fun you'd get out of intentional designs, a bit hit and miss. I love invading and being invaded, but the system is very easily exploitable and not well designed.The story won't make sense at all, even if you've played the other 2 dark souls since every NPC's dialogue is cryptic and written with assumed context of you knowing what's even happening. You WILL spend mountains of time googling everything, from story to content you missed because it's very poorly explained. which is a good thing and bad thing imo. It creates a more genuine RPG feel but neglects the player's ability to understand or displays rather bad ""conveyance"". How are you supposed to know its your responsibility to do even half the things the NPC's say when half of them are just rambling about what you should do but are not actually capable of right?It's still a really fun game and I'll still be playing it, but From Software needs to take this down vote and realize they need to add anti-cheat software when it comes to PC games. Not only that but the balance in this game is. very questionable as the META ruins a LOT of pvp encounters you may have and even some of the PVE.Something to add. The playerbase is mostly toxic and meme based. Every name you come across is a meme, no one plays this game like an actual RPG, they just read it like a math exam and name themselves one of the following.""bruh""dude""Something Racist + word""Praise the Insert Meme here""dddddddddd""12345678""Cosplay as anime or character in game""I'm not much against the last one but damn after a while this just gives you an actual headache when you realize everyone treats this game like it's made specifically for memes. I miss when RPG's actually enveloped players and they were immersed in the environment they were in over being able to wave their shield button 90 times and throw dung to imply ur ""bad"".",0
Negative,why the fuck this game does not have a cloud system on saves.,0
Negative,"I have to say, genuinely, this is such a good game, and DS3 is the most quality version in PC platform.However, I hope I am not the only one who wants to critisie its file checking system, which results in so many true fans of DS3 got soft banned or even permenantly banned.Why? Because so many cheaters not only happy with editing their own files but also want to do so to others. They are able to use such as CE to craft a weapon which is not belong to the game, and this kind of weapon can achieve consequences like one-shot kill or 'back to level-1'. This very negative phenomenon causes many legal players banned by the system mentioned above when it identifies any 'invalid' date in their own files.What makes me even angry is, the game operators do not give a shit about it, especially for the customers in PC. They even stated that this is only our faults to 'play with' or 'recieve gifts from' thoes inappropiate players. However, could you plz tell me how can I avoid being invaded by these players? How can I know they are the ones? Someone might argue that YOU CAN JUST TRUN OFF THE ON-LINE PLAY OPTION. Yes, I can, if the online content is optional, I would rather ask a refund for castrating this content off.To sum up, if you really love this game and you like pvp and/or any other online game-plays, PC VERSION IS THE LAST OPTION.",0
Negative,This is a great game but the online dueling community is swarmed with hackers that will make your account get banned. I talked to support any they told me there is nothing they can do to unban my account because the main company is based in Japan. Very unfortunate that this amazing game is getting gutted by hackers on pc with no fix in site. If you must play this game I recommend offline but most of the content is made for online so you will feel lonely and like you are playing an incomplete game.Really hope Elden ring doesn't do the same auto ban system.Hackers are able to fill your character up with hacked items once you join their world. And even if you delete them right away you will still be flagged and banned.,0

Negative,"Honestly, I'm not a big fan of Dark Souls III. Truth be told, I kinda hate it. I'll say now that most of this is probably personal bias.To me, this game feels a lot more artifically harder than it needs to be. The lack of any hitstun from just wearing armour can be bloody unbearable sometimes, like when some tosser hits you with a knife and your guy staggers as if he just got hit by a bloody bomb while wearing full metal plated armour. And yeah, there are hyper frames when you swing with Great/Ultra Great weapons, I know.The melee combat is fine, obviously. It's a souls game, simple if you just boil it down to it's basics which would be ""press circle/b when bad man swings, press r1 to hit when bad man no swing"" just like the other games. The spell casting is different this time around, and I kinda enjoy it. It's probably one of the few reasons why I occasionally revisit this game. I find a fair amount of enjoyment rolling around a boss and throwing a massive orb of fire in their face, or slamming a lightning stake right into the feet whenever I get the moment to.The progression isn't too bad, I suppose? Upgrade Materials are fed out at a reasonable rate, though I dislike how rare infusion gems are. You get like what, one lightning gem the entire game unless you're willing to farm Lothric Knights? Good luck with that though. There doesn't seem to be many options early/mid game, either. The game might be a little rough early game if you pick a caster as a starting class, and dear lord pyromancer starts off with some awful stats which is fair enough I suppose since they also start off with pyromancy and high faith/int.The weapon arts are also new, kinda. Every weapon has some kinda gimmick attached to it that you can use when two handing, many straight swords have a Stance that allows you to break guards if you land the hit or close the distance with a lunge, some weapons can buff themselves, and some weapons have completely unique weapon arts. Weaponarts use FP, and to restore that you'll mostly be using Ashen Estus to restore that and you'll have to carefully balance what amount of Estus you convert into Ashen Estus to use both weapon arts and spells which is fair enough I suppose. Spells can demolish bosses pretty quick so you'll have to give up some healing to kill em with just spells, so carrying 20 soul spears and 20 estus (exaggeration, but still.)I don't really know what else to say, to be honest. It's a decent game I guess but I still kinda hate it. Maybe it's just not what I'd expect from a souls game or maybe I'm just awful. So maybe you'll like it, maybe you won't. Just keep in mind it is difficult at times and, in my opinion, it feels ""Hard"" for the sake of being ""Hard"" rather than challenging.And dear GOD the first DLC is bloody dreadful. It's short, some of the enemy encounters are just outright unfair and awful. DLC2 is. eh, I didn't like it. I suppose it's just more dark souls 3, really. Though it did have one boss I enjoyed, who was Gael. He's a pretty good fight and I had a lot of fun with that boss.",0
Negative,Fix the damn servers.,0
Negative,"Dark Souls 3 is a pretty decent single player game.The enemies are varied, the boss fights are engaging, the level design is great. I prefer Dark Souls 1 level design in particular, however, because teleporting was not an option until much later in the game; it made you feel like you were truly exploring the world, and everything was connected. Comparatively, you are now required to teleport to get to the first actual level in this game, and to subsequent levels. Teleporting was very seldom a requirement in Dark Souls 1.The way multiplayer/PVP is balanced is horrid.Sure, co-op with friends is good. Just as it always has been in the Souls series, when you look at the co-op aspect by itself. However there is a major problem. Now more than ever in this game series, invaders are urged to twink (at lower levels). Here's why: 99% of the time, invaders are matched with players who already have co-op phantoms in their world. Yes, the invading system favors hosts who already have their buddies with them, ready to gank your invading ass back to your world. Coupled with the covenant system where blue defenders can show up and gank you even harder, it's no wonder why invaders twink. They have to twink in order to win. And when these twink players invade a player and his friend who are playing normally, with no upgraded equipment and early-game gear, they become casualities to this idiotic system.When it comes to PVP at higher levels. Well, let's just say it's not fun. Since there is no poise as we're used to from DS1 (and to a lesser extent 2), and since shields are pretty useless except for a very small percentage, PVP is a roll-fest. Have full Havel's on? Prepare to get stunned by bare fists. You wanna use a shield below a greatshield? You better be ready to become a parry king through guesswork, or get shield broken and take repost damage. By the way, when it comes to armor, heavy and light are now not viable. The only truly optimal armor to wear is medium. It provides the best amount of defense in the game for the least amount of weight. Miyazaki got the title wrong, this should have been named Bloodborne 2.I say that because it's a game completely focused on dodging. You are encouraged to dodge, and that idea is exemplified by the fact that you basically have fast rolls until 70% weight ratio. Rolling is simply absurdly over powered and is essentially a core gameplay aspect. Regarding shields, all but greatshields are useless. All parry options now have a windup before the actual parrying window starts, and combined with the fact that attacks from enemies are much faster than in DS1, it's much harder to parry on reaction, if not impossible.Overall,I'd say if you want to play the newest Dark Souls game simply for the sake of it being a part of the Souls' series, do it. But if you're going to be playing, be prepared for what I have described.",0

Negative,"Dark Souls III is one of those few games that I love dearly, but can t recommend to everyone because of a number of different issues that bring the experience down. Fans of the series can possibly interpret my review as an overall positive experience, but new folks will need to consider the game more carefully. Hopefully, some of my gripes have already been addressed by developers. Let s begin with the performance.Dark Souls 3 continues the tradition of having areas that drop frames. It was a mostly stable 60fps experience for me, but dropping frames didn t do me any favors when I was carefully timing my movements. The frame drops weren t restricted to one area either. I had this problem over the entire course of the game. Some areas in the later portion of the game were really horrid. What also made me really sour was whenever I lost connection to their servers, I d be booted back to the title screen instead of just going into offline mode. I ve seen this happen during a boss fight. I also had a few crashes, but they were rare enough to not be a serious problem. Finally, I joined a significant number of other players worlds as a friendly phantom only to not be able to enter the boss s fog door. For reference, I am using a GTX 970 and an i7 4790K with 8 GBs of RAM and Windows 7.The combat in the game is very familiar if you ve played the previous games, but the weapon variety and weapon skills help spice things up. Wielding a weapon with both hands lets you use its weapon skill which can be anything from a special parry, firing three arrows rapidly, summoning lightning, having a new strong attack combo, a quickstep, or even giving yourself a temporary attack buff. Having more tools to handle a situation is a plus in my book and this game s implementation of it gives melee players an incentive to put the shield away. Weapon skills being available on every single weapon made combat feel much more entertaining, especially when the boss weapons have some of the boss techniques on them. I didn t engage much with spellcasting since I heard it required a lot of specialization. Pyromancy is still very accessible for characters, powerful, and looks great. The magic buffs in general are also well worth the effort to acquire for melee characters.However, the combat has significant flaws. Poise doesn t do what you would expect. Poise didn t keep me from being staggered by attacks and no matter how much poise I stacked, even the weakest hollows could stagger me without much effort. Because of how poise works in this game, heavy armor doesn t feel like it s protecting you as much since stun locks can still happen. I believe some spells and definitely some weapon skills can increase your poise to prevent stagger to allow uninterrupted attacks. For example, the Black Knight Sword has a skill called Perseverance which says Raise sword to temporarily boost poise. Damage reduced while activated. When this skill is used, you can avoid any staggering effects and attack without restraint. Notice how it says it s raising poise, yet any poise gained from any wearable equipment cannot avoid being staggered. They should have renamed the stat because of how confusing and misleading it is to have two different kinds of poise with very different effects. From what I read, regular poise has to do with vulnerability frames (not i-frames) with rolling. I suppose that s what they want from players, more rolling.The second major problem with combat is how the walls interact with players and enemies. You ll soon discover that as you try to attack through a solid object, you ll recoil from the impact. This recoil can occur when fighting near pillars or walls and makes sense when it happens. You don't have Kitty Pryde's phasing abilities. On the other hand, enemy attacks will ignore walls and strike you for full damage. I ve only seen enemy phantoms and two very large enemies recoil from trying to attack through walls or objects. One of those large enemies threw a chain axe through about 14 feet of wall and managed to hit me. There were far too many instances where enemies could attack through extremely thick walls or obstacles and still hurt you. I wanted tough, but fair, not this nonsense. I ve even seen some enemies shoot projectiles through walls. I don t understand why enemies are allowed to ignore solid matter to such a degree. I don t remember if the other games had this enemy behavior, but it s really obvious in this installment. At least the boss combat is pretty good.The boss fights in DSIII are very well paced and are much more memorable than DSII. There are less bosses which appears to have resulted in higher quality fights with unique and interesting movesets. The overly humanoid setup of DSII didn t make a comeback for this title. I enjoyed most of the fights and found myself pleasantly surprised at what the bosses brought to the table. Sometimes, the fights can change in a way that I ll not spoil here. I liked how they were designed, both mechanically and visually.Speaking of visuals, Dark Souls III is the best looking one in the series. It s a gorgeous game with gorgeous views. The environments also tie together pretty well. You can t exactly travel to all the places by foot, but if you can see it, you can probably go there. I greatly enjoyed how you can constantly see places that you ve been to in the background which gives a good sense of progress and where you are in the world. Seeing what s up ahead and thinking Oh man, do I get to go there too? is another thing that DSIII does very well. Here s an example of what I mean from very, very early in the game:I d also like to point out that there s no impossible elevator la Dark Souls II.Multiplayer is fairly pleasant, but From Software s approach to handling cheaters doesn t seem like the best approach, mostly because of how the innocent are soft-banned along with the guilty. Be sure to never, ever accept an item from a stranger, but unfortunately, sometimes that may not even be enough. In addition to that issue, some of the covenants have difficulty finding hosts. The game s matchmaking seems too restrictive which doesn t make sense since it s capable of scaling players down to the host s level. If you go and reach a high level with a character, be prepared to have a really difficult time reaching certain covenant ranks. The password matchmaking is quite good and allows friends to easily play with other friends. Just make sure you both spell the password exactly the same. I spent a large portion of my time engaging in jolly cooperation. I also did deliberate pvp which was also a good deal of fun. The multiplayer functions mostly and it s fun, but it carries the risk of contracting a digital STD. No one wants to be soft-banned unjustly. Yeesh.Whew, here are some other things that affected my time with DSIII: I ve seen my friendly phantoms die to an invader after I finished watching a boss intro cutscene, the patch notes for this game are vague to the point of being almost useless, the camera will sometimes work against you if you re too close to a wall, and the game has plenty of nods to the previous titles that sometimes turn into full body spasms.I really enjoyed Dark Souls 3, but hoo boy did I also grow frustrated with the game. I uninstalled and reinstalled it several times before finally keeping it uninstalled. I just grew tired of the problems it has, but I do acknowledge that there s still a great game in there to be experienced. It s just a darn shame that they went with the decisions they did that prevent the game from reaching its full potential. I was almost done with NG+ too. If you can look past its issues, prepare to buy.",0
Negative,"Let me Preface with thisI am a huge fan of Dark Souls and Bloodborne, (I've sunk well over 1k hours into each) I have played the second DS and didn't like it (Big suprise) and was looking forward to this one with optimisim and was hugely dissappointed Dark Souls 3 Is unbalancedI feel as if I am playing an early build where tweaking and rebalancing is in its early stages,Keep in mindI have multiple max all stat (all 99) characters I went to NG+9 and invested many hours into this game(Note I do not have very much PVP experience but I do have some. I am mostly reffering to Offline play in this review)1) Poise is non existant and worthless.Poise was a major factor in combat in DS 1. It allowed you to take hits without being staggered; if you had a high enough poise value. This allowed you to effectively trade blows with Mobs and Players. You could initiate an attack and not be staggered during the animation. Hyper armor is present in DS3 but it's situational at best. This leads to stunlock gameplay. The best/ultimate/only viable strategy for PvE is to equip all light armor and a weapon with good range and wide sweeping attacks to stagger every enemy in the vacinity and stun lock all of them. I.E. in the Boreal valley I used all light armor and the Wolf knight Great Sword to stagger ever enemy encounter before they staggered me and I got through the area unscathed. However if I tried to use heavier armor and trade blows I would loose everytime. So why bother using heavy armor at all? This brings up two more issues. Sheilds being useless, and enemy aggression/overall combat pacing.2)Shields. Sheilds have alway been a very usefull offensive and defensive item in previous souls games. The ability to throw up a shield and block an attack was invaluable. Enemy's blows could bounce off your shield and staggr your opponent creating an opening for you. Depending on the sheild taking a blow would not consume much stamina. However in DS3 I was onlyable to take 2 or 3 hits before my gaurd was broken on most normal sheilds. Thiswouldn't be a problem if the enemies werent so aggressive, but more on thatlater. The offensive side to sheilds in previous souls games in the Parry/Riposte Mechanic which also suffers in this game. I mastered Parrying in DS1 and as a result I could combat most enemies no problem. However in this game the parrying is almost entirely luck based. Enemies swing so quickly parrying is very difficult to perform. Especially when enemies have multi hit combos. Combined with the lack of poise and the stamina cosumed in blocking, screwing up a parry can cost you a fight. Great sheilds are also usless. They too consume a great amount of stamina when blocking attacks leading to frequent guard breaks. 3) Enemy AggressionThis is more of a personal opinion but I feel it still holds weight. Enemies are much more aggressive than they have ever been in a souls game. many enemies have multihit combos that result in the player being stunlocked due to the lack of poise. blocking does not help because your guard breaks easily. Rolling is the only efficient method to combat. Armor and sheilds are way to underpowered to deal with the aggressive enemies of DS3All of these issues lead to only one viable playstyle. Light rolling, and heavy weapons. Using Heavy armor is pointless as it yields no benefit. Shields can only block a few attacks at best before your guard is broken so why bother with them. The lack of poise leads to a stunlock gameplay. It feels as if I am playing bloodborne with a Souls skin. From should have made another bloodborne since they obviously wanted to4)Map designWhat is porbably my favorite design feature of DS 1 was the intricate map design. The waps were wooven together vertically which allowed for shortcuts and hidden passage ways. it was really interesting to explore the map and see how it folded back in on itself and how it flowed. Just the oter day I was playing DS 1 through again and I noticed that you can see Lost Izalith from the Tomb of The Giants bonfire. It made the map feel titly knit and jammed packed. Being forced to explore the map and every nook and cranny due to the inability to fast travel early on made me very familliar with themap. I now have it memorizeed like the back of my hand and can navigate it very quickly. However DS3 is rather linear. The map doesnt come together and suprise you like DS1 did. Its not a major issue I'm Just dissappointed slightly5) Hub WorldDS2 and 3 adopted a HUB approach to the game design. they forced you to return to a certain area to level up, upgrade weapons, and to purchase items. While in DS3 merchants, blacksmiths, andbonfires were all over the map. You could all your weapon upgrading, repairs, and leveling up from any bonfire. This allowed the game to flow and didnt interupt the exploration at all. Instead of warping back to a HUB and going through multiple loading screens just to level up I could instead do it all at a bonfire. This made my journey feel much more personal and lonely which really helped deliever the atmosphere of lonliness that Dark Souls nailed perfectly.The game does have some pluses however. It is visually stunning Some of the bossfights are fantastice. The music is top notchPvP from what I played is reasonably fun despite the many balancing issuesThe enviorments, while linear, are gorgeous and intterestingIt has interesting endingsthe Quests are fun and rewardingVoice acting is stellar",0

Negative,"Will remain a negative review until softban issue is resolved.Note: I was banned during the first ban-wave, FROM claims that the system has been changed meanwhile, but I have no way of verifying this one way or another. I went through almost 4 complete game cycles to get all possible gear and achievements on one character (one additional cycle because Sirris' quest line is made out of really thin paper) and now I got penalised for I don't even know what.Corruption must have happened during NG, as none of my save files (I made a copy before starting each new cycle) were able to remove the Invalid Game Data warning. Edit: In light of very recent evidence (FROM coming down from their throne to impart some knowledge upon the unwashed masses) it is clearer now why this approach didn't work. Even the complete removal of all game data after receiving the warning, was no guarantee that you wouldn't get penalised (by design, FROM claims, and contrary to everything the ""warning"" message said or implied.) While I had fun exploring and collecting everything, I have absolutely no desire to do it again. Since, let's face it, this game isn't all that deep once you have seen everything at least once before. The NG+ cycles are uninspired and unchanging. PVP is the real endgame and I'm barred from it as I write this. I wouldn t have bothered if rebirth wasn't a thing, if having a character with all gear to choose from didn't have a tangible benefit. Which is another gripe I have with the game (only 5 rebirths per cycle, no forgoing of SLs, you can't re-roll the starting class) but that is another issue, and one I would begrudgingly accept if everything else worked as it should. Which currently it doesn't.Get your shit together FROM. This is just disgraceful. Update 2016-05-02: Do not bother with Bandai Namco support. I finally got a reply out of them, after a few emails. It was a generic, canned reply saying that I should be patient. Yes, I am patient. Very patient. You have to be, if you are forced to do PVP on the shadow server. Talk about adding insult to injury.Update 2016-05-09: I opened a ticket to see if that works better than email. I linked this review and received a reply within 24 hours, asking me several questions. I answered the questions, but nothing has happened since then.Update 2016-05-13: I don't even care anymore.

Negative,"At the time of posting this, the cheating that's going on it this game is still an issue. Both valve(I understand they don't have to) and fromSoft refuse to do anything about the cheaters who have been running around in this game. Having put in a ticket with both steam and bamco about this I basically got a whole lot of f*uck you in response. Cheats since last I played outside of 5 mins ago to see if anything changed(well over a month ago at this point) fake phantoms that serve as dmg sponges, the usual infinite health/stamina, and the most annoying of all being one that will actually get you softbanned by fromSoft. These are still a thing. What makes it so bad was that these cheats started popping up around 2 or so weeks after the game came out. The rest of this review is based on my own personal feelings as someone who has played as sorcery based classes since demon souls. As for the actual gameplay my major complaint, besides enemies following the tired formula of have infiite stamina to bash you with, is how bad sorcery has it this time around. No one was asking for from to make the game easy for us(don't understand how it ever was. Dodging skills were a must in agressive boss fights and pvp). However with 90% of the bosses in this game being aggressive and spells damage being nerfed hard, it makes boss fight needlessly difficult and maybe even a little unfair. Playing as melee, Spell damage has been given really odd base requirements before the it become decent. Starting at 60 int is where you'll start to see the damage accel at. Keep in mind that in previous souls game you maxed out at 60 if you were hardcore sorcery otherwise 50 was perfectly fine at you're still dangerous. Remember how soul spear and the crystal spells(bar homing crystal in dks1) were good? Yeah not so much in this game. Incredibly slow and in most cases outclassed by the arrow spells. I started the game as a spellsword thanks to some people on reddit I was able to see just how jacked sorcery really was. To start my Dex was 25 and int 15 with base class being merc. Casting magic weapon wields an extra 50 points of dmg at best. I don't remember these results in the first 2 games. In DK1 with mild point allocation I remember seeing around 100 points of extra damage on an unupgraded weapon. In this game I deal with one swing 200~210 per swing on a normal enemy with a +3 Uchi. Respec to 31 dex and 21 int damage went from 263 to 290 with magic weapon. This was done as apparently you don't see minor returns on int until at least 20. So that's my opinion on this game from a spell slinger pov. I wanted to love this game. Really I did. But I have completely lost faith in from's ability to make an anti-cheat system that's worth a damn and that sorcery will stop being completely eclipsed by other styles of play.",0

Negative,"This negative review is solely about my experience on a PC. If you plan on buying this for PC beware the game is designed for console use and the user interface reflects that, a lot. All hints are given in a console style, LB + A for example. Every time some tutorial command popped up I eneded up having to go the menu (also designed for console use imo) to cross reference the command given versus the keyboard command. So theres some frustration and confusion right off the bat. Had to google how to jump and kick and I still havent figured out kick yet. Needs more cross platform support, maybe an option to map kick to a key. Other than that the game is spectacular, combat is smooth and realistic, and playing in the dark with head phones is downright scary and I'm a grown 40 year old man.

Negative,"I finally get to join the illustrious club of ""negative review after hundreds of hours of gameplay"". Despite enjoying myself at game launch for these many hundreds of hours playing the active PVP, I cannot recommend this game. Dark Souls 3 is a game that lacks soul, ironically. It's very polished, and I can't even really call it bad. but it never really tries to excel anywhere or experiment in any other ways that the previous games experimented. The story is a basic chosen one tale that just has you do the same thing that you've done in the other two games again but while being obsessed with self-reference (OMG look it's that thing from Dark Souls 1) and with none of the nuance of the previous titles or any attempt to try anything really new. Where Dark Souls 1 shrouds its story in a fallible myth that the player may not even discover the cracks in and where Dark Souls 2 tries to depict a new world built on the ashes of the old one struggling with themes of memory, identity, and loss, Dark Souls 3 tries nothing. It just falls back really hard on the key imagery of previous games (mostly Dark Souls 1 because the game really wants to tap into your nostalgia) without any of the other unique things that made that imagery work. The whole world is structured completely around the cycle of the first flame repeating for the millionth time and the importance of you as the Ashen One and nothing really questions it any significant way. Most of the NPCs are happy to be shopkeepers for you for the entirety of the game and don't really have anything interesting going on with them. The lore is a vague and sometimes jumbled up mess thanks to a rearrangement of content during the development cycle that is somehow even more incoherent then Dark Souls 2 which had a way worse development cycle. There's not really any theme other than decay and even that is not really explored in any meaningful way or employed beyond being set dressing. The alternate story paths provided by the game don't have any depth and yet again rely on imagery that has already been used more effectively in previous titles.The combat and visuals have improved compared to previous entries, but they both suffer from varying levels of blandness. The visual fidelity of the game is much greater than the last two Souls games, and there's great detail put into both the textures and the actual level geometry. Despite that, many places have a very limited color palette with washed out or gray colors, and it's common to find tombstones and corpses absolutely everywhere or giant piles of ash and dust, to an absurd point. There are still very stunning vistas that will drop your jaw, but everything kind of blurs together during the actual playthrough of the level. The combat is a lot faster than previous entries, and enemies and bosses alike are well animated and have a sometimes surprisingly large repertoire of beautiful or intimidating moves. This is especially true of the boss fights, which steal the show with their incredible visuals and good movesets, marking them as some of the best boss fights they've ever made. While the combat has sped up in the boss fights have improved tremendously in both presentation and in difficulty, it all lacks real depth. Stamina management and rolling are easier than ever in this game, making combat often boil down to roll at kind of the right time and then press r1 or cast a spell. This greatly diminishes the impact of the boss fights especially and reduces many of them to surprisingly lenient reaction time tests. Not all of the bosses suffer from this; some of the bosses towards the end of the main game and all of the DLC bosses start to use moves that are structured or delayed in a way to catch panic rolls or rolls that were timed to initial movement and not the actual swing. That is really as deep as it gets though. The actual level design is okay, but it lacks the intricacy of Dark Souls 1 or Bloodborne. Levels often are very linear with few branching paths, and the level to level exploration follows suit. This is the most linear entry in the series, and every diverging path is just a fork whose other path ends pretty quickly. These diverging paths also never really interconnect, meaning that when you're done it's just back to the main path or to the other path. Levels themselves and level to level exploration boils down to holding forward into the boss and then repeating that past the boss until you can no longer hold forward. It's not devoid of interesting things; there are a few interesting secret levels in the game. But most of the game playing is just finding the obvious path forward and then holding to it. The two things that I can say are really good are the music and the second DLC. The music is emotional, epic, and beautiful. There's not a bad track in the whole soundtrack, and all the songs are beautifully composed and performed to capture and enhance the mood of the boss with which they're paired. The second DLC has the most varied and expansive visuals and level design in the whole game, and as a whole homages the previous entries in the Souls series without the cloying, empty, and uncritical nostalgia of the references in the main game. Great bosses, great music, great levels, and the best Patches arc in all the games! Dark Souls 3 is a game that is far too safe. It seems deeply afraid to experiment or to truly do anything exceptional. All it seems interested in doing is being a medieval knight game with the same imagery as the previous entries in the series. I guess in that regard you can consider the game a success. But as the final entry in a series that has made its name through experimentation with how it presents its story, its themes, and the player's relationship to the world, it fails to really do anything but be a decent action title. If that's all you're here for, you'll probably like Dark Souls 3. But if you want anything that the previous entries experimented with or want a truly deep action experience, look elsewhere.",0
Negative,"DO NOT BUY DARK SOULS 3 ON PC. Bandai have now prevented family sharing.

Negative,"OMFG i cannot express just how mad the community for this game makes me. i have never in my life met such hatefull hackers and counter hackers EVER. let me put in better perception my experience with this trash heep of a game's community.so originally i had owned this game for PS3 and thought to myself after 100s of hours wow this game would be awesome if it could be modded so i had bought it for PC and knew nothing of the ban system (as a side note OMFG why DOES THIS GAME BAN PEOPLE SO EASILY BUT NEVER TOUCHES THE GRIEFFING HACKERS WTF) instantly i get in the game alter my stats so pretty much go through the game in a day because i was not there for the base game i was there for the modding of the game. tues comes around and in the same instant i modded my stats i get banned :/ ""ok no worries i clearly caused it"". so i learn about family share ""nice"" make a new account beat the game legit this time and start looking up whats ""bannable"" and whats not during this time i see a few videos around about peoples homemade boss characters and think wow that would be Amazing!, So i make one myself do a few matches in a high PvP area get all around well reception :3. But then the salty hackers comes online. I had decided to do a role play in the ringed city where i was the ""Void Lord"" causally strolling through the city with my phantoms acting as my royal guard. now as a side note i want to point out how much work it is to change anything in the game EVERY EFFECT AND EVERY CHANGE MUST BE MANUALLY IMPUTED EVERY TIME YOU LAUNCH THE GAME this takes hours my fastest time being two hours of raw data setting. i start my walk through the city not hiding that the ""hacks"" are in place i also want to point out that my ""boss""character does not fight and is very beatable not broken just flashy. but no a hacker who's character name is end see this as cheating breaks the role play invades me and insta curses me. Not only does he do this once but keeps invading just to insta curse. ""but Stormy"" you say ""you were hacking you deserve this"" i was trying to host a fun little role play not break the PvP element to the game. so i think to myself ""ok this dude is the only one its a bad day to do this"" log off and try again tomorrow.so again i get problems i log on the next day everyone plays along the invaders if have fun AS THE WHOLE THING WAS SUPPOSED TO BE. but then i find out that one of the players not only hacks items into the account to ban it but he also HACKS THE FAMILY SHARE ACCOUNT TO FORCEFULLY DISABLE THE FAMILY SHARE ON THE GAME.so yes if you ask is the game worth it on PC HELL NO! the publisher is to ignorant to figure out how to appropriately make a proper ban system and allows constant griefers to run rampant in the game.",0
Negative,"I don't recommend this game at all.In fact don't ever buy the game until they fix their issues up.Innocent people are getting banned because some autistic script kiddie decided to soft-ban people by exploiting the half-assed anti-cheat system this game has.I suggest everyone to give this game a bad review until they unban every innocent people that got banned cause of this and until they solve this issue.They don't deserve your money when they are being this unprofessional.Dont be a tool and protest againts this circus.Edit:Great Job, Namco!Now i am somehow banned for doing nothing bad too?

Negative,"I have never written a review a day in my life. But after seeing the recent news that family sharing was cut to prevent ""cheaters"" from playing on the official servers I believe the developer is just slapping us consumers because they couldn't figure out how to fix their own product. I love this game, love everything about it and how it makes me want to fling my controller at the screen. However, when a company gives little regard for people affected by hackers and just throws out one blanket ban after another to try and solve the problem they hurt the people that are trolled by hackers. It says something where a majority of the players (excluding new comers to the franchise) are in one sense or another banned, most of the time for doing nothing wrong apart from being hacked and reported by the hacker. Because yes, I have the technological know how to add a +1000 damage ring to my inventory when I barely can figure out how to work my smart phone these days. If you love this franchise by all means get it, but do not be surprised when you either get hit by a hacker and banned or are unable to find anyone to summon because most players are not on official servers anymore. (And most of them would never pay full price to get the game on a new account just to get banned again in a few days) I hate writing a negative review about a franchise I would play until the end of time, but it was something that had to be said for those who were wrongfully removed. (I am not alone in this belief, search the internet and you will find many a story already published on how this change will damage the player base with people even saying that its better to be banned so you dont need to worry about it anymore.)",0

The bosses are a lot better and more fun to fight this time around, though a good amount of them are still humanoid bosses, a common criticism for Dark Souls 2. Poise, for some odd reason, has been turned off, giving way to faster weapons being better and weapons that give super armor. The Covenants were made easier to switch between as you can just ""equip"" them but are even less interesting and have some design flaws (Like Blue Sentinels and Darkmoon basically being the same thing).The world design is much more linear now, while not a concern of mine, it can be for a lot of people.Anti-cheat is basically non-existent and is a joke.

Negative,"I know a lot of people are in love with the series but it just isn't fun for me. There's a thin line between hard and frustrating and this game is just frustrating. There's no sense of accomplishment after a hard area, there's only relief. All games should have difficulty options and I don't care what so called elitists kids say. These developers do not care and they ignore a huge number of potential buyers. Do they realize there are older gamers? People who are just bad at fast games? Or even handicapped gamers? Nope, these people are not allowed to play this. Easy mode wouldn't hurt ANYONE, it only would make some people happy.Why play it then if you don't like it you ask? Well, this game has amazing atmosphere, lore, music and wonderful artstyle so you know, just maybe people want to play it for these things? But the whole series is marketed as insanely difficult games and this creates toxic elitist community on top.I've got this from Humble bundle after playing Dark Souls 2. I managed to finish that one somehow and DS3 looked prettier and had much better level design, overall look and mood so I thought why not? I'll activate my key. And then the frustration started. I had absolutely zero fun with this. All those things I mentioned like lore, atmosphere, music, I forgot about them after couple of hours and stopped caring about them because frustration makes it impossible to pay attention to.So what is DS3? It's a third person action game with rpg elements and barely any story (I want to notice that story doesn't equal lore, the latter is great, or maybe i should say the story-telling sisn't good). You just run through the levels while fighting extremely cheap and overpowered enemies. They always have more health, no stamina system, they hit harder than you and they often ambush you and put you into an impossible situations.Basically there are few types of enemies only. They have different textures but they all have same moves and patterns. Worst thing is that if you die you must go through the level again. Unlike in DS2 you can't get rid of enemies here. Another stupid decision. DS2 was at least playable because of that.Bosses are pretty boring. Their visual design is awesome but the whole fighting is boring as hell. Bosses have few moves and just repeat them over and over again. Compare it to Monster Hunter and DS bosses feel like they were made with zero effort. Hey just put this huge boss there, give him insane amount of hp and strength and be done with it . It's just cheap lazy design. Cheap ambushes, cheap enemies, cheap bosses (which actually are easier than regular enemies).Controls are ok'ish. It's janky and unresponsive. You can easily fall, your inputs have intentional delay to make it harder to react. Rolling doesn't work half of the time. Shield should help huh? Nope. Shields worked as intended in DS2, but here shields barely help. You don't have any special moves or skills, can't even jump, you only need to press the button at the right time, 0,1 seconds too early or too late and you get hit and get caught in a series of non-stop attacks.I'm not sure what the story is about because it's way too hard to follow it when you get 30 seconds of story and then 10 hours of frustrating combat. That makes you forget what npc said and you forget what are you doing there in general.You think maybe you can farm/grind and level up like in normal game as Final Fantasy and make it easier or harder depending on how much you grind. Nope. Leveling up makes little difference. Instead of losing 40% of hp from one hit you lose 38%.One more downgrade comparing to DS2 is that you can't restore your health as many times as you want. Overall DS2 was a better game, not as pretty but it was balanced at least to some degree while DS3 is poorly balanced where nothing matters except your reaction time and ability to predict enemy moves.It has really dark and grim atmosphere which is stunning. It's rare for games to have such an amazing atmosphere, another one which pops into my mind is Stalker (another game I did not enjoy at all). That is accompanied by great soundtrack which transitions into epic music when fighting the bosses.There's also always online function which makes the game even harder. Other players can invade you and kill you. Another amazing useless feature. At least you can turn off invasions here but then you lose online features which helps sometimes a little.Graphically it looks average. Artistic style is amazing along with level design. Both environments and enemy visual design is amazing. But graphics in general aren't very good. The game is quite blurry, it lacks graphical options, locked to 60fps and has no native ultrawide support. These developers clearly do not care about user experience.Yes I know for those who are extremely good at action games this could be fun, but its not for me. Games should bring joy to you, entertainment, having good time etc. And this only induce stress, negative stress which overshadows all the amazing things this game has. This game is nearly impossible for me and I only feel frustration. Maybe i'll finish it someday if someone helps me out, otherwise I think I will never finish it. But i'm sure i'm gonna ignore all the souls-like games unless it's safe to use cheats.ProsGreat atmosphereGreat soundtrackGreat artstyleGood loreConsJanky controlsCheating, op, cheap AIFull of of cheap deathsWay too difficult for normal peopleNo out of the box ultrawide supportLocked to 60fpsBoring combatBoring bossesFrustrating gameplay which becomes tediousLeveling up makes little differenceToo repetitive",0

Negative,"Multiplayer shut down, save file corrupted.",0
Negative,"Generally good.But downvote because:- Camera/lock-on is unexpectedly worse than DSII, which is already bad enough.- The way they handle hack/cheat issue.",0
Negative,"I'd to expand on my previous review, especially with the point about anti-cheat. With the amount of money-grabbing, anti-cheat related shit and dumbing down on game mechanics, I can't give this or Dark Souls 1 demastered a positive rating anymore. As what is most likely the last in the Dark Souls franchise, my experience with Dark Souls 3 surpasses that of its predecessors. Soul Level Matchmaking is back, with an anti-twink measure (weapon reinforcement). Multiplayer is made way easier with password matchmaking too. (Thank goodness Soul Memory is gone.)The characters, lore, questlines, bosses are quite a massive improvement from DS1 and especially DS2, with all bosses having at least 2 phases and interesting backstories. Weapon movesets are rather varied, especially with the introduction of Battle Arts. Armor upgrades are gone but that means more Fashion Souls! It's also very nice to see customization options improved such as Character Creation and Optional Manual Attack Aiming.They should really work on the Poise system though, as stunlocking by Estocs and Straight Swords (Dark Sword) is. is. sigh. Phantom range is not as bad as DS2, but it happens sometimes due to bad connections on top of weapons like estoc and katanas. As for fanservice, of course there will be, but it is acceptable. (cough cough DS2 Old Dragonslayer cough cough) However, one thing that must be fixed in the softban issue. Many players falsely flagged as hacking/cheating, restricting online play. Luckily, it seems that the devs/publishers are actually doing something about it, albeit slow. All in all, Dark Souls 3 is a game well worth its asking price. Even new players to the franchise should pick it up if they can as it will provide them an exprience no other game can ever give. To players struggling with the game, I have this to say, ""Don't give up, skeleton!""",0
Negative,"This game comes with a neat feature. If you experience a power outtage or even a BSOD caused by the game, the anticheat built into the game will automatically corrupt your save file.You lose everything. This blind retribution is invasive and unreasonable in its emboldened action of corrupting data on the consumer's PC.If they had banned me from online multiplayer, I could have still completed the game. Instead I lose my time spent and am told I need to start over from scratch due to the developer/publisher's poor judgement.The first 80 hours were from the first playthrough. The game was not as fun the second time. Might just be that I have eidetic memory, but the mystery and confusion that the game series is known for was gone and it did not feel rewarding to complete it all the second time. I had made it to Lothric Castle the first playthrough (the one that was corrupted), completed all DLC as well, and I had that much of the game to replay just to get a sense of the ending,After playing all 3 Dark Souls games, I can really only endorse the first game. The level/world design of the first game was unrivaled with each game becoming more linear and less ""swiss cheese-like"" in how interconnected each area is to the whole rest of the world. This interconnectedness made the first souls game so very amazing.This game feels too polished and lacks the clunkyness of real world armored combat that the first game had. The weight of the movesets was a mechanic unto itself, where learning the timing and reach of the weapons were essential to successfully finishing an enemy before their hits connect.This game feels too much like Devil May Cry with all the fancy movesets. I would rather play Lords of the Fallen than this game.Feels more generic and far less mysterious and confusing than first Dark Souls. Lack of mystery affords less rewarding experience for accomplishing anything in the game because it is too straight forward. Glad they are not making a 4th Dark Souls as it would be too diluted from the original formula to be anything worth playing.",0
Negative,"So this game has a huge issue with hackers, like a HUGE issue the anti-cheat system in place is an ABSOLUTE joke. Like hackers can basically anything you can think of an experienced CE user can do it. One of the things that DOES ban you however is if you have an illegal or impossible item item in your inventory such as a stormruler +69. Now recently there has been a malicious script floating around that enables hackers to force said illegal items into other players inventories and get their accounts banned. As shitty as that situation was you COULD just make another stream account and family share the game to your new account to get yourself UN-Banned. As of today because FROMSOFT disabled familysharing of a game YOU LEGALLY OWN. You can no longer do this, this change is absolutely TERRIBLE because it enables malicious hackers to PERMANENTLY get innocent players banned. Fuck From Software and fuck Dark Souls 3 , DON'T Waste your money on this POS.",0
Negative,Alright game. But Bandai Namco / From Software have the worst consumer service I've seen in years. I've been banned for years. And don't even know why. Maybe picked up something a hacker dropped. And after 4 years it says no changes have been made so I will stay banned. Yet I reformatted my hard drives. Reinstalled Windows once a years. To make sure there was nothing on my PC that was messing me up. All characters are deleted. What else is left to do? But no one from this company is checking if any changes have been made to my PC. In my 25 years of gaming I have NEVER been banned from anything before. And have never been treated this way before. Keep away from this one. Or you might paid 60+ dollars for a game you can't play,0

Negative,"Online play is absolutely terrible. -People you summon might be ice-skating around and the same goes for invaders, hitting you with no animation and being impossible to attack. When being summoned to another hosts world you might have similar problems with lagging and even NPCs being statues taking dmg 5 seconds after being hit.-Covenants are absolutely broken. Blue Sentinels and Darkmoon Blades are the same thing and both share dependancy on way of the blue users. Not only does the way of the blue player need to be around the same level and weapon upgrade level they also need to have not defeated the area boss, so this leads to people never getting summoned as a blue in 200+ hours of gameplay. The matchmaking is even broken beyond that allowing some people to be consistently summoned as blues due to being prioritized for unknown reasons, making everyone else wait forever. So hope you will be one of the prioritized players or you will never be able to get any PvP with those 2 covenants ever.-Rosarias Fingers covenant is also completely useless, you never need to equip the covenant item as you can invade as any other covenant except for mound makers and Sunbros and be always rewarded with pale tongues which are the reward for Rosarias covenant. As a result players end up with hundreds of Pale tongues that they can do absolutely nothing with since every covenant item is worthless beyond 30. The general feeling you get is that the covenant system is an afterthought added into the game with no depth whatsoever. Grind 30 of each item and never bother with the covenants again.-Invading is broken. You invade a host who can have 3 phantoms at the same time, each with Estus flasks to heal themselves and the host with 25% increased health due to being embered. If you somehow manage to kill a phantom the host can immediately summon another. So have fun invading into a 4v1 gankfest with the latency inconsistencies mentioned.Play through the game offline and experience the different endings and never look back and never go online and you will have a good time. If you try PvP or online play you will be gravely disappointed.",0

Negative,dont play this game right online right now as there is a remote executable exploit that puts your pc at risk.,0
Negative,"Do not get the game yet, as the servers are not up and are a pretty important part of the game.",0
Negative,"My game has been ruined by an exploit which the developers could have fixed but chose not to. It's unacceptable. Indeed this exploit has been described as possibly allowing other players to negatively influence your computer in ways outside of just influencing your save.This game is literal malware, and should be removed from steam until the developers have fixed it.",0
Negative,"No Cloud Saves. This is the exactly the kind of game that absolutely needs to have cloud saves. It's easy to implement. Almost every developer, large and small, does it. The worst part is that the game makes a big, dramatic fuss about ""Syncing"" and ""Retrieving your save data"" every time you start it. But all of that is for nothing. The game works *exactly* as if your game saves were stored locally only. Any time you have an issue with Windows, need to free up space or whatever, your progress is irretrievably wiped. The game forgets that it was ever installed on your system.",0
Negative,"The game itself is excellent in most respects. From Software's treatment of their paying customers? Not so much. I was banned from multiplayer on accusations of cheating/hacking: I have not modified the game in any way whatsoever and From offered no evidence in support of their claims. They won't be getting a dollar from me ever again, and if even 1/4 of the internet is to be believed, I am far from the only one who has been treated this way. Buy this game if you like giving your money to people who then make false accusations and ban you from using a major part of the product you paid them for.",0
Negative,"Wonderful game, can't recommend enough. However, some hackers have recently become active who can put your character in a NG/NG+ (with all of your gear, inventory and SL) through the very fact of your summoning or invading into your world. Doing so makes your character vulnerable for anti-cheat ban cause now you look like a cheater. Word is that it was reported to the devs about exploits in the net code but they didn't respond. And now here I am, losing all 66h progress of my first run because of this.Stay safe and use anti-cheaters modes, now I am aware that there are some good options out there.",0

Negative,"I'm really trying to like this game but i get invaded every 5 minutes by either a player who clearly has much much much better stuff then i have or a straight up cheater. I also feel like i cant criticize this game without all the fanboys acting like i just butchered their Sacred cow. I loved the pvp in dark souls 1 and 2 so its not like i just don't like dark souls pvp. I'm not sure what i don't like more. How toxic this game can be or the people who are willing to defend it. Its like people cant understand that maybe there's a happy medium between getting invaded every 10 minutes by someone whos clearly got far better stuff then you and never getting invaded at all. I had to literally go offline for the aldrichs faithful area cause of how insane it gets. Which is sad cause i used to love the coop community and the invasion community. I love taking part of it and doing the covenant stuff but this just goes to an extreme. Hopefully this is just cause of the covid-19 and everyone is just online right now cause if this is the norm i have seriously lost respect for these developers. Also when people say that is excusable merely cause those are the intended game mechanics i really think you have your head up your dark hole. Just cause its an intended game mechanic doesn't even remotely mean that its a good one. I can make a game mechanic that makes it so you have to hit an enemy 1 million times before you kill then and they only have to hit you once to kill you plus your character is blind so your screens black and oh your opponent can move faster than you can react.that doesn't mean anything cause just its in the game. And those who say ""stop complaining and just play offline"" just show how bad the pvp really is. Cause that means i literally have to stop playing a decently big part of the game all cause of one toxic mechanic. I shouldn't have to forgo many fun gaming mechanics cause of one terrible one. ""go offline"" isn't a solution its a testament to how bad this game is with pvp. I'm sure some people are going to rabidly defend this games pvp but hopefully those who are actually willing to put down the pitch forks and listen hopefully this review can give you some insight. There is alot good about this game but thats no excuse for how terrible the pvp portion is.",0

Negative,no online multiplayer server support since Elden Ring released. I was looking forward to playing DS3 in co-op with a friend while I wait for Elden ring to get a few patches but that's no longer an option -.- 4/10.,0
Negative,"I've been trying SO HARD to actually enjoy this game. And the first DS for what matters. On the paper these are games I should love: I really like the art style, the theme, the quirkiness. The inventive bosses design, the many way the game can be played, the many weapons, etc.I like the slow pace, being rewarded for being clever and thinking outside the box. Love the exploration, the level design.I should love this game but I just can't.I played twice: a few years ago for about 8 hours and again now, because of the hype around Elden Ring, I wanted to give this franchise a second shot. I've also played a bit more hours of DS1 which I prefered overall.Now I've been stuck again for hours at end with the first boss, Iudex Gundir. I can almost kill him but just by luck most of the times.I tried not fighting him to understand his attack patterns, I played defensive waiting for my window of opportunity and then striking him. The second phase is what I find unfair: the boss assumes a shape so odd and so big that it's really hard to tell what's going on on the screen, to begin with. There's no way to understand its patterns because I just can't see shit of what's going on. Overall after hours of trying to fight the same boss, I see no progress at all. It is just too much frustrating.I gave up. My theory on this Souls game: some people have grown up playing this type of 3D games with controller, I've never owned a console apart from an ATARI 2600 in the late 80s and a NES. I believe I'm just not trained enough to play 3D games with a controller.And then when I look at people playing it on YT they make it look super easy, I saw people beating Iudex Gundir at their first try. There's something to get used to that I just can't see. The movement system, the constant timing of the rollings, getting used to the timings of the hits.I don't know, I'm a bit jealous of people that are enjoying this kind of games because I can see the appeal but I have to admit to myself I'm not meant to play and enjoy them.Have fun!EDIT: Out of spite, I've bought Elden Ring and I'm really enjoying it, especially the combat! It may sound absurd but I believe after I'll finish ER I'll give the old DS games a third chance. Thanks for all the awards, you git gud folks!",0

Negative,"I enjoyed the game, but my progress got reset because of a retarded hacker. Think they should invest in some anti cheats. Not invest anymore time in the game until they get shit sorted out.Always save you game files after each boss if you wanna be sure.",0
Negative,"This is my personal opinion""I expected nothing and was still let down"" describes how I feel about this game and here is why:I have played a whole lot of Dark Souls 1 and 2 and some bloodbourne on console and have been a huge fan since. To begin with I have to say the game plays amazingly fluent in PvE. Hitboxes are great, rolls feel really smooth. The bosses are some of the most memorable fights in the entire series. Although I dislike the artstyle of bloodbourne and Dark Souls 3, I have to say the game looks great, not amazing but great. Since the release of Dark Souls 2 I became a massive Pvp enthusiast. Despite great flaws Dark Souls 2 offered endless motivation: a sheer endless amount of builds, weapon variety, great possibilities to outplay your opponent and much more. I feel like Dark Souls 3 misses out on so many of these things. Backstep invincibility frames are gone, power stance is gone, arenas are gone. This game feels like a downgrade in terms of online gameplay to me. Furthermore most of the weapons feel the same. Movesets are mostly the same and nothing extraordinary. Weight makes no difference for stamina recovery or invincibility frames which then gives no reason to use light weight armor at all. Also NG+ is another disappointment. No new enemies, no new armor or weapons, only upgraded versions of rings. So no real motivation to go into NG+ at least for me. As for now one of the most core mechanics of the series is simply turned off: Poise. Wearing heavy armor used to give your character poise which resulted in you not being stunlocked by light attacks. Now that this is turned off you can get stunlocked by a rat even when wearing heavy armor. Bandai namco is denying that this feature is turned off and are simply saying: ""works as intended"". In other words there is little to no hope this will ever get fixed. Dark Souls 2 has been a complete mess the first months after release too but not like this. Despite insanely broken weapons, spells, mechanics the game was still fun. I can not say this for Dark Souls 3. I want to love this game but I can't. All in all: If you are looking for singleplayer, this is your game. But in terms of online gameplay and PvP this game blows as for now. Maybe it will be fixed, probably not.",0
Negative,"Bandai Namco blames players for getting their saves ruined by invading cheaters.Also since poise dosent work, over half of the armors are useless.This game is currently getting staggered simulator.If you want to play Dark Souls 3, play it on consoles.",0
Negative,"Love this game. Bought it a while ago and had countless hours of fun with it. But online is a large portion of all of Dark Souls games. And the servers are offline and it looks more and more like they are offline for good. And yet the game is labeled as ""coop"" and sold for $59. That's full price for what is essentially half a five year old game. Not recommended.",0

Negative,"Entertaining game but have the worst publisher. Just think, Namco ban you for what a dude with scripts could do to your account with CE.

Game itself was very good.",0
Negative,"I'll start this off with saying I'm a huge fan of FromSoftware and their games. Dark Souls and Demon Souls are games that are great enough to have an entire genre based off of them. Across the Dark Souls trilogy I have over a thousand hours across PS4 and PC - so it goes without saying I've enjoyed it at some point.To get to the point, the issue with Dark Souls III isn't the game, it's a chunk of it's community in online play. I'm not going to sit here complaining about 3v1s, cheesy tactics or chugging, but there's so many cheaters here now. A big part of Dark Souls for a lot of players is the PvP, but whats the point when people can teleport you/mobs, deliver instant kills from nowhere or toggle invincibility?I mean just recently while invading as an Aldrich Faithful, my screen went black then I got a ""You Died"" screen pop up repeatedly while I lost all my souls. Couldn't even do anything aside from force closing the game as I was stuck in a cycle of death. As far as I'm aware, that's shouldn't be possible. Sometimes you meet some cool people who respect the game and people trying to play it, and you'll get a fair game. But with how rampant it's been today I feel like I have to leave this negative review.I was hoping to get back into this game's PvP after a long hiatus, but I really couldn't recommend it - hopefully one day they find a way to prevent it from happening, but I'm sure someone will still find a way to ruin it.As a side note - might be worth buying on discount as a game to play offline.For any real players still out there, you're masochists.",0

Thanks for trying to shove a fat_down my throat Namco.,0
Negative,Clearly i love this game but after 2 months of the servers being offline all they did was remove the multiplayer tag from the dark souls games on steam. The online component is a pretty big part of DS3 for me. Some of my most memorable moments in this game were just messing around with other people. I guess that's not happening anymore.,0
Negative,"For the time being this is going to be a negative review, don't get me wrong the game is great and all but I would like to point out a lot of aspects that just make the game bad and no I am not going to rant about the bad optimization but rather the overall feeling of the game and how the ""PVP"" works.Right let's start it off with this game is not hard, the bosses themselves feel quite easy to kill especially with adapt not being in the game anymore its not so much of a challenge to roll out of certain attacks or for the most part you don't even have to roll at all you just use a shield and block all of the attacks yes that is possible now and makes the fights feel just that much easier.Here is an example of a new player to the souls series taking down Pontiff Sulyvahn on their second try:For the PVP it feels like a step back from the Dark Souls 2 more strategy orianted PVP to more Bloodborne mixed with Dark Souls 1 which was okay but that was 2011 and I would like to see an upgrade not a downgrade. For parrying it doesn't even feel rewarding anymore because its so easy to pull off unlike in Dark Souls 2 where you had to know your timings very well to do the parry. As for the rest of the PVP R1 spamming is more rewarding along with shield whoring not only that but its nearly impossible to break through greatshields also I would like to point out that the weapon arts feature feels like its a thing for newcomers to the Dark Souls series because you get a skill with a push of a button like seriously earn your kill don't rely on a in game ""skill"" to help you win. Two more things I would like to point it is the chugs, iframes and HP as an invader. In Dark Souls 2 you would have adaptibilty as your source of iframes and your chug speed which was a great idea it would stop the host from trying to chug and if he had phantoms with him they were not allowed to chug and the host could not heal them by chugging which made ganking situation more fair in a sense that you had a chance to kill the phantoms and the host. However in Dark Souls 3 there is no adat and everyone can chug and also the host has extra 300hp bonus thanks to the ember how does that make things fair I mean sure you can chug so what if the other phantoms can chug too I do know that you get an estus for each phantom you kill but that doesn't necessarily mean that its more ""fair"".Overall the setting of the game and feel is fantastic the game immerses you very well into its world and is very nostalgic so many things to remind you of the past and I really do love Miyazki for brining back most of these things that we loved about Dark Souls 1 but nostalgia cannot save the game alone.If the PVP does change which it will of course they have to balance out the game but in its current state I will leave this review as it is and when the game changes ovetime I will re-write my review and give my definitve answer.",0
Negative,"Great game, but malicious script kiddies and poor anti-cheat systems are currently teaming up to ruin online play for a lot of players.

Negative,"had three hard crashes in two hours worth of play, all without warning, running smooth on max settings.alse random 1-2second freezes sometimes when picking up items.",0
Negative,"I love the souls series. I've played 'em all for hours on end. Even this one, you'll find, i've sunk 300 hours into. But 299 of those hours were spent lying to myself. I was happy that soul memory was gone, and that the password system had made it in. But the password system wasn't the only thing they took from Bloodborne. The combat system functions more like Bloodborne than Dark Souls. Dark Souls was about being caution, timed blocking and stamina management. Now it's about being fast, and agressive. That worked in Bloodborne, but Dark Souls 3 gives you the tools to play cautiously, like other souls entries, but encourages that you play fast and agressive. There are many risks to playing slowly and carefully such as being guard broken or being overwhelmed, but all these risks can be negated by abusing the powerful dodge roll. It costs little stamina and has incredible frames, which can be further buffed by rings. The plot is a mess. ""Time is convoluted in Lordran"" is what we're told, but that statement can be used to answer most lore questions. There are a few interesting character questlines, and these really shine. When the game isnt appealing to your nostalgia by directly and unironically refrencing the previous games is where Dark Souls 3 perks up. But then they recycle a theme, location or straight up character and the game shrugs its shoulders and says ""time is convoluted but isnt it cool they're here?"" The DLC does little to bring anything new, content to wallow in nostalgia. They even go as far as to make a certain boss painfully similar to a Bloodborne boss. Anything new is shoved aside and concluded poorly to focus on refrences. One of the most praised elements of Dark Souls 3 is its level design, but even there the laziness shows. The world isn't interconnected, like Dark Souls 1. There are 3 branching paths that are available later in the game; a secret area acessed pretty cleverly, a second secret area accessed by going left in a fork in a road, and the DLC. The rest of the levels are in sequence. The level themselves are pretty boring, however. They do look good and are visually pleasing, but very often rely on ""find a bonfire and then unlock shortcuts back to that bonfire."" There are very few options for alternate ways to progress, as most levels are incredibly linear. Some areas either have a shortcut available that just needs some clever dropping/jumping, or are simply huge open forested areas. Exploring these areas yields very little, as equipment is very limited. There are plently of weapons available, but each weapon class has its clear best choice, while the other weapons in its category are largely worse. There is no replayability in Dark Souls 3. Once you've beaten the game, you'll find that NG+ has nothing new to offer except some stronger versions of already exsisting rings. The only point to NG+ aside from the rings is resetting your respec currency and respawning the bosses. The bosses are where the game really shines, sometimes. There are very few unique and original ideas for bosses here. They tried to step away from armored humanoids that Dark Souls 2 continued to throw at us, but ended up relying on that trope too much again. So many bosses are praised to be the best in the series, when they're painfully generic. The soundtrack sounds good, but all the songs are interchangable. ""An orchestra has a fit while a woman goes ""ahhhhhhhhhhh"" sums up most tracks in the game. A lot of bosses are just more nostalgia pandering as well, as they all have some tie to a previous souls game. It wouldn't be so bad if they expanded on the refrence, but they dont. The refrences are there just to refrence. That's it. The bosses can be defeated by rolling through their attack, then pressing your attack button as fast as you can. Rinse, repeat, dead. There are very few bosses that deviate from this, but the ones that do either die in one hit after jumping through some hoops or are defeated using a special weapon that directly refrences Demons Souls. I tried to tell myself that all the obvious pandering, poor gameplay and horrible multiplayer was ok. It was more Dark Souls, that's not a bad thing. But it is. From Software designed Dark Souls 3 to be a trip down memory lane, to be experience once and then shelved. It might be the closest thing we get to Bloodborne on the PC, but that doesn't mean i'm supposed to ignore the issues and praise it because it's the last entry in the series. It's unfortunate that Dark Souls had to end this way. If you're looking to pick up Dark Souls 3, don't. Play the other entries in the series and don't spoil your love for the series with this lazy attempt to appeal to it.",0
Negative,"Servers still down after 3 months! For a game franchise that has such a massive loyal fan base and community and they hit us with something like this. I cant even explain the amount of disgust and shock that a company would even try to harm their community the way they have done. all the souls borne are absolute masterpieces and new players to the franchise that are might come from Elden Ring will never experience the same experience that all us fellow fans have experienced (yes they can play solo but were is the PVP or even messages to leave for new players to guide them on there journey). I'm not sure if the developers had looked at the success of Sekiro (I love the game BTW) and thought that they could do the same thing to dark souls but it just does not translate into a game like Sekiro. I know for a fact that I am not the only one thinking this as anyone can see on this page dark souls used to be above 93% positive and now its been lowered to 76% and counting. I understand why they took the servers down to fix a serious issue but there are people who have already written the crucial lines of code that could be implemented and then everyone is happy, to me it does not make sense with the launch of Elden ring for people that complete it they can revisit / be introduced to dark souls. Please bring the servers back thank you.",0
Negative,"I have mixed feelings about Dark Souls 3. On one hand, it's not obviously bad in some places like Dark Souls 2, but on the other I don't know what this game is trying to be. It has elements from all 4 Soulsborne games that don't go well together. It's definately an enjoyable game, if you're into the Souls series, but also disappointing in some ways. Let's start out with the positive side of Dark Souls 3:+The game looks gorgeous, no question about that. Probably the best looking Souls game on PC to date. +The world is huge and well connected. Not quite as well connected as DS1, but you can see other areas from your current area (like seeing the Bell tower from Sen's Fortress) and there are no weird Earthen Peak -> Iron Keep situation. +It is easier than every to play with friends with the new password system (although I've seen people say it doesn't work)Now let's talk about what I don't like in Dark Souls 3:-My main problem with the game is the change of pace. Enemies are a LOT more agressive this time around, with seemingly infinite stamina and long combos. It gets particularly bad mid to late game when enemies get a ridiculous damage and health boost. The game essentially punishes you hard if you do anything other than roll and mash attack. Tanking is pretty much pointless (you can't even upgrade armor) and magic users are at a serious disadvantage compared to previous games since their casting speed is so slow and scaling is so messed up early to mid game that you'll be spending more time swinging a sword than casting Soul Arrow. I heard scaling gets better around 50 INT/FTH but I don't care enough to get to that point. -There is a LOT of reused content in this from all previous Souls games. I don't want to spoil it, but there are more recycled characters than new ones. Same could be said about the armor and weapon sets. There is an area that is LITERALLY ripped straight from Dark Souls 1. I know the official explanation is some time distortion shit, but really it's just lazy pandering. I can bash Dark Souls 2 all day, but at least it had more original content than this-Covenants are kind of half baked. People have been reporting that some don't even work properly. -This is the THIRD game on PC that still has fucking Xbox prompts. Why is no one complaining about this? Some people actually play with a keyboard and it's not even that much effort. Modders have been doing it since DS1. Maybe I'm just tired of the Souls formula at this point, but at it's current state Dark Souls 3 is not as fun to play as Dark Souls 1. It's certainly better than Dark Souls 2 but that's not really saying much. I would advise you to wait for the inevitable GOTY edition which will hopefully fix the gameplay issues I have with the game. As it stands it's an okay game, with some really glaring issues.",0

Negative,"the only award this game should take is for being the worst in its trillogy. this game isthe downgrade remastered version of darksouls1. this fraud of a game has the same bosses, the same locations, the same weapons, the same story, and without shame,they even put the same boss movesets.this game is a fraud. it was meant to be a legal money laundry with a very specific target: no life cucks with noodle arms and used wifes. could never be me btw.nothing is special about this trash. the only notable thing they did is the fact that now they charge 20$ more for a way poorer experience.",0
Negative,"The bad is far outweighing the good these days on Dark Souls 3 PC. The biggest issue is of course hackers. They're rampant at the meta (SL100-SL140), and there is absolutely nothing you can do when they hit you with a Souls hack, once it has been done you must delete your character and start over, and for someone with as many hours as I've put in on not only PC, but PS4 over 800 hours, Xbox over 500, and on PC 421 hours, most of which was with CHARACTERS I HAD TO DELETE BECAUSE OF HACKERS. It sucks the joy out of the game, and then these trolls sit here sipping their Mountain Dew making excuses for why they hack. It's SIMPLE, you suck at the game, therefore you feel the need to hack. All the cool things these hackers could do and they try (and often succeed at) getting legit players banned. It's not funny, in anyway, and only serves to anger the good people that paid with their hard earned money for a game that penalises the victim rather than the villain. If I end up getting softbanned, because a hacker modified my save file I'll just go back to PS4 painful as it will be considering the lower grade graphics, and FPS, but it's a lot better than dealing with hackers on a daily basis. If you're just now getting the game, play offline.",0
Negative,"Dark Souls 3 is not a bad game, but I wouldn't recommend it unless you have no other Souls-likes in From Software's catalogue to play. If there is another Souls-like in From's catalogue you haven't played yet, go play that instead.Dark Souls 3 is an awkward compromise between Dark Souls and Bloodborne. It wants you to play with the speed and agression of Bloodborne, and so it nerfs or removes many of the defensive mechanics from previous Dark Souls games, like poise. At the same time, because it wants to be a sequel to previous Dark Souls games, it does not include any of the mechanics that make Bloodborne's pace of play fun, like rallying. The result is a game with a confused mechanical identity. While Dark Souls 3 is by no means bad (none of From's modern games are bad), it is the least fun to play out of all of From's Souls-likes.",0
Negative,"Mechanically speaking, it feels like some weird middle ground between the combat of Bloodborne and Dark Souls, and not always in a good way. The backstory is likewise a jumbled mess with inconsistencies and hanging threads everywhere, despite the actual plot you follow being basically a retread of the first game. That isn't a bad thing in itself, but it compounds the other story issues when the first kept things so much more coherent even in ambiguity. There's still some brilliant level design to be found, although it's balanced out by some equally stupid design choices. As well, the setpiece fights are as gorgeous as ever, but some enemies are so big and visually busy as to obscure their own tells (a problem leftover from Bloodborne), making fighting them that much worse. Netcode seems noticeably sloppier too, given how often phantoms get bugged out of joining boss fights- I've been on both ends of that problem myself.If you're a big fan of the series and dead set on playing this final entry, I guess I can't blame you. Just know that this swan song stumbles as much as it succeeds, and if you came for closure, you're going to be disappointed.",0
Negative,"The game gets a load more hate than it should, it's not as bad as people say.

Negative,"PVE is good but this review covers the PVP in this game:No regional matchmaking or connection preference: 70% of your fights are going to be against people from the other side of the world which is unplayable because it throws off the balance. It might take a couple seconds for your opponent to take damage on your end which might also prevent you from getting combos, you can get hit from ranges where you would never expect to get hit or they teleport around without any animations if their own connection is horrible.This game has no anticheat: You can have your whole savefile ruined with Cheat Engine and you can only combat this by making backup saves or protecting yourself with other third-party programs. Reporting profiles on Steam doesn t do anything.The devs stopped patching this game: Some weapons clearly outperform others and this is because the balance is focused on PVE. This game also has some terrible glitches/exploits.",0
Negative,"While a lot of fanboys will rage at this review, I need to make this clear that this is a shitty console port.What I mean by that is they literally took the xbox one version, stapped a resolution to it, added steam integration and shipped as - is. Tooltips ingame tell you to press ""(A)"" on your controller when you do not have one plugged in.Mouse makes you turn your camera and you have to press W to actually turn your character,.The port was done so poorly that even if its gameplay would be good, I say go buy it on a console, it's meant for that. Don't support a lazy steam port.Thats not even taking into account people that get banned from multiplayer for no reason // Having a hacker invade them.If you're a fan of darksouls, give yourself a favor and get the console version instead.

As someone that pre-ordered it, I felt really disappointed overall. Everything bad in the series came back worst: horrible camera angles, cheap difficulty, NPC bossess, useless magic and a wide array of b II$H!t. Other than that, now I know what real garbage is.

Negative,"They just removed family sharing from this game as a warning. Dark Souls 3 is a fantastic game and I love it. However this (my primary account) got soft banned a long time ago due to hackers modifying my character and never got unbanned after clearing my data. So I had to use family sharing as my account to this day is still penalized. Now my choices are: Buy this game again because of someone else or play only with people who have also been soft banned (my friends who play are not on said list). If From Software was going to decide to do this they should at least ACTIVELY restore wrongfully punished accounts.Now again, this is a great game and has tons of replay value, but if you have a chance to randomly get banned and have no fix, what's the point?EDIT: After appealing to Namco support my account is finally unbanned after over a year, but they've said next time a character gets modified it's a permanent ban.

Negative,"Dark souls 3 is frustratingly amazing, but in its current state I do not recommend the purchase of this title.Dark souls pc servers have been offline for two months as of the time of this review, due to an rce exploit. This exploit would have definitely made its way into Fromsofts recent title Elden Ring, if it hadn't been made readily apparent by the community anti-cheat developers ahead of time. With the most recent title exceeding 500,000 players at any given time I wouldn't be surprised if the Servers never come back as they're most likely being used. I can't imagine they would release Elden Ring without patching this issue, or maybe they just slapped easy-anti-garbage onto it as a band-aid fix and this could possibly explain why from has been on hiatus in regards to any announcements outside of the obligatory post on feb9/10.currently 4 out of 5 souls games are not playable online, so no ghosts, messages, bloodstains, co-op/multiplayer/pvp. all online aspects for the pc dark-souls series are currently inoperative, if you play exclusively for these reasons i would recommend to play on console.edit: officially offline for three months.",0

Negative,"Stay away from this trash IF you like complex, deep, elaborate combat. From start to finish, this game boils down to mashing two buttons: hit and roll. That's what you gonna be doing. It's the most dull, repetitive, shallow game I've ever played. The only redeeming feature is the graphics and the atmosphere, but when a game that's all about fighting fails dismally when it comes to the combat system, there's no saving grace. Don't get misled by all those 10's disgorged by fanboys, they're only playing it to prove how amazingly pro and superior they are to 'casuals'. If you look at any gameplay, you will see within 10 seconds EVERYTHING that games has to offer - a roll and a hit. That's all there's to it. Some of the enemies are gonna be bigger, some of the weapons are gonna be more rusty. But in the end this 60 dollar 'masterpiece' can be summarised in three words: roll and hit. 1/10. For graphics.",0

Freaking GTA V, a game that keeps selling copies even 8 years after its release. That much tells you how money mongering these guys are. Last game i bought from this publisher, even if it means skipping on the upcoming Tales of Arise. Go screw yourselves.",0
Negative,"It's certainly a bad look that FromSoft's multiplayer service was demonstrated to give hackers command access to user's computers, even worse when you know that their policy before the leak was to just ban anyone who was invaded by a hacker, but at least they shut the online servers down after the leak. I honestly don't miss the frequent interruptions by smurfing invaders that typified my experience with the previous Dark Souls games, so that was no loss to me. Unfortunately the problems with this entry run deeper.Dark Souls games have been lauded for being very tough but essentially fair, and I found that to be largely true in the previous games. Sure, enemies will get the drop on you now and then with ambushes and tricks, but there was at least a sense that the game was internally consistent, the enemies at least seemed to play by the same rules as you.In this game it's obvious that half the enemies have infinite poise (resistance to interruptions), and even if they've just finished a long string of heavy attacks that missed and you're swinging in to punish them, don't be surprised to get interrupted mid-swipe by an immediate new combo because they also have clearly infinite stamina and YOUR poise stat counts for nothing. Oh you're a heavily armored knight with very high poise you say? Well you better keep your shield up to any knife wielding ghouls or dog-sized rats because they'll knock you right out of your stance with one jab to your armored shins.If the previous games were 90% hard and 10% BS, this one's about 75/25. It's still not a majority but that's a lot of bull to take, it grates on a person. It's probably a similar overall difficulty level to previous games, but it's been sped up significantly, which has the knock-on effect of making victory rely more on reflexes and luck rather than just caution, knowledge, and timing. The bosses in the first 10 hours have either been very fast and relentless, or very big but able to do high damage over a large area, in both cases they lacked useful tells or inertia to many of their attacks. I would end up winning - sometimes on the 1st, sometimes on the 10th attempt - by simply running in to do as much damage as I could, taking the unavoidable damage as a result, then retreating to heal, and repeating until they were dead or I was. Caution was essentially useless because any attempt to mitigate the damage either drained my stamina more (blocking) or resulted in much less damage to the enemy (retreating early), and usually resulted in taking just as damage anyway.It's possible that since people loved Bloodborne so much (since it was brilliant in a lot of other ways too), they thought we just wanted to be all aggression all the time, so defense and caution in Dark Souls 3 was nerfed even more. but it's at odds with itself, you still get punished for going all-offense like Bloodborne a lot of the time, the net result is the game is just more punishing.",0
Negative,They've removed multiplayer when there is still a massive online community for this game. I now have an objectively worse version of the game that I bought. Not very consumer friendly behaviour.,0
Negative,"I have never written a review for this game since i felt it was not necessary since it has always been a great game and a challenging one also one that i always enjoyed playing with friends and even the PVP community was strong and serious about the game bringiong it to an excelent state where no matter how difficult the game or the PVP was it was always rewarding even losing a fair and square PVP match since the game always pushed you to become a better player and to keep improving this game WAS REWARDING.With all of this said now I will start with the ad things and for me its not much things, in fact there is only 1 thing and is THE SORRY STATE IN WHICH YOU FROMSOFTWARE HAVE YOUR GAME, with all of the hackers present on this game more and more honest players have abandoned this game and almost 100% of remaining player base are hackers who not only they seek to ruin the game for others but also to steal from them and you should be aware that its incompetent to let your fan and player base to fix your mistakes so unless you are willing to do something about this issue which by the way is the main one and protect your players against this I WILL REFUSE TO KEEP SUPPORTING YOUR GAMES AS YOU CLEARLY DONT CARE ABOUT US PLAYERS, and by the way I am pretty sure even if this is the only bad review the game has I am not the only player that feels this way, FYI YOUR GAME IS AWSOME.

Negative,"As much as I love the dark souls franchise, I simply CAN NOT give this product a thumbs up in its current state because of a devastating and unacceptable issue that fromsoftware and bandai refuse to address. There are hackers on this game that will invade your world and AUTO INJECT hacked items onto your character unconsentually ( there is nothing you can do to stop them from putting these items in your inventory), and the next time you log onto dark souls you will be perm banned and unable to play online ever again.There is literally no way to drop these hacked items once they are given to you, so at that point you are either faced with a decision, to either alt f4 and delete your character with possibly hundreds of hours of progress (and hope this method works) or get perm banned from the game for life.So now if you choose to play this game online with friends you are essentially gambling because you can be invaded at any time by one of these hackers and their sole purpose is to just get you banned. There's nothing you can do about it. This issue needs to be fixed and addressed now. I don't care if this game came out in 2016, if you are selling a product for $59.99 or any amount of money and you just simply drop it and refuse to take care of it, then it doesn't deserve to be bought.PATCH THIS GAME AND STOP BANNING INNOCENT PLAYERS!",0
Negative,"PVE is less inspired and way less fun than both of the other games, for a wide variety of reasons I don't really feel like describing.PVP is completely unplayable garbage, and clearly just an afterthought to the base game of PVE.* Nightmarish latency issues that are routinely as bad as dial-up internet used to be, or worse. I'm talking ping in the thousands. In the range of actual full seconds.* The mechanics of game are designed for none of the above. Sidestepping is virtually impossible, and if you try it, you will probably get ""hit"" by the sword that is visibly ~4m away from you.* Apparently some information is handled client-side while other information is not, meaning that you can roll away from a swing, hear the sound effect for damage received on your screen but take none of it, and somehow wind up with bleeding also even though you (I think?) didn't get hit.* The actual method of getting PVP going is terribly designed. The dedicated arenas are only active for 1v1s because apparently actual organized teams just stomp all through the brawls and team battles so no one plays them.* The more common way this happens is with impromptu ""fight clubs"" that only happen at a very narrow range of player levels where a host will invite players in to essentially duel.* Sometimes though, no one cares and you wind up summoned into a 3v1 where they just slaughter you, or it's a ""duel"" until someone decides it's not anymore. Impossible to know what place you've been summoned to beforehand.* Add all that to the several minutes it takes to actually get a connection to play with someone else, and you wind up with an hour of PVP mostly spent waiting around for a summon and getting ganged up 3v1 with virtually no chance.* Even coop PVE suffers from most of these issues, including hit reg that's so bad it is sometimes impossible for the non-host to damage enemies because of the server rolling back what you're seeing client-side, resulting in enemy health bars that just kinda oscillate when you hit them.In summary, this game is not at all designed for PVP and shoehorning it into this is a buggy, laggy mess of unplayable garbage. Which is a real shame, because the actual multiplayer aspect could have been fun if they just fixed a few of these trivial issues no video games since 2003 have had any problems with. I recommend DS2 instead.",0

Negative,"Going to have to thumbs this Game down(would Give it a Mixed rating if i could).And will explain why and my thoughts on this game.First off: Dark Souls 3 is a fantastic game, I had put more then 70+ hours in just the main Game/Story to beat it(2nd boss as well), And it is indeed a fantastic Action Rpg game(one of the best of 2016). Some Thing's i noticed in this game(small complaint):1: The poise System is pretty much non existent, So armor is pretty much for fashion after a certain point.2: Some delay in the controls(about a second deley when pressing the dodge button.ect).3: No way to turn of Vsync(Vsync causing Imput lag/delay). Why the thumb's down?The Online Security System: Well, This is where i start to hate how this game works, and The Main reason is ""THE SERVERS SECURITY"" And here is why(Console are excluded from this, as it's a PC thing). It seems the game will try to detect certain software as a Cheat/hack(like Controller or Recording softwares), Basically Causing a message ""Invalid Data"" and even if you delete your data(Completely All Save's and in Appdata), They will still ban you(Yes, They banned me for NO REASON) And, When you contact bandai they basically tell you off and wont do anything about it(As they don't control the servers). You Can't even use your PS4 controller(At the time you need ""Inputmapper"" to use it), Because as soon as you jump online for the first time when you want to Coop, it will harrass you. So, The whole Fromsoft Online security is REALLY crap And a dodgy system if bandai Can't control this. Out of the 498+ games i own, i would say This is the first time i experience this, And had a server security in a game this ""HORRIBLE"".And NO, For the last time, i would never Hack or cheat.(i have no reason to). Thing's i Noticed While Online: The main one is the Online invasions(only goes to people that does this), This seems to be common in the newbie area's, You're Basically Getting invaded as soon as you set foot in high wall of lothric(When You're around level 8-16). I Do not mind getting invaded(as long is it with legit items/gear). This is where the complaint come's into place, Is when People Who invade Are those with end game Items/Spells/flasks that insta heals, And Because of This, it pretty much ruins it for new players. And this is starting to become more common now(if you play online). Conclusion: Get this on CONSOLE.That is If you want to Co-op with a friend(that's why i went online, And had got this game as well). Because, the servers anti Hack/cheat system in this game is REALLY crap on PC, And it will treat your pc software like i mention above like one and ban you(My friend who i was cooping had just been banned as well, As we where using the same software/controller to play).Edit:They had unbanned me 3 weeks later after i tried to get in contact with them.Their systems are still really crappy on PC.",0
Negative,"no online support since January due to a discovery of a system compromising bug that allows attackers to launch executable on targets while joined on a Online Session. This server code is pretty much shared between all the PC ports, and probably Elden Ring. The slowness on patching this exploit hurts the community on these games.",0
Negative,"Do not get tempted to buy this by false promises or maybe even your own memories of the previous Souls Game s PvP. In it s current state PvP absolute shit. It is unbalanced, outright broken and full of completely retarded features that are abused by 99% of the community because some moronic Youtubers talk trash on Reddit and reveal these features to the players. Seriously 90% of the fucking players are using the Dark Sword or a Estoc its ridiculous. Poise is nonexistent while the praised ""Hyper Armor"" lets you combo other players to death effortlessly. If you want to desperately win take a UGS and spam R1 you cant be countered. Generally PvP was lessened to mindless R1 spam and the blind Miyazaki dickriders are even praising it while belittling Dark Souls 2 and the ""B-Team"".PVE and especially the bosses are a huge improvement to Dark Souls 2 and the only reason to buy this game. An average player s run takes about 40 hours. So it s your call if you want to sped your money on this game. If you re buying it for PvP that equals burning 60$.",0
Negative,"The community of this game is filled with toxic idiots, hardcore RPers, and very straight men looking to pound my ass with their +10 caestus.

Negative,"Don't play online! YOU WILL GET BANNED. Hackers are waiting in early areas of the game, summoning or invading as many new players as possible, and adding hacked items to their accounts to get people banned. I hope Bandai Namco didn't want any money from me ever again, because after something as shameful and inept as this hacking fiasco, they're not getting any.",0

In all honesty, good game if you like Dark Souls but soft banning innocent players for no reason is messed up so i'm not going to waste my time with a real review.

Bandai Namco is selling these games without telling people that the multiplayer is no longer available and there is no definite date for a fix.",0
Negative,"The game is broken, you can only play this game offline because if you play online, you might be invaded by a hacker who can auto-inject items into your inventory that causes the ban system to ban your account. The producers at Bandai and the devs Fromsoft have completely abandoned this game. It's only been 4 years, and they can't even do a simple patch to make things right. The game otherwise is a beautiful and fantastic game, but it's riddled with hackers trying to ruin the game.",0
Negative,"Off to pirate this as From Software decided im not allowed to continue playing online because they think i was cheating or more likely their history of useless PC ports now seems to recognize a 360 controller as a server-wide threat, asked for a refund as the product is no longer what i payed for and is ""unfit for the purpose of which it was sold for""Ive payed for the full game, not too be too annoyed but. id play lords of the fallen if i wanted a solo experience, Spent 90% of my online as a blue phantom, now im banned from online. Please other users post youre negative experiences if you've had any its not fair on the dent of the community that just got shat on.",0
Negative,I hate this fucking game with all my god damn heart. I would never recommend this game to a friend the pvp is very shit. You never fight anyone with normal fucking ping. You will always be matched up with an invader from across the planet with 6000000000000 ping. Even though ThErE iS A sETTing to TURN OFF THE CROSS REGION PLAY. Only people who play this shit ass game are those who love other men. In long story short Dark Souls 3 is a shit game ENJOY! - FromSoftware,0

Negative,"Keyboard and mouse are impossible to use, and i refuse to buy a xbox controller for 60 USD. Enjoyable until softban for using a controller emulator (X360CE) that literally makes the game playable. Will update review if FROM adresses the community regarding banning players for playying the game normally.EDIT: 5/11/16To random people that see this review and find my word untrustworthy. I highly suggest browsing the net and looking for yourself, Bandai Namco/FROM literally state online in multiple outlets that they consider any code injection a breach of EULA and therfore bannable. Specifically including controller emulation. Thus the only recourse is to buy a 60 dollar xbox controller rather than use the controllers that most budget gamers already have. To reiterate, FROM / BN are BANNING people from the online elements (read ""a huge portion"") of the game for using off brand controllers with a controller emulator rather than an overpriced games for windows controller. They KNOW that thats all that said people have done (upon examining their accounts supposedly) and they just state to said people that ""no one has ever been un-banned once banned"".Thats shite customer service on top of shoddy programming, and I for one view that as an insult. If i could refund this shit i would. Instead, i muck through in solo play. Till they deside to ban me from that too for using a ps3 controller knock off.",0
Negative,"The multiplayer servers went down a bit before Elden Ring's release due to an exploit and they are STILL down.This is a great game and I've played through it several times, but the whole exploit thing sucks. I got three of my friends to buy this game about a week before the servers went down, so now we can't play our new game together. We decided to just wait, because From Software announced that they would start working on a patch once Elden Ring was out.But it's been months. Within a week of the exploit going public, there was already a fan-made patch for it, so it's not even a hard fix.The part that bothers me the most is that Elden Ring is the only souls game that currently has multiplayer, which is pushing more sales for it. If me and my friends want to play one of these games together, we either have to wait months for the exploit to be patched or buy yet another $60 game. Call me crazy, but I think From is avoiding patching it for the sake of profits.EDIT: The servers are back up. Took them long enough.",0
Negative,"Absolotely completely BROKEN! I will change my review when this dreadfull PC port is patched, but they deserve a big thumbs down for stabbing their fans in the back like this!",0
Negative,DO NOT BUY! Game filled with cheaters. They summon with no warnings and enter boss rooms! And if you buy it play it offline.,0
Negative,"Not sure what I think about this game. The fact it has so many options and interesting combinations seems very attractive, but from my view, and it will be very unpopular, the combat system is trash. Very clunky and not at all enjoyable from my experience. A game I have to do hours of research to understand the meta to have the best chance of playing as a new player alone is taxing, let alone the fact that the controls aren't very responsive at all. It becomes frustrating quite quick. As punishing of a game as this is, unless you are a masochist, I'd probably pass on this one. Not one of those games you will sit down and enjoy for a few hours at a time.",0
Negative,"I would not recommend any of these games if you plan to play with friends. Invaders get way too much in their favor when it should be the other way around HEAVILY. They should have MAYBE 1-2 heal items or not be able to heal at all. Shouldn't be able to invade a new players game. There should be a tag that is associated with a new player that makes it so only other new players can invade new players games. I know all you purest shitbirds will come screaming ""just get gud"" or ""It's already not fair for the invaders"" blah blah blah. Firstly, just in general, there should be a setting that actually locks out invaders so you just play with your friends. Why have a password system if it's basically useless? Have it so you can set a password for invaders as well. Make it so they can't heal so damn much. FIX YOUR DAMN NETCODE IT'S TRASH. Among other things. I really want to like these games but right when I start having fun I get some neckbeard invader that has thousands of hours in the game that purposefully downgrades their gear because they know they can win against someone who just started playing the game. It's infuriating and definitely would be a reason I see a lot of people would stop playing before they actually get into enjoying it. Fix the netcode, put in a system that allows us to play with friends but blocks invaders, or just HEAVILY nerf invaders so it's a substantial uphill battle for them. They are there ruining your fun because ""haha lul get gud nerd I play this 5 year old game all day everyday to pwn noobs that just started the game haha"" Just do better please. If you guys added things like this your playerbase would increase drastically as I know several people that like the core of the game but absolutely loathe the invasion system. Again, call me a noob, tell me to get gud, whatever, I don't care about unwanted pvp in my games. If I wanna pvp I will play a game where that is all it is so it's actually balanced. Or on a pvp specific server for those games.",0

Negative,"[Caution] Your account has been penalized. Well looks like they're starting to ban players who didn't cheat. If you get hit by this ban you won't be able to play online with your friends. Sent bandai namco an email, hopefully they'll resolve this soon. Looked on reddit and seems like this will be a lengthy process. Gameplay 11/10.Service - Meh.Edit 2.28.2018The reply from customer services sums up to this: can't do crap. Everything is handled by Japan's server team and the American team is the middleman. The solution is to delete your character and wait a month or two before playing again or make a family share account through steam and still start over again.This ban puts you in a separate server for suspected cheaters, screwing you if you want to play with your buddies or if you're innocent. If you invade or get invaded by a hacker your data will be affected and you get banned. There's no compensation, you're just starting over with a big F you. Since I bought this throught the humble bundle can't even expect a refund. Thanks for reading my gripes, hopefully my bit of suffering will enlighten you to not purchase this awesome yet crappy game.Edit 3.21.2018Enjoyed a good three weeks playing on a family share account before getting banned running into a hacker.

Negative,"I love this game so much, but I cannot recommend it right now due to a major security vulnerability. If you want to play this game you should do so offline. Playing online could result in anything from hackers getting your account softbanned to exploiters fully bricking your PC or running unauthorized code on your machine. Great game but the developers need to fix this exploit asap. Still worth playing solo if you get the DLC on sale, ringed city is 10/10.",0
Negative,"Could never, ever connected to the server! single game forever! Free pirated players can even play with each other together, so what did I pay the money for? Honored to be a victim of authorised offical paid game? Dumbass!",0
Negative,"Despite enjoying all of my time in game I can't really recommend this with the approach they take when restricting people from their game. I played the first couple days a few hours each in coop with my friend who I also bought the game for, and had no issues. We died to bosses, we died in invasions, we died on enemies we had previously beaten because we got overconfident, and basically we seemed right on track with the experience we expected of this game.Then on the third or fourth day, my main screen is flagged with ""INVALID GAME DATA"" has been detected and yatta yatta. I still don't know what the Invalid data was because it gave no indications as to what was actually invalid. Things I tried.* Deleting my current character with 16 hours invested. Annoying but okay. I continued playing online with a character from scratch, and my coop buddy helped me run through all the previous areas until we caught up again.*Installing game on another hard drive in case it was a hard disk problem on my end. My internet is slow, and it takes 10-15 hours to download, so this was my last resort. *Verifying integrity of game cache. Now it would seem to me if you get an error because ""INVALID GAME DATA"" this would be a pretty sure way to fix it. So I run this, and sure enough 1 file fails to validate. I'm thinking, ""Oh hey, here's my problem right here! Kinda douchebaggy to accude me of breaking their ToS because something didn't download right, but at least it's fixed now, and I don't have to worry."" Wrong.1 file fails to validate, and the game starts download 10.6 GB of data. The whole game is like 18GB, are you telling me a single file is that big? I felt it was bullcrap, but I let it do it's thing for the next 7 hours, and then when it totally finishes it slaps me with an error, ""Update File Corrupt""This is the reason I had to totally reinstall the game because there was absolutely no other choice now that my whole install was corrupted, and validating game files now resulted in it finishing in 1 second saying all files were validated, and hitting play resulted in downloading that same 10.6 GB of data across 7 hours which I did THREE times. to get the ""Update file corrupt"" problem again.So I reinstall the entire game, and wonder of wonders it works, and I start the game, and am met with ""YOU HAVE BEEN PENALIZED"" Are you serious From Soft? I can't help it your game broke. I carried on trying to believe it was my fault, but it's not. It's a bad system. After checking around this apparently means I'll be put in a matchmaking pool with other people who have been penalized. Which if it happens to everyone as easily as it did me, probly won't be so bad since I imagine just about everyone will have been penalized by now.The main reason this loss even affects me, is I have a coop buddy who I bought the game specifically to play through with, and we won't even be able to that since he isn't penalized(for now anyways.) If it weren't for coop with him I would just play offline since I have no interest in PVP. Normally when we're doing coop the two of us will get invaded by a single guy who kills us anyways, but we wasn't even mad, that's just part of the game. He's better than both of us so he wins 9/10 times.My problem comes from a total lack of transparency. It woulda been nice for them to tell me what this supposely ""Invalid data"" was so I could actually remove it and keep on playing.So overall, if you're gonna buy this game for any of the online features, I'd advise against it. The single player is pretty fun, though it's a lot more fun coop, but people can get treated unfairly a little too easily for my tastes.",0

It looks like shit but at least the thing fucking works.",0
Negative,"This is my favorite game however I cannot recommend it anymore. It's always been filled with bugs and exploits that From never cared to fix. The community has done more for fixing this game than From ever has. They wouldn't do anything about hackers and so the some in the community made a mod called blue sentinel that helped protect you from them. When the RCE exploit was discovered, those same modders from the community had a fix within a day. What does From do? Shut the servers down and they're still down for the entire trilogy nearly two months later.",0
Negative,"I can see why this game is considered to be great, but it was also a very frustrating experience for me, in large part by design. Despite all the bad I have to say about DS3, if I could have a ""maybe"" option, I'd pick that, because DS3 is obviously meant for some people out there.For context, I went a primarily-faith build, so I have decent exposure to both melee combat and spell-casting. It took me about 40 hours, finished the base game at level 90, I believe both of those metrics are about average. Not sure if I'll bother with the DLC, but my point is I finished the game, so my problems aren't because I didn't git gud.The TL;DR of this is that DS3 basically met my expectations: this game puts being difficult ahead of being fun.First, the good. The boss fights are fantastic, the only thing keeping me going. Absolutely not overhyped. The music was also fantastic, and the world-building and build diversity are good. If you enjoyed this game, you'll find a lot of different builds to try out.Now, onto what I didn't like. This will surely be subjective in large part, but these reasons are why I'm not going to replay DS3 or try other games in the series.The combat system here is the opposite of another game they made, Sekiro. Whereas Sekiro is very narrow but deep, DS3 is very wide and shallow. DS3 may have more replayability, but DS3's combat was so limited in comparison that I have no desire to replay by the time I was done. I found DS3's combat to be clunky and not enjoyable at all, and how my character controls is the biggest factor in determining my enjoyment of a game.The world, while cool in theory and lore, looked abysmal. It was too damn dark all the time. I strained my eyes whenever I played this, and turning up the brightness to fix it washed everything out. I get that DS3 is meant to be dark, but I've never felt such strain playing a game before.The RPG system is more a neutral than a con, but I'll talk about it here anyways. My character felt like crap until I got to about level 40. Over 1/3 of the time I played this, I didn't like my character. Sure, I started to like him later, but 15+ hours is a long time to think ""When am I going to actually like my own character?""The save points (bonfires) were a huge negative for me too. At a minimum, every boss should have an accessible save point nearby - if you're too concerned that makes the bosses too easy, make them harder, but it's not fun trying to learn a boss, dying, then spending 1-2 minutes running back, hoping you don't get hit along the way. The final boss was my favorite in part because I got to focus on just killing it, not doing some dumb trek back past the same 10 skeletons every time.Also, no cloud saves, so don't clean your computer without manually backing it up (lost a 10-hour save due to that).All in all, the Dark Souls series just isn't for me. I beat the whole game so I could make sure my issues weren't because I couldn't beat it, plus I 100%ed Sekiro (one of my favorite games ever now that I checked that out too). The biggest issues were the poor combat and frustrating checkpoints, both of those made me want to rush this game as fast as I could. It's still a great game, in spite of all the trash I talked, just know that it's not for everyone, not even for all hardcore gamers.",0

Negative,I've been playing this game for a while now and it's good but I can't recommend it as From Software have completely neglected the player base.

If the game works great for you it won't for long or you're simply lucky.I do really enjoy the faster paced combat and weapon arts. Hate to say anything positive tbh considering my extreme level of disappointment with what happened at launch. For me, the problem is a memory leak issue with the game causing fps drop and freezes with others reporting this as well, game runs smooth (not DS2 perfect though) when I have no other program open on my comp.From Software needs to learn how to make games for PC. Dark Souls had a shit ton of problems at launch as well. You think they would have learned from their mistakes.I am playing and having fun with DS3 for the most part, although so far it is the worst in the series mainly due to small, lame, level design and Bloodbourne copied enemies, it is the most poorly optimized game on the planet atm.What a slap in the face overall, seriously. I'll never buy another From title for more than 10 bucks. Fool me once with DS2 and DS2.5, and again with DS3's beyond horrible launch.never again.",0

Negative,"The game is excellent but I can't recommend it in for 2 reasons:- The servers are down since several months, we don't know for how much time. They fixed the security vunerabilitie(s) swiftly for Elden Ring, but can't seem to do it in a few months for the others souls. So you'll essentially buy a downgrade version of the original game, without the player's messages and PVP- Since Elden Ring success, the price of the other souls games increased a bit (that's greedy, but whatever). But as of today 22/04/2022, I see that Dark Souls 3 is at 60 . for a 6 years old game missing a good chunk of its content? Wtf? I really hope it's a bug.So yes, again, the game is excellent but I obviously can't recommend it in its current state",0
Negative,"Fromsoft doesn't care about pc players so there's no cheat prevention.

You can find it on nexusmods. Please spread the word about it, ideally everyone should use it as it fixes what fromsoft didn't fix (including a major vulnerability that can potentially let actual hackers fiddle with your pc).",0
Negative,"I love this game , but unfortunately I can't recommend it for pvp (pve in this game is amazing it's a 10/10). The state of pvp in 2022 is just very very very bad and infuriating, because 80% of the player base that remained are like a venom that course through the barely alive veins of this game. You will fight these ""amazing"" players that are 100% passive with a rotten ghru or pkcs or a dagger that will never attack first and just want you to attack first so they can outspace your attack and than punish it . And if you are like me a ""non-meta"" guy that uses claymore, fg, red hilted halberd etc, you will have a bad time . Another problem is cheating/exploiting . For exploits we have (estus cancel/fap glitch/bow glitch/rkss cancel) that are all broken and give the user a massive advantage, and the cheating problem in this game is massive ( from ragehacks to closet cheating to ""quality of life"" cheating ) : ragehacks : i didn't find a lot of people that toggled against me , but a day I found a ""good"" (a parasite) player that ran ghru curved sword and I was on the verge of winning when he hard swaps to gundyr's , gets me with the wa. I was on the floor and he immediately goes into a second wa that gets me while I was still on the floor, and btw when he did the first wa I hit him with an r1 that did no damage for some reason. So here I will stop my little rant, and I'm sorry that I coudn't cover everything. If there smth important that I might have missed pls tell me in the comments.",0

Negative,"With the lack of online play and the patch not having arrived for a month now, I would not recommend this game. The game is good on its own but a chunk of the content is just missing, including the online contributions like blood stains and messages from other players. It adds a lot more to the game than you'd think, knowing you're not alone in your struggles. I hope the fix comes soon but I imagine the devs are more consumed with Elden Ring than anything else. It almost feels like they cut down on the support for Dark Souls 3 intentionally to bolster sales and support for Elden Ring. Seeing as it's been an entire month and Dark Souls 3 is still entirely offline, it sure as hell feels that way.Will change the review when the patch comes through, but can't in good faith recommend it in its current state.",0

Anticheat is trash if it bans the victim and not the perpetrator. Can't even get a refund now, either.",0
Negative,"I have no choice but to not recommend this game, because it may be a good game, but it's a garbage pc port. If you play with a controller it's acceptable, but that should not be a requirement for a PC game. The controls are extremely jank with mouse and keyboard, with problems such as your viewpoint being forcibly locked in place after certain attacks, temporarily locking onto enemies on it's own if you aren't using the lock-on feature, several actions that can't be rebound, (such as sprint, which seems locked to spacebar even if I want it on shift.) Not to mention that the instructions including all the menu options and tutorials exclusively show controller inputs, even if no controller is plugged in. All in all, this leads to lots of 'bullshit' deaths where it feels like you have no control of what's happening. Go pick this game up for PS4 instead, and pick up a copy of bloodbourne while you're at it to justify the buy if you need to buy a console to do that.",0

Negative,"I love this game so much. I Really do. but i can't give it a positive review because of recent events. Server have been down for about 3 months now and The games are still being advertised as co-op, but they aren't anymore. It seems as though the Devs are not going to keep the servers going, which, don't get me wrong i understand to some degree, but this game still has a big, active fan-base, so it doesn't make sense to shut the servers down. unless. they are doing it to make people buy and play Elden Ring. The servers where shut down due to an exploit, but it was fixed very quickly. why are the servers still down 3 months in? There has been NOTHING from the devs regarding this except ""servers won't be online until after the release of Elden Ring"" and it just seems scummy and sketchy.There are some absolutely ridiculous people commenting defending the devs, asking why people are still playing Dark Souls 3 when Elden Ring is out. It's such a dumb comment because they are literally different games, with different achievements, bosses, multiplayer aspects and the maps are different. Just because a new game is released, it should force people to stop playing their older games. Stop saying these dumb things.It seems like once again, one of my favourite developers are just doing everything they can to make money, and screwing the consumer. I really hope this is not the case, but i can't give a positive until this is sorted out.",0

It has performance issues anyway. Please fix your games, thanks. We, as customers (or paypigs for some of the games), need to voice our displeasure if the game doesn't deliver what they promise.

Negative,BEWARE! Hacker has taken over this game. I play all of the dark souls series and have more hr on some of them if you count my Xbox days. I have 200hr in dark souls 3. The game is amazing and I only recommend this game in offline mode only. But I got hacked when I was in the undead settlement and sent me to the very start. If you fight a hacker they will reset your save game and ruin your save game. They might be able to do other things on your system but that is not confirmed. Overall if you only play offline mode only you are going still love this game it might be my favorite game series of all time. If you still want to play online download the mod blue sentinels.

NO COST? and plus armor is among the easiest item to find in this game even in the first area 'the throne of the lord of darkness"" there is so much armor and it is incredibly high level, S rank or and all of the weapons do NO DAMAGE. you heard me right NO DAMAGE AT ALL. this is enickslusable for a game of this calibur, especaly after playing sekiro where you have so much damage and you can youse your sword to parry attacks and block intuitively. overall this game isgood but held back by rollback netcode and broken armor",0
Negative,"Don't buy right now. Too expensive for an 8 year old game. $60 for the game plus another $20 for the dlc. Servers are down, even though they said it would be fixed after elden ring was launched, which is hilarious because modders have already fixed the issues with hackers.If you're looking at getting this in 2022 and beyond, buy it on sale. Nothing less than 50% off, and use the mod that allows for custom servers. It's a great game beyond the servers and the price.P.S. I have nothing against a new game being the they're at, but an 8 year old game being this price is too much. It reminds me of Activision.",0
Negative,"Dark Souls III could have been a great game if it weren't for the invasions.Playing offline is fine, but oh? What's that? You just want to play online with a friend? Well, have fun getting raped in the ass by unwanted invaders! Hmm? You don't want to get randomly invaded every 10 seconds? Too bad. You don't have a choice.You're thinking: ""Well, I got invaded, but hopefully they'll at least be honorable."" Nope, they never are. They'll just keep running away, using the NPC enemies as backup because they're too bad to fight you on their own. They'll heal 15 times and keep running.It's a lose-lose situation; either you'll die and get reset to the last bonfire without your ember, or you'll finally kill them, having lost all of your Estus Flasks and even worse, 30 minutes of your life. Honestly, how the invaders get any ""fun"" out of this is beyond me.Maybe if PvP was an option that you could toggle on or off it could be fun, but suddenly getting attacked by ""Lou Sassole"" while you and your friend are messing around 5 meters before the next unlit bonfire (which you can't light until the invader is gone, by the way) is agony.Playing with a friend should not turn an enjoyable game into suffering.Don't get me wrong it's a fun game, that is, until you get invaded.So, to all invaders I would like to say: Please, do the world a favor, and off yourselves.",0

Negative,"This game (and the series alike) is very overrated. Every aspect of Dark Souls 3 is subpar and uninteresting. It's the epitome of ""A mile wide and an inch deep."" Everything it does is done to a far better degree by other RPGs. The combat: Nioh 2 and the Ninja Gaiden Sigma series are games which have similar weapon variety but much more depth to it's combat mechanics. The most interesting the combat can get in Dark Souls 3 is pressing the attack button or the roll button. Of course you can block (lol) or use the special ability of the weapon which will be most likely be useless except for some standout cases. The combat is sooooo boring and watered down compared to any other ""soulslike."" The spellcasting is also very lame since you have sacrifice your only resource of health in the game for it, and bosses in the late game actively discourage that playstyle anyway.The World is also really boring as well. For a game where every boss is a named character and all your companions have these mini arcs, FromSoft has a really hard time making me care about any of them. Out of all the characters I think I only really cared about 2 of the nonboss ones. The ending is also so entrenched in the bad world building that it makes it hard for me to care about what happened in this world. Some of the bosses are interesting but a lot of them are really uninspired and if you have any familiarity with this type of game, you should be able to beat them pretty quickly. The exploration and secrets are probably the only thing that I think Dark Souls does well, but still lacking compared to other RPGs with not even half the budget.The most impressive thing about Dark Souls is that it's able to have very bare bones and watered down versions of all of these mechanics in one single game. A mile wide but an inch deep.",0
Negative,"So I've played a lot of this. And it's weird, after all this time I still wouldn't really recommend it to most people. My first gripe is the difficulty, which even with over 70 hours of playtime under my belt I usually find more of a hindrance to my enjoyment than anything. It's dangerously close to ""be perfect or else you lose"", especially if you're any sort of caster. It definitely doubles down on the one-shot kills too, which I always thought just killed enjoyment. It's not so much enlivening and pulse-pounding to me as much as annoying and draining. And not only that, but when it should be most challenging, envigorating, and memorable near the end of the game, it just kind of peters out, reusing old enemies and ideas over and over again. Semi-SPOILER the last non-boss challenge in the game is just a bunch of the same knights and soldiers you were fighting in the first few hours of the game, only more of them and with higher stats. And that's after an entire area filled with nothing but reused enemies. Ick. END semi-SPOILER.Now the constant difficulty wouldn't be so bad if not for my second and main gripe, that the game is massively, massively linear compared to previous entries in the series. There aren't even a handful of meaningful branching paths. Which is sad, because that was one of the saving graces of the series for me. For Dark Souls 2 when people would say ""oh I don't want to play it, I don't like games to be that hard"", I could tell them that at any time there are 2 or 3 paths they could take instead of the one they're on, so if something is giving them trouble they can try something else out instead, then get stronger and come back. It keeps it fresh and lets you avoid the frustration of just being stuck on a really hard boss that you're fricking BORED or ticked off with but that you just can't seem to beat. Well that whole mechanic is gone, dead. It's no longer a metroidvania game like the first two. With a few exceptions there's nowhere to really explore except the area you're currently in at the moment. And actually, with only a single exception the places where you can take branching paths are secrets, not even part of the main game. It's just a straight line from beginning to end. For me, that's a huge disappointment, and seems pretty lazy when they've taken time to do that in the past.So I guess I'd recommend it if you're 100% only in it for the combat, which is excellent, and the difficulty. If you mainly wanted a metroidvania-style tough as nails exploration game like I did, like the second one was, with a criss-crossing critical path and the ability to make meaninful choices about where to go next and not just get spoon-fed areas and bosses in a linear fashion, this is not it. Disappointing, and not recommended unless you're a masochist or simply a lover of the combat.*Update: I had the urge to retry this since the Elden Ring trailer came out. My opinion hasn't changed. I don't understand why anyone feels compelled to spend their time playing this. I think I've been sick of grimdark settings for about 10 years now, too, that doesn't help. I didn't enjoy Sekiro, either. I think I'm just done with this guy's games. I hope everyone enjoys Elden Ring.",0

Negative,"The game could be very good.Unfortunately the publisher does nothing against hackers who ruin the game. On the contrary, you can even be banned yourself if a hacker joins the game and puts invalid items into your inventory without doing anything yourself.

Even had one hacker teleport the greatwood boss in an attempt to kill me, but the game instantly killed the boss as it was moved outside of the boss arena, locking me out of a specific covenant.Additionally, If you google this game to find information about the various exploits, in May of 2021 it was discovered that a new game exploit allows hackers to corrupt and delete your save file.

Negative,"I personally enjoyed this game a lot, and I still do, but there are just way too many problems (major and minor) that seem to go overlooked for the longest time. While I understand that they want to completely forget Dark Souls 2's existence, they refuse to learn from the good that it did, while also completely getting rid of what made the original Dark Souls so popular; difficulty. Rolling is now based around spamming rather than timing, and considering the low cost, there's absolutely no drawback to mashing the roll button 20 times, as you'll regain your stamina within seconds. I could go on for hours over what's wrong with this game, but the most painful thing of all, though, is how they barely listen to their Western fans, almost always pandering to the East's. Even the Region Lock is essentially for Japan only, as there's only 2 real ""regions,"" Japan and Not Japan.

Negative,"This is something of a sad thing to say, but I can't really recommend this game at it's current Price, or it's DLCs, not unless they're less than $30 at least.I'll try to describe in Detail why this game isn't very good, from both a PvP and a PvE aspect as best I can, so let's start with PvE.} Baser PvE enemies: In Dark Souls 3 PvE, the game at first, doesn't seem too different from many other games of an RPG Genre, very basic enemies staggered by your weapon, they don't have very powerful weapons or tools to defeat you with but you have to play careful or be overwhelmed, very fair and basic stuff, so it's not very much so worth getting into, what's really worth getting into is later-game, wherein enemies actually deal fair damage to you. In mid-game enemies still try to overwhelm you, though now they move much faster and their weapon strikes are almost always faster than yours, this can lead to unfair fights wherein if you begin to get over-tasked, you may not be able to get away before getting killed in combat because you simply can't move or the enemies lash out at you far too quickly for you to heal, this can be frustrating to deal with at first if you're going through the game alone, however this problem can be solved if you simply bait them out one at a time. In late-game, though there is a mix of a few newer enemies, for some reason they simply re-use the exact same enemies you fought earlier, only harder hitting and maybe a new technique or 2, but otherwise pretty well the same, any tactic you used on the enemies at the beginning of the game, which makes it ridiculously easy to simply walk up to them and smash your Light-attack button because your swings will almost always knock them out of any of their attacks, the only reason you'd have to stop is to regain Stamina so you can repeatedly swing your weapon again. This truly baffles me, as in previous games, from the Souls Series, I have never seen re-use of enemies on this scale, and likely for good reason, so as to make you learn new tactics for each area and make them more memorable. It is also very apparent that the tactic you use to beat Beginning level enemies can also be used to beat almost every enemy up until Mid-Game where they begin to get faster than you.TL/DR: Enemies are somewhat poorly made PvE Bosses: The very coveted Dark Souls Bosses. The bosses for Dark Souls 3 are mostly well made, save for some exceptions, which can be quite the annoyance or completely disappointing. This shor bit is going to list off some poorly made Bosses, so skip reading this if you don't want to be spoiled, but know that it's roughly 45/55 on how I personally feel about Bosses. #1 Deacons of the Deep#2 High Lord Wolnir#3 Yhorm the GiantLastly, #4 Dancer of the Boreal Valley This is just something of a detailed list of bosses that were poorly done but were mandatory, if they weren't mandatory they wouldn't be worth mentioning in my opinion.TL/DR: 1/4 of bosses are badNumber of Bosses/Time to beat: Discussing the bosses also makes it apparent there are less bosses than the previous two Souls series games, With Dark Souls 2 having a bare minimum of 20-16 bosses if you use Shortcuts and skips and Dark souls 1 having 14 bosses if you use every shortcut and skip device available to you. This is another point Dark Souls 3 has against it, considering 4 of it's 13 are unimpressionable bosses, which isn't neccesarily something I can say about about the others in the previous games. This can also considerably reduce the time to beat the game.TL/DR: Less Bosses than previous games, thus making game quicker to beatPvE and Combat:Another thing worth mentioning is that many weapons in PvE are unviable, the only things you'll usually every need are a Dark Sword or an Ultra-Great weapon, using anything else is usually more of a challenge, and you'll often see this is usually what people are using when playing Co-Operativley or during Invasions. This removes a lot of personality from characters, because not many people will sacrifice personal taste for damage, though every weapon should be reasonably good.TL/DR: No good reason for PvE weapon varietyCo-Operataive play and Host Benefits: Lastly, Co-Operative play and Host Bonus's in Dark Souls 3 makes it ridiculously easy. In regards to summoning: Now, don't get me wrong, this is true in every Souls-Game, however in this one, every enemy except for some bosses can be VERY easily staggered, meaning that if you bring 2 or 3 extra players into your game, you can usually just carelessly swing your weapon with abandon, as any enemy that comes into contact with a hit will be unable to move until they recieve a second hit, letting your and your friends keep whacking it in an infinite cycle. If you haven't somehow managed to kill it and your summons haven't taken the aggresion from the enemy, you have a large plethora of Estus and lots of Rolls to be able to survive almost anything, along with a 25% health increase to help you survive more lethal attacks. This in totallity means you can simply mow down enemies with your pals and never think about attacking Human-Sized foes and makes you sloppy at fighting bosses because all you've likely had to do is spam light-attack and you'll likely beat most bosses by summoning too.TL/DR: Summoning+Being a Host makes game no challenge at all A few other short things: Dark Souls 3 Re-uses a LOT of Assets from previous games.For some reason a some magics were added from previous games and others were not at all. Moving on to PvP Invasions: In Dark Souls, there is a mechanic unique to it that you likely won't find in many other games, the ability to invade and combat people during their PvE experience. This being said, Dark Souls 3 has pretty well ruined this mechanic, with the previously mentioned Host Benefits and Co-Operative play and the ability to also stagger Invading players like regular enemies, this allows the Host and his phantoms to have an overwhelming advantage against invaders unless an invader uses only combat builds designed to kill other players in a single hit (Also known as Glass Cannons). Also in Dark Souls 3 was the inclusion of moving while using the healing item Estus, making it nearly impossible to punish another player who has run away and is currently healing because they can just walk out of punishments. With all this, there is no good reason to Invade in Dark Souls 3, it's literally been ruined to an almost unrecognizable degree, especially if you've played the previous Dark Souls games.TL/DR: They've Soiled It Duels : Duels in Dark Souls 3 are okay, though there's clear superiority in what weapons you should use, and Heavy armor is absolutely pointless.Now, I know there are some people who might be wondering what some above average things are about this game, so let me give you a brief summary of those: ~Dark Souls 3 Positives~ Soundtrack: By Jove, the Soundtrack is amazing, even for some of the lesser Bosses, it really gives you a feel for what you're fighting and puts you in the moment. Art: This one is a bit generalized, but I mean things like the armors, the Backgrounds and some areas, which clearly have a goodly bit of detail put into them, some of these clearly have had a lot of work put into them. Good Bosses: Now I spent a good paragraph listing off how I dislike some of the bosses in Dark Souls 3, but there are some VERY good bosses in this game, that will no doubt enamour you (Make sure to do hidden Bosses if you do get this game) Wrapping up I'd love to go into more detail about some of these things but reviews can only be so long, so I'll just tell you my final score for Dark Souls 3 is a 5/10 and with it's DLC it's a 6/10. Again, I recommend buying it when it's cheap on price, or if you just wanna say you beat Dark Souls",0

I did not play Demon Souls or Scholar of the First Sin or any of the DkS2 DLC.This game is great in so many ways and improves on a lot of the features of previous Souls titles from crafting to unlocking spells, weapons, and other purchasables, and even brings the player back to a Dark Souls feel for combat and character control compared to Dark Souls 2, including the i-frames on dodge rolls not being nearly as few as they were in Dark Souls 2.All the praises I could give to Dark Souls 3 are unfortunately thrown out the window due to some critical flaws in the game's design. Let's start with some of your first experiences in the game.Minor Spoilers for the first boss fight, nothing story-related, but you've been warned.First boss, Iundex Gundyr - Pretty easy and very enjoyable first phase, really gives you hope for what the rest of the game offers. Second phase? Explodes into a giant black mess of goop that covers your entire screen and is near-impossible to read. I actually managed to beat him on my first try, but it required all estus flasks and I had a sliver of health left. This was a warning for how the game design policy had evolved, which I flatly ignored. I feel like I got pretty lucky getting away from that fight unscathed. It also helped that I started as a Warrior, so I had a decent health pool and good starting damage. My gf chose Deprived and struggled significantly more with the boss than I did.Early-Game Estus FlasksSo, they decided to carry over the DkS2 style of Estus Flasks, where you start the game with very few estus flasks, and it takes a while to build that amount up and certainly to, beyond that, make them effective with bone shards. I don't even want to imagine what it must be like as anyone who relies on FP because you also have to allot your estus flasks. Sounds like a great idea for late-game and PvP absolutely, but you're going to be very frustrated as many early zones feel like a game of attrition as you're trying to explore and collect all the items so you don't have to come back later after you're well past that area in the game to grab a few things that were probably more useful earlier in your playthrough.Especially with how much more damage enemies have started to do in DkS2 and DkS3, and many other BS things they added, your main concern should really be whether or not you can survive individual engagements or coordinated encouters such as ambushes, rather than worrying about your estus flask management in early zones. You will probably find yourself using homeward bones at least once in the first three zone before finding your next bonfire for the fear of losing all your soul progression.Enemy BS in a variety of formsLots of enemies have been designed to make the game unfair for you. While most people have a misconception about Dark Souls games, I recall Dark Souls 1 to be a refreshingly challenging experience. It was hard not because it was designed to be unfair, but because that kind of challenge was new to me. You're an undead fighting Kings, Dragons, and borderline Gods, you're supposed to hurt, but as my 5th grade teacher properly dichotimized the terms of ""hard"" and ""challenging,"" whenever someone would complain that something in the class was hard; Something that's ""challenging"" is by no means insurmountable, and something that is ""hard"" is not made to be broken, it's made to withstand every blow it takes.So, the first instance of some serious BS in the game is the black goop enemies you fight in the first zone, and occasionally further on in the game. Much like Iundex Gundyr, they take up your entire screen, but they also have massively wide arcs in their attacks and are near-impossible to read. Now, you can certainly kill these enemies before they explode into black gore and personified frustration, it was not something I was ever favorable enough to do, and some starting classes may have more difficulty than even I did in accomplishing this.Enemy Tracking is another great piece of BS they decided to exarcerbate in this iteration of the Dark Souls universe. Some bosses will share this trait as well, which is very disconcerting, but you'll notice a lot of enemies whose attacks will track your character during the entirety of the attack animation. This makes it very difficult to dodge or position yourself with dodge rolls or normal movement and is nothing less than artificial difficulty that will leave you tightening the grip on your controller every time you die to an enemy that will spin 180 degrees around towards the end of his attack animation to catch you after your dodge roll finished because you thought, as with every other Souls game, dodging early to gain a positional advantage and allowing yourself for a large enough window to punish enemies was the smart thing to do. Not in this game. You are forced to dodge roll as they complete their attacks, especially if you want to dodge the follow-ups which will also track you, and this makes your punish windows much smaller in this game for no logical reason other than to try and market the ""challenge"" of Dark Souls.Too Much Poise! A lot of zones will have some signature enemies that are made memorable for their challenge or unique mechanics. However, this neat concept is bastardized by making powerful or cool enemies, especially those with fast attacks and very little down-time between those attacks, have incredibly high poise. Even as an UltraGS user, I had difficulty poise-breaking a lot of enemies. One of the greatest examples of this are the Goat Monkey Fire Sorcerers in Demon Ruins. They can take a fully-charged R2 from the Profaned Greatsword and still retaliate without flinching.No Input-QueueingYup, no input-queueing. That's great, right? A step in the right direction for DkS3.except.it's not. Input-Queueing was actually insanely useful in previous Souls games. You just had to stop spamming and know that your character will do what you want it to. The importance of input-queueing actually exists in the reaction time it offers. Life or Death comes down to fractions of a second in Souls games, and input-queueing makes it so your input will activate at the next possible opportunity. As long as you know the game and trust your inputs and don't button-mash, you will be better than okay. In Dark Souls 3, removing input-queueing means you have to button-mash in order to react on the first possible frame. You know how you have to button-mash to get the roll or backstep at the bottom of a long fall to avoid the momentary stagger? Imagine doing that all the time on all bosses or enemies that combo you or poise-break you or knock you down, or.anything! It's very uncomfortable and, in my opinion and people may disagree, less skillful.Ironically, the only semblance of input-queueing is in dodgerolls. This was definitely one of the biggest peeves in Dark Souls 1, no pun intended, of anyone who played was the random dodgeroll. It's not quite as bad in this game, but if you try to dodgeroll an attack but get hit before the dodgeroll executes and are poise-broken, often times on boss fights, you stagger and then dodgeroll after the poise-break ends. This becomes a very huge problem because a lot of bosses in DkS3 are designed so that they combo in specific intervals to counter people who spam evade. The follow-ups last just long enough that they hit you after your dodgerolls ends if you dodge reflexively to being hit once. That is really smart and enjoyable gameplay, but when your dodge is queued after eating the first hit and you are forced into a ""reflexive dodge"" you didn't intend to perform, the boss gets 2 free hits of damage onto you, and then you could very well be dead.",0

Negative,"6 year old game still $60 and now with no servers, what a deal!",0
Negative,Fucking atrocious console controls.From Software clearly haven't been near a computer.,0
Negative,"There is no Power Stance like in DS2 and thus limiting the freedom of choosing which weapons you want to combine into a power stance, which for me was one of the best mechanic ever.Now you have like 2-3 set of weapons that are already combined which is also neat but doesn't give you as much freedom.else pretty solid game, still thumbsdown amk",0

Negative,"editing to a negative review, at this point the servers are just offline s[o they can pump elden ring numbers, they have now permanently damaged their fanbase for money, hooray.",0
Negative,"Multiplayer is broken and FromSoft has moved their workforce to Elden Ring.Aquire a 'free trial' to play the singleplayer if you must, don't buy it.",0
Negative,"this game is too artificially difficult, no skill involved whatsoever. you just run into the bosses death after death hoping from them to use an actual dodgeable pattern of attacks and then you win with 0 satisfaction. would not recommend to anyone besides wannabee e-sports teenagers",0
Negative,Worst port I've ever seen. Developers should feel ashamed to release this.,0
Negative,Cheater reset my progress the second they joined my game. Blue Sentinel mod was useless.,0
Negative,"21:9 Widescreen support broken on launch day patch. Don't bother purchasing this if you were planning on playing this game in 21:9 before some hack gets released, or they patch what they broke.Another sad day.",0
Negative,"I can't recommend this game to anyone anymore. It was my favorite, I have over a thousand hours. From Software is just a disgusting example of not caring about their fans. They don't need me? I don't need them. No multiplayer is just boring. Do not waste your money.",0
Negative,too many souls,0
Negative,Imagine not fixing servers :/,0
Negative,No multiplayer in a soul game.SOVLLESS,0
Negative,"Such a lazy rehash of Dark Souls 1 and Dark Souls 2 assets. Pretty boring exploration, some interesting bosses. Who bought this at full price? A lot of locations are best just ran through than interacted with since it's so tiresome.If you really want it, despite the online being down for a few months already - buy it with heavy discount.",0
Negative,Dark souls three? More like dark souls poop and pee,0
Negative,"Feels like a worse version of Dark Souls I, less connected and more linear. Soulless",0
Negative,"FromSoft just removed family sharing for this game. Huge mistake. Now my friends who had to create another account and then share this game to their alt account because some hacker dropped them broken items, banning their accounts, cant even play with me. And theyre completely innocent. They didnt know any better, theyre new to the game. This was a bad move on FromSoft's end. Now we're all going to stop playing because we cant play together. I soon foresee the ""banned"" servers becoming the new vanilla servers as literally anyone could be banned from hackers breaking your character data that you cant do anything about.",0
Negative,"So far kind of a disappointment, I know I will still play it but the controls are sadly still shit. As well, the games already crashed and I keep getting issues with my player running in a particular direction until i press the key that causes it. Hopefully we'll get a hotfix for some of it :/ I do know though that the controls are never going to be optimized for computer, nor are they going to put in the extra hour to alter all the tutorial messages with the keys on the pc either.",0
Negative,"Fine setting, quirky yet responsive combat system, weird difficulty spikes.-1 for cultist toxic community around the series.Overrated.",0
Negative,Poopyyyy pc servers have been down for how long now smh,0
Negative,This game does not include PC control prompts. I don't know who makes a AAA title like this and expects EVERYONE to use controllers. I didn't play DS 2 because of this exact thing. It is total BS.,0
Negative,Fix the online.,0
Negative,Fuck Invading. This mechanic is literally so fucking dumb. There should be a way other than launching in offline mode to disable invading. I am just trying to enjoy the god dam game when this asshole keeps repeatadly invading me and its literally so god dam tilting.,0
Negative,loss of a huge chunk of my life in multiple saves on my family share you cunts have now stole from be after being unjust banned on this one and having family share now deactivated. you also did some rather sneaky small hat shareholder things when you only removed family share after steam sale.,0
