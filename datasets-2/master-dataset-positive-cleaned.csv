Positive,"a masterpiece. If you play the game you will understand why I call it a masterpiece. It's impossible to explain with words. You can only know by feeling it. You can only know by playing and being consumed by the dark souls universe. You will ultimately become a better person the second you launch this game. I suffer from an addiction called league of legends. I was a terrible person when I played that trash game. It gave me major depression from being hardstuck gold 3 19LP. Dark Souls has changed my life for the better. It has made me better at communicating with women and ever since I launched the game nothing has come to me but pure joy and happiness. I have gotten married to the woman of my dreams. I have also started a family and I am going to get my daughter into dark souls once she is old enough. I will never let this game die as long as I live. Dark Souls is truly an amazing experience that you do not want to miss out on. It will bring you so much joy and fortune. I have never been happier, and I haven't played league in a very long time now. I dont even have the urge or temptation to even install the game. I think that if smokers played dark souls they would forget about smoking. They wouldn't even want to take time out of their day to smoke when they can just play dark souls 3",1

Positive,"I don't usually write reviews because most people couldn't even bother to read them. Despite this, I would say that this is an amazing game that is surprisingly dead for how good it is!Dark Souls III was my introduction into the souls universe and it was truly an amazing experience.People always say Dark souls is difficult, Dark Souls is hard. But it really isn't. It's challenging. It requires your attention. Masterful architecture, stunning graphics, wonderful level design, full of shorcuts and the fights. The tactical side behind each fight leaves so spoiled that every other game fighting mechanic seems rather simplistic and boring in comparison.Bosses are fantastic for the most part. Every bosses were unique and well designed. TBH the bosses are so good that you feel honored to be killed by them. Each boss has a personality and backstory that makes fighting them either extremely exciting or super sad. One of the most beautiful things about Dark Souls III is the music. The music is simply stunning!10/10 for me",1

Positive,I played this after finishing Elden Ring and if you loved Elden Ring then it's very likely that you'll love Dark Souls 3 too. The cycle of death and perseverance makes the eventual successes you achieve all the more sweeter.,1
Positive,"Seriously, one of the best games i've ever played in my life.I've never been a fan of RPGs myself, always went for FPS games. But i got an interest for this game, for it was known for it's ""diffculty"" (more onto that later), the bosses, the sceneries, etc.I was gifted this game, and i have to say, it was one of the best gifts i've ever received.About the game itself, if you are scared to pick it up, don't. The game is not as hard as people make it out to be, it just leaves you to discover stuff for yourself, to learn the mechanics, playstyles, etc.This game is by far the best for beginners to the DARK SOULS franchise, for it has the most polished gameplay out of the three, with some more simpler mechanics.kinda of. Parries are definetely something that actually requires a bit of skill, and the same goes for backstabs, to a certain extent. You have to be more precise with stab than in previous games, but we're getting offtrack. The story is good, nothing really amazing, but the main focus of the story is good. The lore of the rest of the kingdom of Lothric (and the DLC worlds too) are what's interesting about DARK SOULS games. The lore of every boss, every area, every enemy, it's all really fascinating and well crafted, just like in other games, so it doesn't disappoint in that regard.Gameplay in itself i found pretty satisfying, but i do think the PVP part of the game could have some problems fixed (Hackers, Griefers, etc)Soundtrack in the game is also pretty awesome. There is something in particular about the Final Boss' theme that has made a lot of people really emotional (myself included). It's a really cool easter egg, but i won't spoil anything. This game's music is something you have to experience yourself to understand how awesome and well produced it is.The game in itself is beautiful. It has stunning graphics and is extremely well optimized (except for the beggining of the Ringed City DLC, all the ash may eat up your frames). All the effects, boss fights, sceneries and enemies have an immense amount of care put into them, to make them feel like they belong in this fantasy world, and to look the best they possibly can. In short, DARK SOULS 3 is an amazing game, not too far from a masterpiece in my opinion. Shame that it still has some things that should've been improved by this time, but whatever, the game is still playable. I highly recommend giving this game a try. Seriously, it's amazing.",1
Positive,good game ahead,1
Positive,"A lovely game only The Great Miyazaki could create. The aspects of Dark Souls, the series as a whole, are irrefutably unique and addictive. DS3 did a great job bringing back to the rolling i-frames of DS1 with much smoother game play, it felt completely natural. 9/10.",1

Positive,I would recommend it,1
Positive,"I highly recommend this game, but understand that it isn't for everyone. Once you pass the learning curve it becomes a very enjoyable experience because of the feeling you get from overcoming a challenge.Ignore all the stupid kids yelling ""git gud"" whenever you ask for help. While ""getting good"" is definitely the primary way to pass a hard area, the game is amazingly designed so that you can always overcome the challenge somehow; whether it's by grinding, trying something else, leveling up, or asking a white phantom (a friend) for help.Don't be scarred away by the difficultly, just rise to the challenge.",1

I was so addicted to beating the bosses. I didn't care about deaths anymore, I just wanted to beat the game! What a great experience 10/10!",1
Positive,"-The gameplay is amazingly fluid and precise.-There is verry little input lag, even if you play with mouse and keyboard.-You are able to roll diagonally towards or away from your enemies when the camera is locked onto them, instead of only letting you roll straight towards or away from them.-As to be expected by a Souls game, you have to keep an eye on your stamina bar. You cannot just reclessly keep hitting or rolling, forcing you to think wether or not you play more risky or rather safe.-Items have not only resistance/attack atributes, but also weight, so, like in other Souls games, having heavier armor may reduce the damage you take by enemy hits, but also slows your moving speed and your rolls down. The player must choose carefully what armor/weapons/rings they wear.-The soundtrack is atmospheric and the sound design in general is pleasing.-Although some soundtracks are less powerfull, they still all fit the setting and are verry high quality music with many nunances and details.-Like the other two Dark Souls games the music isnt present everywhere, giving you silence to hear the quiete background sounds of the levels and to think about where you are on your journey and what is happening. Simultaniously, because the music isnt there for the most time of playing, it makes the music all the more powerfull and impressing when it does kick in, while entering a place of great signinficance or a boss arena.-It is capped at 60 fps, but it should run on most pcs always at that framerate and it is good enough for a 3rd person role play game, wich doesnt have fast camera movements for the most part.-I havent encountered many bugs. Rarelly the game crashes, maybe a couple times a year. There are some glitches here and there, but i havent seen gamebreaking bugs so far.-The graphics might not be the best looking out there, but they are cohesive and form a nice looking world.-Shadows and lighting effects look nice and most surfaces and especially character models have sharp and detailed textures.-There are quite many settings to adjust, but antialising doesnt have high settings, so there is always some amount of jagged edges if you pay close attention.-The level design is verry well made. Many people dislike it because not all levels are completelly interconnected in a tight area like they are in Dark Souls, but it offers a wide variety of locations, in a continous world with next to none loading screens. Also you can see many parts of the world in the distance, meaning you can walk through an entire area, look back and see the places you have been, or you can look forwards beyond the edges of your current area and see parts of the places where you will later go. You may not have the same freedom as you do have in Dark Souls to go in one of many different directions from the beginning, but you still can choose to some degree in wich order to play through the areas and you can even choose to go early in late game areas. if you are a masochist or a professional speed runner, much like in Dark Souls.-Each location offers not only different types of enemies, but also different types of environmental hazards and its own setting with its own kind of beauty.-There is a plethora of different items to discover. Sure there are some items that are ""useless"" and many items you wont need for your playstyle, but there is freedom of leveling up your character and choosing the equipment that best suits your own way of playing the game. Generally speaking there is some usage for almost all of the items in the game.-Each fight is challenging and requires the player to think and make propper use of their weapons and equipment.-Combat is methodical. Every type of enemy has their own moveset and the player must understand each type of enemy and adapt their playstyle to them or use the right weapons and armor.-Running in a fight head first and attacking without thinking may have you soon surrounded by enemies and result in a fast death.-Bossfights. What would a Souls/Borne/Sekiro game be without bossfights?! The bosses here are, as expected, quite hard when you face them the first time. Some may be easy in general, but every single boss is unique, with his own skillset, moveset, strengths and weaknesses. No matter what path you choose for your character and how you play the game, there are challenges for every player type. Fights you find to be easy may be torment for others and fights wich other palyers find easy you may struggle to get through.-There is no ""perfect build"" or ""easy mode"". You must understand what you are doing wrong and correct it, or maybe even change your gear if you find your weapon, for example, being too slow or too weak for a boss you are struggling with.-The player decides on their own how they build their character. You are free to choose when you level up and how you spend your level points in the different stats of your character.-When you die you loose your ember status. To restore it (wich increases your max health by 30% and enables the ability to summon other players to your world and also to be invaded by other players, if you play online) you have to either beat the next boss or consume an ember.-Also when you die, like in the other Dark Souls games, you drop your souls and it gives you one chance to go back to the spot where you died and retrieve your souls (the currency you receive from defeated enemies, wich you can spend to level up, buy items or upgrade your weapons). If you die again before you retrieve your dropped souls you loose them.-Stroger enemies give more souls, so while you progress thorugh the game you have a higher income so to speak but also each level up increases the cost of the next level up a little bit. Also you can find souls as items and you can sell the items you find for souls.-Dispite what the internet wants you to believe, Dark Souls 3, like all Souls/Borne/Sekiro games, isnt that hard. The difference compared to other games is simply that you dont get everything shoved in your face. You have to learn through failure. The game demands from you to overcome your enemies and ""git gud"". It will never just hand a victory over to you, but the more you will enjoy every single victory, as you actually achieved it either through skill and timing or through clever use of your equipment and patience.-Dark Souls 3 has plenty of help built into it, but you decide wether or not you open the help menu and read what the stats of your character and equipment do, you decide if you stop and read the developer messages or not, you decide if you open the item descriptions and read what each item does.-The hard thing here is to learn from your mistakes, to bring the willpower to endure failure and grow to be able to succeed. You have to turn on your brain and understand the strengths and weaknesses both of your enemies and your self.Overall Dark Souls 3 delivers a verry enjoyable experience.It offers a decent challenge for new and experienced players alike, while never being really unfair.The world is immersive, the lore goes as deep as Souls lore goes and the presentation is impressive.Gameplay is verry good and the atmosphere is amazing.If you are up for a new challenge or if you are already familiar with Dark Souls and seek more of that experience i can highly recommend this game to you.On the other hand if you are verry impatient and dont like to invest time into completing a game then this is clearly not the right game for you.",1

Positive,"Dark Souls III is everything you wanted from the first Dark Souls, and leaves out what made you dislike Dark Souls II. While I will continue playing this game even after completing it; I wanted to give you guys a proper review.Environment is breath taking, and puts the earlier Dark Souls games to shame in comparison.Far more interesting enemies than humans in armor, including bosses.Nostalgia is strong with this game, and you'll love every reference thrown your way.AI improved dramatically, so enemies are going to give you a challenge.Weapon variety is great, which also applies to armor.Armor cannot be upgraded, so wear whatever you want. Fashion souls is back!If you love exploring, this game will consume you. Easy to get lost in.So many shortcuts, secrets, illusionary walls, you'll always stumble on something new.Co-op is easy to access, and hardly any problems with the server.Character creation offers a ton of options for making your character stand out.Each weapon has a special ability, making each one unique on it's own.NPCs are really developed, and don't stay in one spot. They're also very likable too.Quests are back, so you can go back to certain areas and activate new events.If you like horror films, this game has some nightmare fuel for yah.Can now get your flask out during a fight without searching through slots (hold down on down depad).Replayability is a solid option for sure. You'll most likely have multiple playthroughs.Enemies don't despawn, so you can grind to your heart's content.Your covenant changes the kind of invader you are (sunlight makes you a golden red phantom).Soul Memory is gone, so get as many souls as you want for upgrades / items.Four endings to earn, each offering a strong impact to the story.Heavily influenced by Bloodborne's mechanics, so most enemies are fast & furious.Enemies don't really have a stamina limit, so they can spam their combos for awhile.Lack of spells, hexes, miracles, and pyromancies. They're all cool, but not many to be found.PvP is sluggish, inferior to Dark Soul 2's PvP which was fun and balanced.Certain enemies can't be beaten unless you have certain items or do certain tasks.Game can feel short if you don't take the time to explore any optional areas.Until you reach more than half way into the game, weapons are hard to upgrade.Too many ambushes, which leaves you less surprised when it happens again.Most enemies have higher poise than you, so you're going to be dodging / blocking more often.Game is more demanding with graphics than Dark Souls 2, so you might need to turn certain options on low.Certain areas make the FPS drop, or lag so be ready for that.Tends to crash now and again, depending on what you're doing.Covenants are weak, and not satisfying to rank up in.Invasions / invading isn't fun because again PvP is sluggish, wonky and poorly done.NPCs can die easily from anything, so an enemy can kill them during mid conversation.Ember is hard to find, but luckily helping hosts gives you one per successful mission.NPC enemies / invaders deal more damage, have more HP & poise than you. Unfair.Can lose the chance on getting items / armor if particular quests failed.Greatswords and weapons alike are either weak or OP, there is no middle ground.Game rewards you for being aggressive & spamming over thinking carefully like previous games.Luck is useless due to the fact you can grind enemies without them despawning.Is Dark Souls III worth getting? YES. It's an excellent game and despite there's a lot of issues I have here and there with it, they did an excellent job making this game spectacular. NPCs are engaging & very interesting, bosses along with nearly every enemy possess unique designs, almost all the weapons are handy in doing something useful, co-op is very enjoyable to be a part of, scenery & the setting is absolutely beautiful (even in the areas meant to look ugly are appealing to the eye), and each build is going to be fun to experiment with. Granted, it's a shame that the game wants you to play it like you're in Bloodborne instead and most of the enemies are way to hostile & fast for their own good, but otherwise this game is a solid 8.5 out of 10 for me. Worth full price, plus we haven't even gotten the DLC yet! Hope you guys were able to get most out of my review, and please feel free to ask me any questions about the game!",1

Is placed with purpose to provide the story and build the tragic world you are experiencing.",1
Positive,"Dark Souls 3 is the final Soulslike game I played, having played before every other one made by FromSoftware. Visiting the same old places from Dark Souls 1, and meeting the same characters or their descendants, seeing those signs and landmarks was so special to me.I love games where there's continuity, and coming to DS3 as the final game in FS's Soulslikes catalog, and seeing familiar faces and places was the icing on the cake to me, it made the whole journey so exceptional and so real.Every time I entered a new area, to me that was my favorite area, and no bonfire was lit without a memory, or a nod back to the past and to DS1 being felt, seen, heard, or invoked in my head. This alone made the game incredibly special. How it tries to tie everything together and put an end to it all. Albeit what is an end really is up for debate, if there's such a thing whatsoever.The amount of weapons, spells, shields, and armor sets is staggering. They went all in, no matter what kind of stick you like to wield, it's here. Some of the most memorable boss fights are here, seeing good old, and grey, Anor Londo again was worth the world to me. The Firelink Shrine being displayed on my screen sent a shiver down my spine. All of Gwen and Gwynevere's statues, Onion bro, Andre, and Havel.I think whatever can be said about the gameplay or the game itself has been said before throughout the years so I would like to talk about something that was never said before, about how this game made me feel.Pathos, what the Greeks used to describe as emotions. Something that already resides in us (Dark Souls 1 (and 2) and their events) and was invoked at every turn, the linking of the fire, our duty, our sense of purpose which we remember and hold ever so close to our hearts so we don't go hollow, the state of the world, and its inhabitants, and the eternal unanswerable question, why are we here? The whole thing went before my eyes, and I find it hard to talk about now, there's just so much, I feel so much yet I can't pour it into words and I think that is exactly why I love those games so deeply. It's that elusive invisible thing that you feel as you concur the game, as you bear the duty, O branded one, of linking the fire and renewing the world for again that is your duty. And perhaps, that's simply why you are here.To me, it wasn't about gaining power, ascending, or traveling through the cosmos, all of those are themes we have seen before in their games, to me it was about doing what I was meant to do, for this fight is a fight for the flame, for my fellow kin and one where I wasn't about to squander.Prithee, Hollow, is this not what we were rallied for and to the Asylum up north sent to achieve?Prithee, Hollow, is this not why we jumped into the raging sea in Things Betwixt?And, Prithee again, Hollow, is this not why we wake up and head to our home, the Firelink Shrine, where it all first began just to end again?From a Nameless, accursed Undead, unfit even to be cinders. to a true Lord, fit to link the Fire.This is what it is about to me. It does not matter where we came from, or what we are, what matters is what we do with the little knowledge we have, in the face of the dying, crumbling, and lonely reality we are in.Similarly, IMO, it is as is our journey in real life, we know not where we came from if we had existed before, nor do we know where we are headed exactly after, if to any place. But in my opinion, what matters is the journey and, ironically, as you build your character in Dark Souls in the game, you are meant to build your human self character in real life. One and the same, and all driven by one's choices, in a world where we presumably had no choice about anything whatsoever.Our weaknesses and hollowness could never stop us from rising again and marching on towards achieving our duty, zealous as ever and brave as ever.Once a choosing undead, is now a Lord of Cinder.",1

Positive,"I rate this game: 9.5/10!1st off; This game is my introduction to the series. Dark Souls III is a game that wasn't on my radar, wasn't planning to play, didn't think I would enjoy. It is a game that viewers on my Twitch Channel (The Chronicles of Euther[www.twitch.tv]) challenged me to play. In short, Viewers were betting subscriptions -vs- me not dying more then 1000 times. I took that bet and streamed the entire game on Twitch. I died approx 700 time before 100% the base game. This game cost me two- (2) controllers. The right trigger snapped two- (2) times. It was truly an experience worth struggling (and I mean struggling) through and I invested 374 hrs in this game to date. Regarding the story line and Lore, you will have to due some reading on the internet. There are side stories, too, and you really need to pay attention to what the NPCs say, or you will miss something. No doubt.Dark Souls III is an action role-playing video game developed by FromSoftware and published by Bandai Namco Entertainment for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Microsoft Windows. An entry in the Souls series, Dark Souls III was released in Japan in March 2016 and worldwide in April 2016.It was/is critically and commercially successful, with critics calling it a worthy and fitting conclusion to the series. It was the fastest-selling game in Bandai Namco's history, shipping over three million copies worldwide within the first two months after release. A complete version containing the base game and both downloadable content expansions, titled Dark Souls III: The Fire Fades, was released in April 2017.This game will test your patience, fortitude and emotional state. I can not count the amount of times I RAGED playing this game.The game is played in a third-person perspective. Players are equipped with a variety of weapons to fight against enemies, such as special weapons, bows, throwable projectiles, and swords. Even shields can act as secondary weapons but they are mainly used to deflect enemies' attacks and protect the player from suffering damage. In addition, attacks can be evaded through dodge-rolling. YOU WILL DO THIS ALOT! I'm not kidding. Bonfires, serve as inventory, Save and Travel checkpoints. ""Ashes"", play an important role in the game (you will have to find this out yourself. Magic is also featured in the game, known as ""focus points"" (FP). When performing spells, the player's focus points are consumed. There are two separate types of Estus Flasks in the game, which can be allotted to fit a players' particular play style. One of them refills hit points, while another, newly introduced in Dark Souls III, refills focus points.Combat and movements are fast and fluid. The mechanic are will done. Several player movements (such as backstepping and swinging heavy weapons) can be performed pretty rapidly, allowing players to deal more damage in a short period of time.Throughout the game, players encounter different types of enemies, each with different behaviors. Some of them change their combat pattern during battles. You will need to spend time LEARNING (through trial and error) about each enemy to defeat them. The game places more focus on role-playing; the expanded character builder and improved weapons provide the player with more tactical options. Finally, the game does features multiplayer elements like the previous games in the series. I was really surprised how much fun I had playing with other players too. It was a blast.Finally, the visuals in this game are phenomenal! I kid you not. If that is your ""thing"", you are going to be amazed. Here is the link to my Screenshot Wall.

Positive,"This is a great Souls game, and in my opinion, a great game overall. I really enjoy the combat, audio, and if you are able to stomach the fact that the mouse and keyboard controls aren't great, it plays well with a controller.The world design is pretty good, but seems a bit linear. There are connections and shortcuts throughout the game, but the path is still one and you gotta follow it to progress through the game. The ability to teleport from each bonfire is also a proof of the linearity, since it would take ages to move from an area to the other, just by running. The story is told in a great way, for those who take their time to analyze and actually ""study"" the game environment. Storytelling is done throughout the game by environments, enemy placements, items description, drops, so on and so forth. Basically every element of this game is telling a story. This game is great. Would recommend it? Definitely.",1

Positive,"DS III is a best of souls series for me. There are a good memories about it. I just wish they had more time to complete the game as they saw it - with more bonfire mechanics and many more content. I think DS III is great game, but if final release of the game would kept world as it intended to be, it would be a perfect game for me. Still waiting for possible (?) complete edition with all cut content.",1
Positive,"DS3 delivers a great Dark Souls RPG experience more akin to the first Dark Souls than DS2. Fun boss encounters with a variety of builds possible. Would recommend installing the Cinders Mod to fix ""issues"" with base game like poise/making all builds/weapons viable. Be way of online play as you might encounter hackers & interacting with them may get you ""banned"" from the online matchmaking.Dark fantasy action combat (Souls-like) RPG If you're familiar with previous Dark Souls games, the gameplay for the most part is the same. You begin by creating a character and picking a starting class (e.g. Knight, Pyromancer, Sorcerer) with predefined stats and equipment. You progress from area to area killing monsters and absorbing souls from fallen enemies. At the world hub, you can spend your souls to upgrade your stats to make the build you see fit. Bonfires are scattered around and are basically zone checkpoints that you return to once you die, or you can teleport from one bonfire to any other bonfire in the world. You progress through the game by clearing zones and killing the zones' bosses, namely a specific set of bosses need to die before the game's final boss becomes available but you'll eventually encounter every other boss along the way. In terms of what is new in DS3 that isn't found in DS1 or DS2, DS3 introduces weapon arts to the game which are pretty much a secondary attack style/animation (besides from the L1/L2 attack) inherent in pretty much every weapon in the game. Weapon arts expunge the FP (blue) meter to use and therefore have a finite amount of uses like spells. The art style of DS3, like previous Dark Souls titles, is deliberately very bleak and oppressing. The world lacks much color and gives you an apocalyptic feeling as everything in the world is soulless and wants to kill you. The environments and game effects are nicely textured, the weapons and armor and unique and interesting, animations are great and give you a clear sign of what an enemy is attempting to do, and overall everything came together nicely. Some areas can get quite dark so bring a torch/light spell if you can't see so you don't get surprised by a mob lurking in the shadows. You play the role as the Ashen One, an undead who rises from the grave to fulfill the purpose of returning the souls of the Lords of Cinder to their thrones in order to end the curse of the undead and end the cycle of the First Flame. There's a lot more going on that you have do discover yourself by reading item descriptions and listening to NPC conversations. DS3 has a lot of lore to be discovered and if you are highly interested, there are many videos out there that explain it in much detail. DS3 feels like a return to form as most movement and combat animations are similar to the original Dark Souls. If you played DS2 and everything in that game felt/looked awkward, you'll be happy to know that's been rectified here. The game can be a great challenge for newbies and veterans alike. You are constantly kept on your toes on the lookout for possible enemy ambushes as there are plenty of deliberate item and enemy placements throughout the game. Hundreds of weapons, armor pieces, and rings to equip and create a build from. The introduction of weapon arts makes weapon choice a lot more interesting as you can choose a weapon based on its attack style/specific weapon art properties. Boss encounters are unique and fun. Only a few are gimmicked to be defeated a certain way, but otherwise you can defeat them how you want: solo, with help, with swords, with magic, etc. PvP exists in the form of covenant-based/red-orb invasions where players intrude into other online players' instances and attempt to defeat them by however they choose to. There are also unofficial but more honorable PvP locations where players duel each other and usually abide by a set of honorable rules (e.g. no healing allowed). Technically, PvP is an opt-in feature as you can disable all PvP by playing in offline-mode, but that would also disable co-op viability. The Cinders mod is touted as the ""definitive way"" to experience DS3 as it brings into the game armors and weapons from previous Dark Souls games, fixes & enhances the poise system in the base game, mixes up enemy placements in the world/adds new enemies into previous zones, creates alternate routing by connecting previously unconnected zones, and adds in toggleable difficulty settings in Firelink Shrine to make the game even harder for the veterans out there. Did my most recently playthrough of DS3 as an all-around caster using Cinders and it was great fun. Gets my recommendation for sure. Online play is a hit or miss. You can run into legit players doing some honest (or not so-honest but at least not cheating) PvP, or you might encounter someone who just one shots you (because cheats). This is a double-edged sword as interacting with hackers might get you on a banlist that matchmakes you only with other people that are also on the banlist. It's a slippery slope that I cannot provide much insight on as I haven't played online since 2016. When I last tried building a caster in 2016, I recall that it felt very underpowered/underwhelming. I don't know if casting has since been buffed, but playing as a caster felt comfortable and natural with the Cinders mod so you might want to use the mod if you decide to create a build in such a fashion.8.5/10A good return to the feeling of DS1 and a good departure from the dread of DS2. Solid RPG combat, a deep & engrossing world if you choose to look into it, and an overall fun time killing everything before it kills you. Checkbox reviews are lazy copy & paste bullsh*t. ASCII art reviews tell you nothing. ""Let's be honest, I only wrote this review for awards"" is a waste of everyone's time.

Positive,"Dark Souls 3 is the souls game that we wanted, and it is the souls game we got. As the smoothest and most refined of the trio, DS3 takes what was good in DS1 and DS2. and expands on it (aside from no power-stancing).To start, the gameplay is extremely smooth, and combat works exactly how you desire it. One of the biggest issues I had with DS2 was that combat felt clunky. That issue does not exist with DS3. Due to DS3 being a lot more modern than DS1, the combat also just feels more fleshed out. You still have your melee, ranged, magic builds, but DS3 introduces a mana bar. I still think the game was meant to be played melee, but whatever build you do is up to you.Bosses were extremely memorable and scale up pretty reasonably. The bosses in the early game are manageable even if you are new to souls, especially since quite a few of them are gimmick bosses. However, we get some of the most memorable bosses across the souls games in DS3. Whereas in DS1 we had many extremely memorable bosses, DS3 introduces a large plethora as well (DS2 bosses were overall less memorable IMO). Some of the ones I thought were most memorable include: Nameless King, Lord of Cinders, Sister Friede (DLC), Gael (DLC), Lothric Princes, Aldritch, and Champion Gundyr. What's better is that DS3 is actually quite related to DS1, and you'll even revisit Anor Londo!Map design is also excellent for DS3, and you get some of the same stuff that we loved about souls in DS3. Most of the main world is connected in some way as a big map, with twists and turns bringing you to new regions that somehow link up again afterwards. Shortcuts, hidden paths, bonfires, etc. make the map and levels really fun to get through. One of the best feelings is when you'd been grinding for a while and then suddenly open up a shortcut via an elevator or something.The only part of the game that I highly disliked is the 100% achievement hunt. DS3 is basically souls achievement grinding on steroids, because getting all the rings takes so much time. Additionally, in order to get all the different spells, you need to max out covenants. To max out covenants, you need certain drops that were meant to be received via PvP. Now if I played DS3 when it came out, this should have been no issue because there were plenty of people playing online. However, years later now the online base has dwindled, making farming covenant items much harder. If you were to farm it PvE, it has an extremely rare chance to drop in certain mobs. making the PvE grind experience super super annoying, boring, and uninspiring. I ended up sticking it out for 100% to the end, but it was not worth it.Overall, definitely one of the most fun Souls games. I highly recommend you pick the game up and give it a swing. You will not be dissappointed.",1

Positive,Very fun game some parts frustrating others just really fun and complex. The scenery in this game is cool all the way around. I myself find this game a great way to make new friends may it be invaders or summons. Really fun game. Long May The Sun Shine - Siegward of Catarina :praisesun:,1
Positive,Its an ok game I guess,1
Positive,"In the short time that I've been playing this game I've already been blown away with the return of a true Souls experience. The Combat is quick and responsive and the enemies feel much more intelligent. The first thing I noticed with DS3 over the others is how incredibly smooth it is. Dodging has never been so fun! They've added a few things to make the initial start a little less aggravating, without over-doing it and making it too easy.",1
Positive,"It's Dark Souls 3 so if you're a fan of the series then you'll know exactly what to expect - - Awesomely responsive and intuitive combat.- You'll die a lot.- An immensely detailed and dark fantasy setting.- Loads of cool weapons and gear to dress your dude or lady up in.- You'll pick up items with vague and cryptic descriptions and think ""What the fuck is this and what the fuck does it do?""- You'll die a lot.- It's HARD but fair and nowhere near as difficult as people who don't play the series think it is.- You'll die and shout at your screen something like ""Bullshit!"" and then come back and try again about 25 times.- There will be huge, scary bosses to fight and you'll think to yourself ""I'll never beat this"" and then on the 10th try you'll beat it (Summon someone to help, no one will judge you) and scream at your monitor.- You'll reach that point in every Souls game where you have to bite the bullet and do some grinding to get STRONGER!- You'll probably spend more time exploring wiki's than playing the actual game.So Yeah, it's the Dark Souls we all love and it's pretty great.",1
Positive,Amazing chest ahead!,1
Positive,"The game of Dark Souls 3 is a very fun and rewarding experience for those who really want to try it. I have had a great time playing this game, I just wish they would have done better with their anti-cheat system in the beginning. I would recommend this game in its current state to anyone I know or anyone I do not know. The pvp is frustrating, the bugs are frustrating, the game itself is very frustrating. But it is a lot of fun.",1
Positive,I never knew Dark Souls would be this fun,1
Positive,"I've played all of the Souls games, including Demon's (although never finished it to the very end). Ever since I first played Dark Souls years ago, I fell in love with the franchise. It was the first Souls experience to me. That game showed me that games can still be very challenging, with amazingly well made fantasy worlds including all sorts of nightmarish creatures. Dark Souls 3 continues the epicness the earlier ones had. I love this game, even if some moments felt impossible or quite frustrating lol. It has much of the same old gameplay mechanics from previous games, but with new additions too and the combat is mostly fast-paced.I feel like it's a great mix of Dark Souls and Bloodborne, without the dash-dodge of BB. The world itself in Dark Souls 3 is amazing in my opinion, not as well made as the perfect design in Dark Souls with those upper and lower journeys, which is the best in the series. But it's still really cool and you can basically go visit every place you see in the distance eventually. That's one thing I love about these games, to feel like you actually are in this huge unkown mysterious world. As previous games, DS3 doesn't hold your hand. You have to figure out where to go, how to fight enemies and bosses, learn their weakness and patterns to win and death will teach you again.There were few areas or enemies which I didn't like so much because of reasons, but that is a part of these games. I do love how DS3 pays tribute to DS1 in few ways, but I won't go into more detail about that.The soundtrack is soooo fantastic and introduces many cool songs, which fit well in the intense boss fights to make them even greater :D.New monster design is mostly amazing, as I said it reminds me of Bloodborne with certain opponents. Also some of the monsters feels like, as if they were taken inspiration from Berserk manga again as the creator is a fan of it, which is of course really great. I have to say that the boss design and fights are some of the best I have ever encountered, there are many memorable ones and at least 3 were really tough to me. One of the bosses felt a bit disappointing because of the way to defeat it, but was still so cool. I think I did every boss fight as solo, except one. And when you do it alone, the feeling and adrenaline rush is so much greater. The last boss of DS3 could very well be the hardest fight I've ever fought in games and I loved that, even harder than Artorias of DS1. Part of it could be because having a different build than in previous games so it honestly felt impossible, I dunno. But oh boy.it was just insane and such a thrilling fight. Lots of suffering, but eventually when you survive alone these kind of encounters, that feeling of victory is so good. I don't think many other games give that satisfaction and this is one big reason I love the Souls games. Fighting alone in the dark places, against a gigantic or just ultra aggressive bosses is simply one incredible feeling.The multiplayer is similar to DS1. When you summon friends for co-op, they can help you on the road a long time or help kill a boss which is nice. Not badly done like in DS2 where you disappear after killing a couple enemies. I've read many being disappointed with the game, like having connection issues or getting banned for no reasons. Which sucks. But I personally barely had any issues as my Chloe in my 60h+ journey, there was perhaps only 5-6 times when I couldn't enter boss fog door to help a fellow player after he summoned me. Because of connection lag, but that's it.Well it seems I ended up writing more than I first planned :). I say Dark Souls 3 is definitely a worthy send-off to the franchise, as it is informed to be the last one. An epic dark journey and amongst my most favorite experiences ever. I recommend this to those who want to experience challenging and really cool gaming moments. For fans of Souls it's a must.10/10",1

I just kept at it, inspired by the Idle Thumbs playthrough, and now I'm almost 60 hours into this character and I love it. It may be one of my favorite games of all time. Sometimes it's infuriating, but oh man, when you finally power through whatever boss or obstacle is holding you back, it's an amazing feeling.

A good storyline accompanied with extremely beautiful cutscenes will not let you fall into boredom. Just try any game from Dark Souls series: these games are absolutely funny and they are suitable for relaxation after a hard day.In total: 10/10",1
Positive,"Now, with my vast experience of every SoulsBorne game, and each of those from the Dark Souls trilogy on at least two platforms, I believe I can offer a well educated judgement of Dark Souls 3. I will be comparing it to its predecessors, naturally, but I shall also judge Dark Souls 3 as a game in its own right.So, for those that haven't played a Souls game before, and won't understand my comparisons. Dark Souls 3 is an amazing game, but don't buy it. Go play the others, at least Dark Souls 1, or I'll come to your house and slap you until you do.Right. For those experienced in souls, and want to know what Dark Souls 3 is like. Prepare to be both amazed and disappointed by this game. Dark Souls 3 keeps the complex combat of the previous games, in face goes one step further by making it so complex that it makes no f***ing sense. Diminishing returns and the peculiar new 'poise' mechanic make ultra-heavy armours mostly useless, as they weigh you down. It's fine for me, because I always had 0 poise, but for those that always killed the 4 Kings by R1 spamming in Havel's. gone are those days - but chugging is easier. As usual, there's a hell of a lot of weapon variety. Unfortunately, only a few from each class are viable, as many weapons are wholly outclassed by others in their category. The same goes for armour, but nobody cares because fashion is what's important. Despite what some say, magic IS viable in DS3 and actually remains the most powerful thing in the game if used correctly. Hyper Armour is a new addition. Certain weapon types now offer hyper armour during parts of their animations. This is good, since there is a lack of useful poise, but is very easily abused. and so 2-handed Hollowslayer is very powerful against someone who can't parry - not kidding, among the best weapons in the game.The world design is similar-ish to DS2 mixed with Demon's Souls, but the individual area design is more akin to Dark Souls 1. In general, it's bloomin' good, I just wish the world as a whole was more connected. The HUB of the game works a lot like ademon's Souls and Bloodborne. Host to your very own Maiden / Doll for levelling, merchants, a blacksmith, and gathering place for various NPCs. it feels a lot like the Nexus in this regard. It is also disconnected from the main world.The story and lore is just as expansive as its predecessors, and only more theories and secrets are coming to light as time passes. The same goes for a NPC quest lines. They are very akin to those in DS1, boasting unique encounters with NPCs and witnessing their stories unfold as yours does - take Ostrava, Siegmeyer, Solaire and Logan's quests for example. Most quests are as complex in nature, each with their own emotional and compelling story, as well as new kinds of gameplay features to improve upon the quests. Honestly, I think DS3 is host to some of the best NPC quests and characters, on par with Bloodborne and Dark Souls 1. Unfortunately, we have no Mephistopheles asking us to kill everyone, but there is one similar quest, and obvious reference.The soundtrack is amazing, on par with that of predecessors, and accompanied by equally awesome bosses. There are slight disappointments, as with all of the games, but the majority are very good. Just be warned, bosses are more aggressive in DS3.Finally, I'll summarise. Dark Souls 3 has its fair share of disappointments, but the are few enough not to tarnish the beauty of the game, and they are almost all mechanic based disappointments that may or may not be altered in later patches. The game, as a whole however, is fantastic and absolutely worth buying. PvP takes getting used to, because of the changes, it is still good. And some covenants suck, but that's nothing new. However, don't let it deter you from getting yet another FromSoft masterpiece.PS - Also. do buy that PS4 for Bloodborne, because it IS worth it.",1
Positive,"Dark Souls 3 (2016), with its thrilling gameplay and immersive world, stands as a testament to the brilliance of FromSoftware's game design.

Positive,"Dark Souls 3 is the third entry in the brutally challenging dark fantasy series created by From Software. It is a third person action roleplaying game with a focus on intense fast paced combat. The game offers many hours of content and fun amazing boss battles which really are the highlight of this game, finally beating a boss after the 20th or so time gives you a level of satisfaction unrivalled by most games out there. On top of that is some truly amazing level design and a gorgeous soundtrack. The graphics are good for its age and some locations in the game look stunning thanks to great art direction. It will also offer you a generous amount of replayability and you will discover new things even after several times beating it. Phenomenal boss battles unrivaled by other games Third person melee combat Soundtrack Level design that requires you to think Zero handholding Very fun with a group of friends Cool magic Brutally challenging difficulty Multiplayer is laggy sometimes Unsatisfactory PC port Lack of proper mouse and keyboard controls Online co-op is needlessly confusing Questionable placement of two certain bonfiresThis has to be one of the hardest and most challenging games I ve ever played. The gameplay consists of walking around decrepit environments riddled with tough enemies, secret pathways and hidden items. The level design is truly amazing, feels quite interconnected with many shortcuts and you actually have to use your brain, except for one instance where there are two bonfires right next to each other for no reason. That combat in this game is amazing with a huge amount of enemy and weapon variety and it is very fast paced with a large variety of playstyles. Are you someone who plays as a tank with a massive sword or a wizard who shoots spells? You can play as both leading to lots of replayability and messing around with weapons to find the one you like. The best part about this game is the boss battles which are so good you will find all non-Soulsbornekiro game s boss fights lacking in comparison to this game. There is also online co-op and PvP to play with friends however figuring out how the co-op works is very confusing until you get used to it. I ve rarely bothered with PvP but it s usually laggy and frustrating. The graphics are good for their age of the game and some areas look outstanding. It is also a very good game to see in motion thanks to the fluid enemy animations in combat. However, every single one of the default characters in the character creator screen look like they re constipated and have brain damage, NPC s mouths don t even move when they speak except for one and the game always looks like it has a light grey tinge to everything. The sound design is good but reused sounds from previous Dark Souls games. The voice acting is consistently good and there s not a single bad performance. The soundtrack is incredible and sounds great, you will be listening to the soundtrack on Youtube long after you re finished with the game and gotten bored. Unfortunately the PC port of this game is rather meh, no 21:9 support and It s locked at 60fps. As someone who uses an ultrawide 100hz monitor, I am rather disappointed and it is my main flaw with this game. However the gameplay is good enough for this to only seem as a minor issue in the overall experience. Also, when you use a keyboard and mouse there are only Xbox controller inputs for the UI making it almost impossible to play for people who don t own a controller. I m not a fan of RPGs, but this is an exception; it s made me want to play and finish the other two Dark Souls games, Bloodborne and Sekiro as it s just that good. Everyone should give this game a try even if they think they re not going to enjoy it.Follow our curator page: OCG-Curations if you like and want to see more reviews like this one.",1
Positive,"Finished Dark Souls 3 after an intense 11 days. With a Soul Level of 116. Spoilers from here on.In short, it's a great Souls game. It feels very focused in most aspects. Changing covenants is easier, armor upgrades are gone, stats are trimmed down, the world feels tighter, grinding for upgrade materials wasn't necessary. I also liked the slightly improved weapon infusing system. There is now a more clear way to infuse weapons with each ""elemental"" and still have stat scaling while there are ""simpler"" infusions available of each kind for better base damage output but no scaling at all. Sounds complicated when reading but it's the easiest upgrade system so far. Another mechanical change is that the camera and player movement feel more similar to Dark Souls 1 which I prefer over the feel of Dark Souls 2. I enjoyed the pacing and focused design. Reminds me of Demon's Souls.This more focused design also shows itself in the world and bosses. There are fewer bosses and the game generally felt lighter and shorter, seeing DS2. It by no means lacks content though. Especially compared to Dark Souls 2, the world feels more believable and cohesive. The areas themselves are also better designed and most importantly to me, offer much better boss encounters than its predecessor. This makes me most happy as the bosses in DS2 were for the most part lackluster. I thoroughly enjoyed almost each and every boss for their unique designs, unique behaviors and unique flow of battle. Interestingly enough I had the by far easiest time so far in any Souls game with DS3. Not sure if it stems from the experience in the series but on the other hand I've heard of friends with tales of horror about certain bosses which I managed to down on my first or second try. In terms of music Demon's Souls and Dark Souls offer more haunting and memorable tracks but there were several nice ones here that caught my attention. Abyss Watcher and Prince Lothric boss fight music namely. The cast of NPC and the questlines were well done with some personalities being nice additions to the Souls series. To my understanding this will be the final entry in the Dark Souls franchise, so it was nice to have references and nods to the whole franchise, starting way from Demon's Souls. I enjoyed reading weapon, armor, spell and item descriptions, vaguely hinting at the players past achievements but the throwbacks don't end here, by far they don't. The blacksmith is the very same Andre of Astora from the first Dark Souls which surprised me since this is taking place apparently a long time after the events of the first game. While him being the single only major identical NPC, I still would have liked it more if he at least was a descendant. Ah well, it was breaking the immersion a bit. There is a fine line between recognizing heritage and recycling and for the most part it's thankfully the former but having seen all the content, there are areas where I would not blame someone for using the word ""recycled"". Anor Londo is actually not one of those though as it was a very small area, basically a run-up to a boss, so I was absolutely fine with its appearance. Most of all it did not feel like a cheap copy-paste but made sense in the lore and world. Time passed, so it was decaying and crumbling, very well done. Sadly though the existence of Silver Knights was not only done beyond a little nod but felt copied. They added few new attacks but they were the same old Silver Knights with the same old gear, not even brittled or broken to show signs of time! That was a big immersion breaker and I did not enjoy facing them which only became sadder at the amount. The area could have become much more memorable and impactful by making the Silver Knights wear broken, torn-apart armor, maybe even broken weapons and slower, less lively behavior. The way they are depicted though is not well done.Later on when you end up in the Untended Graves there is an interesting ""Aha"" moment upon realizing it's the starting area but that gets replaced by a ""Why"" moment when you realize it's not that the original area changed its tone and time but this is a parallel world/different area?! Dynamically changing the area from a certain point in the game would have been better. You fight a variant of the same boss and later on fight Black Knights. Similarly to the Silver Knights with almost no differences to Dark Souls 1 but worse as the location does not make much sense. Shame.Thankfully these ""recycled"" occurrences were not too much, so I could forget about them once hitting subsequent areas which did not have these issues at all. All in all, I am glad that the Dark Souls franchise is ending as I want to see FromSoftware build a new world with different mechanics, different ideas without expectations & shackles that come with a franchise. From a technical point, Dark Souls 3 has network issues which I have not encountered in previous games. Frequently summoned players become glitched, lacking any animations and just glide which makes for a subpar multiplayer experience. Same happens to the player as a summon in that no enemy or boss has any animations which made for several severely anti-climatic boss fights where this issue obviously occurred for multiple summons who could hammer on a glitched boss without any repercussions. It's not the majority of the multiplayer experience but happens more often than is acceptable.Other than that the game shows stutter. It was only mildly annoying and never became a major issue for me thankfully. What did bug me were the load times when browsing through the inventory. The larger images take a second to show which annoyed me.Despite the lengthy criticism, the positives outweigh them by a landslide and the ups are much, much higher than the lows. Dark Souls 3 is a very good Souls game and stands tall on its own with many of the most memorable and enjoyable areas and boss fights in the whole franchise. I am eagerly awaiting new content, so I have a reason to play more of this gem of a game.",1
Positive,"I don't know what to say about Dark Souls 3 that hasn't been said already. The game has an incredible atmosphere, and coupled with the soundtrack, it creates a very impressive play. The gameplay is probably what most people vouch for, and they are right, it is really challenging and very rewarding. I would definitely recommend the game, especially if you have friends who already have it.",1
Positive,"This is my little Christmas present to this amazing game: a plus one from me! This is possibly my favorite game of all time. TL;DR at the bottom if you don't want to read this long love letter. ~before we begin, a small definition~ Deification (de i fi ca tion | \ d - -f - k -sh n) (noun): 1. the condition of being treated like and considered to be a god 2. The act of making something into a god People often misunderstand the goal of Dark Souls. They think it is to beat the final boss and possibly achieve some comprehension of the vaguely told story. However, I say different. The goal of Dark Souls is not to defeat a boss, but to become a boss.In Dark Souls 3, you begin as a filthy undead that doesn t know which way is up. Your first challenger is Iudex Gundyr- another failure of a warrior, cursed to be in the same wastes you were resurrected in. When you defeat him, you begin the path from nothing to everything. Soon you run through a ruin of a cursed city, searching for the Lords of Cinder- far less failed warriors than Gundyr. As is stated in the game, they are not made Lords of Cinder for merit, but for might. When you have defeated all of them, you prove your superiority. POINT DOWN.Along your journey, you kill all sorts of outcast lords and warriors. You come across other players trying to complete their own journey- some you may kill, others may kill you. Some will become your allies. You ll find that in this brutal masterpiece of a game, allies can take you a long way. Even when they are your partners in crime- as invaders. Throughout your numerous interactions with them, you will learn things, obtain new items, and gain experience. At this point you will unconsciously begin to realize the goal of Dark Souls. 60-70 hours after your first victory over Gundyr, you will arrive at the final boss of the base game. Like before, you can go alone for an ultimate challenge to prove yourself or fight with your sunbros to fulfill the quest that the story has you chasing after.Then you will begin the DLCs, which have the better parts of the game in all aspects- the most interesting weapons, the most fun and well-designed bosses, the best part of the story (which is actually really good, it just takes effort to get into). The further you go into Dark Souls, the more challenging and of higher status your foes become. By the end, you travel to the Ringed City to finish the story of the whole series. This DLC has THE BEST bosses of the series, and is a must buy if you get this game.Then you are done with the first step of your journey. Some think they are finished when they defeat Slave Knight Gael , but no. You begin NG+, and the journey repeats, but with a twist- you now have your status from before; the overpowered weapons from the lords and warriors you defeated, the experience from fighting with and against other players, the levels from the time you invested. Also, up until NG+7, the damage and health of all enemies gradually increases. It s for this reason that I think NG+7 is the true ending of the game. The ultimate challenge, the final test of all that you have learned and accumulated. You see, Dark Souls is not about beating all the bosses, it s about becoming a master of the game. It s about ascending from a lowly hollow to a lord of Lothric or the bringer of the apocalypse or a PVPer who never loses. Dark Souls is about overcoming its massive difficulty again and again until you become a part of its challenge for future players. Dark Souls is about deification- the ascent to godhood. Become a god, and then you win.And then you have the undisputed right to POINT DOWN AT THOSE FILTHY CASUALS stop playing this extremely addictive game. One of the best RPGs of all time because you truly become a part of its world, and it's not by choice- in lures you in, forces you to defeat its challenges, and lets you slowly realize that you are the center of it all, that bettering your own skill is the true goal. Role-playing so damn immersive you actually aren't role-playing- you as the player are actually the whole damn point. A game truly dedicated to itself. Everything that defines a masterpiece.",1
Positive,A perfect mix between Bloodborne and Dark Souls. 10/10,1
Positive,"overall one of my favorite games ever, ive played 100 hours on ps4 but decided to switch to pc and am shocked by how much better the quality is",1
Positive,"Watched my kids play hours and hours of Dark Souls. They were very good. Game looked awesome. I love games. I own 300+. Kids said ""dad, you have to get Dark Souls."" I said ""I have to get Dark Souls."" I got Dark Souls. I've played 5+ Hours. Still haven't beaten the very first boss. Kids looking for new dad.",1
Positive,"Love it! Dark Souls 1 was my favorite, only due to the dark feel and story. While I enjoyed Dark Souls 2, my biggest complaint was that it never felt like it had any direction, or purpose to follow. Dark Souls 3 fixed that issue, while going back to Dark Souls 1's dark gothic atmosphere. While also bringing in so much awesomeness into the combat system, with the new stances and weapon arts, the game requires a lot more planning to break enemy shields and blocks, and PvP feels more indepth. Dark Souls 3, is easily my favorite of the 3 games. However, I will say that if you're coming to Dark Souls 3 for the PvP, and expecting a change in the latency, you will be disappointed. There are still huge delays when being invaded and having to fight someone. Another thing which bothers me, while not a major thing, is if you summon someone into your world for help, you WILL be invaded shortly after, which kind of sucks when all you're trying to do is kill a boss or something, the good thing is often you are 2v1, and can easily dispatch the invader.Either way, I give the game a 9/10, would be 10/10 if the latency issues were addressed.If you enjoyed ANY of the previous Dark Souls, you WILL love this one.",1
Positive,"Dark Souls III is a decent homage to the Souls series with some quality of life improvements here and there. It is a decent Souls game, though definitely not my favorite. -Be prepared that despite how much I enjoy this game, I do have a lot of criticism.-The areas of the game look beautiful and much more lifelike than in previous titles. Bosses are also incredibly memorable due to the variance in their design and movement. It s a bit difficult to say what I like about this game that is better than in other Souls games because there frankly isn't much. It s a solid title for the same reasons that the previous entries were. From Software played it fairly safe with this title. While Dark Souls I and II had some bosses or mechanics that were incredibly hit-or-miss, at least they attempted to things that were truly different. The last entry of the series felt like it had lost more than it gainedI greatly miss the existence of any kind of static poise like the previous entries had. Considering this title is much faster paced than the ones before I felt this game would have benefited the most from it.I personally don't mind how linear this title is, though I do wish the areas felt more interconnected with one another. Things like later areas having paths that return you to previously inaccessible parts of a previous area would have made the world felt much bigger and would have made exploring more interesting.Next is the new FP system. While the FP system changed how a player controlled the number of casts they could have, it really didn't do much to change the gameplay of spell-casting itself. While I admit the system makes pure spell builds more viable for PvE, it comes at the cost of making them almost too strong in PvP depending on the build (if you've fought a lightning arrow user, you know what I mean). Because of that I wouldn't say it does anything revolutionary or new.Weapon arts leave me with mixed feelings. I love the effects of certain weapon arts such as Champion's Charge from Gundyr's Halberd or the Sacred Light and Flame from the Twin Prince's Greatsword, the latter of which is my favorite weapon in the whole game. Sadly it feels like you can never truly enjoy weapon arts because they cost FP. Most weapon-based builds cannot afford to invest any levels into attunement. And because they fight at close range, they also cannot afford to prioritize any ashen estus over regular estus. I really wish they would have made weapon arts cost weapon durability instead as they did in the previous titles for unique attacks since durability can be replenished with repair powder and it would still prevent users from being able to spam weapon arts during a fight.My final gripe is also related to weapon arts because I feel their existence is the reason one of my favorite parts of Souls games is gone. There seems to be much less moveset variety among weapons than in previous titles. Sure some were broken, but I prefer broken over boring. In DS2 we had spears with attacks from 4 different movesets and greatswords that had straight sword movesets when 2-handed. So many weapons had unique properties like this that made them each so memorable, whereas in DS3 almost every weapon from a weapon class feels identical to use with only a few exceptions.I know I sound like I hate this game at this point, but I don't. My playtime alone should be proof that I love DS3. I love it for the same reasons I loved the previous two, it's just that I don't love it for many reasons outside of those. This game had a lot of potential that I feel it missed out on. This was made even more evident to me after playing the Cinders Mod. I honestly have little to no desire to return to vanilla apart from pvp since this is the only remaining Souls game with a large enough playerbase for such. I understand why From Software took the safe route for this game and don't blame them for it. It was a good decision if this was truly the last Souls title they plan to do. I only hope they will be more innovative in future titles like Elden Ring (keep in mind I have not had to opportunity to play Sekiro myself, but it seems to be a step in the right direction).",1
Positive,"Launch issues will not be discussed because FROM knows about them, and are already working to fix everything.What is Dark Souls III? This game is the next entry into the Dark Souls series, featuring the same 3rd-person RPG gameplay of it's predecessors. It takes place in the same world as the previous titles(though now in Lothric), and includes all the expected puzzles, traps, bloodthirsty enemies, complex/beautiful environments and secrets you could ever want. Dark Souls has a brand new engine this time around, the same as that of Bloodborne; you can really feel the difference in smoothness and graphic quality.Positives:The legendary difficulty is back(they patched it in before release).This installment easily has the most in-depth fighting system of the series.The lore and narrative are still puzzles in their own right, and there's a lot of it.The game is on par for PC options.Most areas will run at 60fps if your computer is within spec. The game is beautiful.Soul memory is GONE! WOOO! Also, enemies won't disappear after you kill them a bunch.The boss design, as usual, is on point. They are all unique, scary, and challenging.The soundtracks are amazing, they come to life in the game's best moments.The game start-to-finish without doing any side stuff takes an average of 30 hours.The level design is miles ahead of Dark Souls II, you'll notice that immediately.Veterans of the series will be familiar with most systems, like sliding into a new comfy chair.Combat has been entirely reworked, down to each individual weapon. Dual-wielding is viable!Classes don't lock you into a playstyle, choose what you want and build on it. You can respec too!PVP is better than ever, especially with the new covenants!Online functionality has been expanded.Based on the ending, this is probably not the final Souls gameNegatives:The world is kind of linear in some areas, but it's not very noticeable.There are a few framerate and graphical issues. Some areas are worse than others.There is noticeable pop-in.Some grinding is neccesary. (May not be a negative for you!)Keyboard and mouse controls are just okay(using a controller is highly recommended)(Yeah, that's it. Wow.)So is it worth it?A thousand times yes. This game takes the best of the previous games and expands upon them. The Souls formula has been entirely reworked, and outfitted with the new Bloodborne engine to deliver a beautiful, polished product. Veterans should feel right at home here, as everything they know and love is in the game waiting for them. Those new to Dark Souls will have no problem using this game as an entrance to the series, as this is really, truley, the ultimate Dark Souls experience.(Did you like this review? If so, please vote it up! Feel free to add me and check out my Steam Group.)",1
Positive,"The time has come for me to touch the pen again and write something about the game where I spent the good last weeks. I want to add that this review is based on my personal experience and opinions. The following review is also based on my only one playthrough of the game (including DLCs). I would also like to thank the person who bought this game for me, as well as the person who also gifted me the available DLCs.Before starting, I will state that I have not previously played any of the Souls games series or similar, which may have contributed to how I played and how far I came. But let's not beat around the bush, it is time to enter the world of Lordran, where the flame of life begins to dim.I will start the review by mentioning of what I have heard so much, and with which I personally did not have major problems. A lot of people have spoken in a environments where I'm active that the control are terrible. I played on the keyboard and mouse myself, so I do not know how it is on the pad, but the game allows you to change everything in options, although it is very intuitive by default and you can get a feel by the first two locations what to press to achieve the effect we intend to achieve. I would like to say that the character that I eventually played was a Pyromancy Knight, so I did not have much contact with what it is like being an archer, mage and so on.As for the interface of the game, it lacks a forced tutorial for the first time, because many things can be overlooked, and all this is caused by one of the biggest drawbacks of the game - all interface buttons are still shown as if we were playing on the pad. Not once in the game did I rate the messages, because I could not figure out which button suits it. Nevertheless, it did not prevent me from enjoying the game, when at the fingertips we have Souls' Wikipedia containing information about subjects whose descriptions are not very clear - and I really recommend reading these descriptions. I sold a special shield myself which increases the renewal of stamina, just because I did not read its description and that would help me a lot.As I mentioned earlier, this is my first contact with the Souls-like game, which is why I slowly began to understand how the gameplay looks like within those. The world of the game is limited to closed locations, and most of what we see is really amazing views, but more on that later. The game as a whole is one to two lined, where the task is to move through the mazes of rooms, corridors and swamps to unlock shortcuts, illusory walls or more bonfires, until the end we encounter a boss fight. Although for some people it may seem monotonous, all locations are diverse, thought out and work well together. The exploration through them is not so satisfying by the enormity of opponents which we have to repeatedly have to break - dying more often from the hands of monsters than bosses is a normal thing.The combat system in this game is almost precise, although you can complain about hitboxes of some weapons or monsters. based upon my game as a knight, wielding a light and a great swords was intuitive, however, everything was releated to the most important rule of these games - greed. Every opponent in this game is different, so an attempt to kill him immediately can only result in an unfortunate death. The most important is the analysis of what movements they do and the appropriate response time. Often, you must dodge a few times before you attack - and the DS3 game is very punished for greed in an flurry of attacks. However, when we have enough of opponents (although I recommend fight with lots and the unique ones for special loot), there is always an escape option which I used, and somehow I managed to root out through many locations until the next bonfire.In the world of Lothric a bell sounds, signaling the fading of the flame, which protects everyone from the infinite darkness. With the roar of the bell wake up the undead, whose task is to tame the Lords of Cinder and bring them to their thrones. That's all we learn from the intro of the game and, in fact, what we should remember, because during our wander we will not see such a development of the story. It exists in the world and it depends on us how well we will be exploring to discover secrets and know more about story of it all.If we're talking about story exploration, most of what we'll find out are side quests that are completely different from what you would encounter in other games of this type. Scattered around the corners of the world, NPCs offer us their services as long as we find them alive and we will not get through the game too fast. The slight problem is that during the first wandering, we can practically omit all side tasks through their complicated and multiple paths design, hidden from our eyes (Outside of beloved wikipedia) steps that we must do to be able to complete them. Rewards for tasks are usually the constantly increasing offers from buyers, however if we skip a well or do not look at every angle, it may turn out that we do not know the full potential of the game.I mentioned this part a few times in the previous parts of the review and it does deserve a separate category. The diamond upon the crown of this game is undoubtedly the bosses with whom we will face. From cursed trees, meetings with the Vatican and swordmasters, the diversity of bosses requires us to learn how they move, what attacks they perform, find a way to read the best opportunities for attack and how many of them can be done. Although many internet lists rate some bosses extremely low, I had a lot of fun against most of them, although I had to take a break from the game for a while to regenerate the batteries before fighting the last obstacles. Some fights are a bit short in the context of how easy they can be for many classes, though they can cause problems for others. A good example would be Ancient Wyvern, which is definitely one of my favorites, but it would be best if killing her would require two or three beats, each time with a different path taken. A couple of battles are also dependent on the roll of the dice, but I am fully aware that this is not something that happens only in the third part of the trilogy.Going toward the end of review, the second most precious gem of this game is this. Through catacombs, cities and valleys, all the locations we meet and explore during the game are beautifully constructed. Many of them merge with each other in intricate corridors, and in many places we can stand and for a good few minutes to enjoy the view, exactly like the first visit in Irithyll of the Boreal Valley. I would like to mention that in terms of design on the part of the game, some of the locations do not evoke such emotions, however, if you remove opponents only to be able to enjoy eyes, they would also find inner beauty.As we are talking about audio as well, I have to mention the music and sounds that fill the universe of this game. Although I have not experienced music in the normal world, which was an unpleasant surprise for me, the music that plays during the main menu or all bosses significantly compensates for it, when church choirs or massive instruments warm up in our interiors in order to overcome all difficulties.At the end of the review, I would like to say each of its aspects gave me great fun and I hope that I will find the strength to be able to continue my adventures. Certainly I will rate the game on solid 9/10, and this is only when it comes to the base game, cause there are still waiting recommendable DLC content, about which separate reviews do not plan to write due to lack of that much content and trouble to write off them like this, for now.",1
Positive,"This game is absolutely brilliant. From Dark Souls 2 to 3 is one of the biggest redemptions I have ever seen. DS3 doesen't have that much colour to it. The most you'll see is a few gradients of grey, brown and blue. And yet, the game is stunningly gorgeous. Absolutely beautiful. The combat, just like the first two games is relatively simple, yet very very rewarding. The bosses are some of the best I have ever seen in any game. Especially the DLC bosses, they are on another level. The level design is great, but is missing a bit of interconnectivity, somehting I feel makes a world feel more real. The soundtrack is phenomal. Almost every track has a hint of melancholy to it, and thats what makes it beautiful in my eyes. It's bittersweet. This game is in my opinion the best Dark Souls game and is what truly sells the trilogy. A fantastic masterpiece, with many fantastic aspects. However, there is one glaring issue with this game I cannot ignore. The trophy hunting. When I'm trying to platinum a game, I want it to be a challenge. But not in the way this game does it. If you want all achievments for DS3 you need to put in a tedious amount of hours into farming. It's so annoying and takes so needlessly much of your time. It's such a boring way to drag out the game, and I don't know why they made it this way. Other than that, this game is a fantastic way to send off the trilogy of Dark Souls and is one of my favorite games of all time. Thank you Fromsoft.",1

Positive,"Dark Souls III is glorious that is beyond dispute. Some feel allured by its combat mechanics and challenging nature; I felt drawn in by the clandestine lore, sombre, dying world, soothing voices and, of course, grandiose music.Yet whilst contemplating the wonders of genius loci, I oft strayed and started poring over helpful texts and therein I discovered the mob. Should one dareth to voice their dissent, their skill would be called in question. In unison, the mob shall mockingly set ablaze any blemish tarnishing perfection. Their painted world must persevere.Truly, requires this game an inordinate amount of skill ? Dark Souls enforceth ways which provoke frustration and rage. It rewardeth thoroughness, keen senses, patience and nimble reactions. Ashes are in the dark, expected to crack open obscure hints most walk past blindly. One must employ mental fortitude and keep training; other than that, no especial ability is to be had. If one doth not compensate for weakness through amassing souls, all depends on dodging and remaining cool-headed.Refined aesthetes who delight in sipping the sorrows of complainers ought to consider some casters particularly struggle with the antiquated targeting system. As such, sorceries commonly fly opposite of the locked-upon enemy. Worse yet, focusing upon a draconic torso turneth the world around. For a collector, covenants constitute a nightmare as do items that vanish if one doth not venture the world in a specific order. And brawlers are ever at risk of being expunged due to nefarious invaders.Dost thou not love pain and suffering? Thou wert warned.",1
Positive,"Dark Souls 3 Is a magnificent game, just as all the other projects Miyazaki has been a part of. No Dark Souls game has disappointed me in the past, much the opposite actually, so of course my hopes were high when I first played this game. Long story short, no matter how high my hopes were, this game was able to surpass most of them.Dark Souls 3 decides to go back to It's root story telling, like in Demon Souls and Dark Souls 1. The game starts you off with a short premise, a short explanation, targets you need to defeat, and then throws you off in the world. Also going back to It's roots is the magnificent level design. Like always the areas in Dark Souls are all inertwined, rewarding the player for exploring around. Shortcuts that take you hours back, making everything more accessible and forcing you to memorize the areas so seamlessly. This way of universe building really enriches the gameplay experience and Dark Souls 3 without a doubt, delivers In that regard. A couple new classes have been added, and some removed, even bringing back the Pyromancer class, which I very much approve of. The humanity system Is a little different this time around. No Humanity or Human Effigy's but now you must use Embers. Embers will, just as the humanities, grant you the ability to summon/be invaded. Your max HP does not suffer small penalties from each death as It does in Dark Souls 2 but when an Ember is used, your max HP bar grows massively, as well as healing you, as It did in Dark Souls 1, but unlike Dark Souls 1, you may not consume an Ember after already using one. The humanity counter is long gone. (Good)In other words the Embers are the junction of all the good parts about the previous instalment`s ""humanities"". Which i very much approve of. Another notable difference are a couple new stats to upgrade. The most notorious; Luck. Luck does what you'd expect, It boosts your Luck, as a rusted coin would, but permanently. It's good for item drops. The covenants this time around also work much differently than the other games, and in my opinion for the better. In Dark Souls 3 you'll find around the world insignias for covenants, and you may at any given time, equipt which insignia you'd like. Each one of them of course, having their own benefit or draw back, regarding the type of playthrough you'd like to do. Some insignias are very easy to find, others almost impossible on your own without a walkthrough or someone telling you about their existence. Talking about walkthroughs, Dark Souls 3 continues the magical tradition of completely destroying you over and over and over and over. The combat system In Dark Souls 3 Is by far my favorite out of the others. It's much faster and the varietly is so much it can actually get a little overwhelming. This game introduces the weapon arts. Each weapon in this game has a special attack, which will take a little from you mana bar. (Also this game now uses a fucking mana bar which can be restored using a different type of estus. You'll have to balance your estus usage depending on the type of build you're making. The estus for you mana are taken from your max quantity of estus you have. This max number goes up just like in Dark Souls 2 when finding Estus Shards and returning to firelink. They did not go back to the kindle system of Dark Souls 1, so God Bless)The main Hub in Dark Souls 3 is very cool, It's not even close to be as good as Majula but It for sure has it's charm. The music is super relaxing and most of the time you just can't wait to get back and explore around the area. It would always feel great going back and finding a new npc there, or even some items that I didn't see before, even transfer boss souls, etc. But In all honestly it gets a little morbid later on, making it lose its relaxation feel, depending on how you play the game, of course.Oh and speaking of boss souls, unlike the other instalments, you may now transfer boss souls into weapons, shields, spells, miracles and rings from one of the lords of cinder, that stays in the main hub. Which Is a major convenienceBut that's actually the thing I DON'T LIKE about this game;IT'STOOEASYAlthough very excited when I finally was able to beat the game, I was also very fucking surprised by how fast I was able to beat it. I remember that the first time around playing Dark Souls 1 and 2 they took me around a week or two to complete just one playthrough, ending up to be around 60-70 hours of gameplay. I beat Dark Souls 3 In a couple days, ending up with roughly 30 hours of gameplay. All the bosses in this game, on the most part (LOOKING AT YOU WYVERN), are extremely well made, and very relentless, easily one of the best parts about it. But I never felt the same feeling I would always get while playing Dark Souls 1 and 2, the feeling of ""ooooh shit no no not right now what the fuck is this shit? this is impossible!?!?!"". Usually when playing Dark Souls 3, you just can't wait for the next boss fight cause you just want to fuck shit up, and yeah that's a great feeling, but the whole feeling of dread and knowing that you're not nearly as strong as you think you are, and that anything can just come and fuck you up at any moment the other games gave me really gave true meaning to those playthroughs. The feeling of overcoming such difficulties in the previous games where much more orgasmic.To compensate a little, the enemies is this game are usually a lot more relentless then the other instalments, even sometimes being a little frustrating, as If their stamina was infinite. All these enemies are dealed with easily If you thrive to attack them with the same aggresiveness that they have, other than staying on the defensive. Another MAJOR issue I had with this game was bonfire placement. There are literally bonfires that are less than 10 seconds apart from each other. I remember finding that very fucking stupid. Also a lot of fan service Is made in this game. The players that are more fond of the first Dark Souls game will most certainely be very much pleased with how the game plays. Areas from the first game come back, familiar faces and armour, many easter eggs and even weapons. To add in on the weapons, Dark Souls 3 decided to continue the dual wielding from Dark Souls 2 but makes It a little easier with putting both weapons for one slot. There are tons of weapons like this so you can go crazy. They also brought back the torch but actually made it as a weapon so instead of using the flaming butterflies and relying on that stupid time limit, just equip it as a weapon and you're more than ready to go. A great improvement. Poison also goes back to it's roots, not drying your whole HP bar in miliseconds like in Dark Souls 2. No more life gems. And they also decided to do the Dark Souls 2 bonfire mechanic of just lighting them up serve as a checkpoint instead of having to rest at one like in Dark Souls 1, which i appreciate. To end It up, Dark Souls 3 Is an amazing game. Lovers of the previous games will adore the adventure 100% guaranteed. Newcomers to the series, this game will for sure be a great starting point, for its the easiest, most beautiful, less cryptic, of the 3, and I love it!9/10lol jk theres no poise0/10",1

Positive,"So I am over 60 years old and fairly new to gaming in general. Jumping from Killing floor (fairly new at that also) to this gives you an idea. Before this it had been many years since playing ANY games(I owned an n64 back in the day). So, I am floored by this game. To me its amazing. I explore around sometimes doing nothing but looking around. I have gone through a fair amount of the story line - again - its all amazing to me. In short I love it. I now am branching to more games, as I find I enjoy playing more then one game at a time. I love the characters of this game, the visuals of it, and have no complaints. Occasionally I run across a very minor glitch of getting stuck or something, but this does not bother me. I do not expect perfection. But I want to emphasize this is very rare. Thank you fromsoft for making such an amazing game",1
Positive,"Dark Souls 3 is truly a masterpiece imo. let me explain why:- The soundtrack is nothing less than a fucking masterpiece. I even listen to it in my free time.- The gameplay is challenging enough to keep you on your toes and alert at all times.- The combat is a fucking masterpiece, especially the bosses. Boss fights are essentially duets with the boss performing a line and you having to answer appropriately otherwise you die. - With every boss fight you'll be dumbstruck by how amazingly thought out each one is. No two are exactly the same and each one has its unique own twist that forces you to adapt your playstyle accordingly- WAY too many games these days just hold your hand throughout the game, eager to show you all of its nooks and crannies. Dark Souls throws you in with a brief tutorial and a giant ""fuck you"" tattoo'd on your forehead before testing your metal against the first boss of Dark Souls 3 not even 10 minutes into the game.-Dark Souls kind of reminds me of Skyrim. You could be on your 8th playthrough and still find things you never knew even existed. - The lore is a whole new area to master with thousands of npc's and bosses who's stories intertwine in one way or anotherIn short this game is a fucking masterpiece and its well and truly worth the full pricetag.

Positive,"Just a fuc*ing LEGENDARY game. Very good game, nice lore, nice gameplay. I haven't seen any bugs, yeah, I'm pretty sure there is alot of bugs but I haven't seen them. I played this game something like a 100 real hours. And I can say it woithout a doubt: This is the BEST GAME EVER!Giant, sometimes almost immortal bosses, detailed open world, good lore. It's PvP there and an exellent combat system (better then For Honor's xD). I killed my FIRST boss after 2 hours of pain and suffering, but it was worth it, all that joy after the kill, I just can't convey it in words. I didn't killed a couple bosses, but I enjoed to play this game, it was alot of good time with a friend and some random people, it was a good time. At last I want to advise you to buy this masterpiece. If you have some friend or several friends, so you just MUST buy and play this game at least 20 hours. I want to warn that it's a lot of farm at the game, and don't take mage or pyromancer for the first time because it's too easy.| Enjoy this game just like I did :)",1

Positive,"Souls 3 was my first souls game. It took me some 3 hours, and 20-30 tries to beat the Gundyr, the first boss. The pure exhilaration of that final, triumphant victory hooked me for over 2 years, long after I beat the game and DLC's. I incredibly highly recommend the game to all who can afford it. Sadly nowadays the Online playerbase is mostly quiet aside from a few popular invasion areas/hard boss fights.If you strive for a challenge, this is one of the games. Ashen One, Be sure to bring more souls.",1
Positive,"A very rewarding yet unforgiving game, set in a dark fantasy world. Dark Souls 3 is or not one of the best Action RPGs out there. Having a lore-rich interconnected semi-open world, the game shows how it should be at its best. Fun boss fights, good soundtrack, beautiful environment, fun pvp, high replay value, and satisfaction from your own success are one of the many elements that this game has.10/10 buy it when whether its on sale or not. You will have your money's worth.",1
Positive,Absolutely enjoyed.wanna tell about the whole game but imma lazy guy :).as the last game of the series it ended up perfectly.loved everything. only disappointment is there is no free cam.cant take cool screenshots like wide angled ones.that's the only thing i dont like.although it would be a big APPLE cheese if the free cam was here isnt it XD.anyway totally worth for the price.so just grab it if u havent already.,1
Positive,"Excellent game , difficulty on point , multiple ending available , A huge world to explore Dark souls is known as a game to make gamers suffer and it won't change in the third one I would recommend that game only for hardcore gamers who want some challenge (better with co-op)",1
Positive,"If you're interested in Dark Souls, I recommend playing the first game first. Even though the remaster of the first game has it detractors, it runs wonderfully on both console and PC so please do not let it hold you back. DS3 has many callbacks to the first game, which made it much more enjoyable. This game does not need another positive review, but I'm going to throw my 2 cents in anyways even almost 3 years after release. Boss design is much improved over the first game. The bosses are hard, colorful and much more flashy on screen. Each boss really feels unique with no reskins like the first game (which had 3 demon bosses). I am not that good at these types of games, so I had plenty of time to appreciate each boss :) The art and environment are stunning and even the normal mobs have great detail. The only place that FROM seemed to have regressed since the first game is level design. It is so much better in the first game. This game, although more visually beautiful has a much more linear design, and the worlds do not feel as connected. Great game, and a great time to play it with Sekiro coming out this March.",1

Positive,"Just beaten it for the first time after beating Dark Souls 1 once and Elden Ring like 15+ times. Dark Souls 3 is now my favorite game in the series. Like sure a lot of bosses in the first half aren't that fun with a few exceptions like the abyss watchers, but the second half of the game is worth going through aldritch and the irithyll dungeon 100%. Dragonslayer armor, Abyss Watchers and Soul of Cinder are some of the best fights in the series and the only two fights that compare in elden ring are Maliketh and Godfrey.My main criticism is that because the game is so linear, you can't really get your build together quickly like you can in Elden Ring or Dark Souls 1. Depending on how you wann play, the game might just say ""beat half the game before you can use what you want"" and then you can't even play a different build and change it later, because that fails one npcs questline. So if you want to complete that, you can't respec and her quest is only complete after the second to last boss. For the first Playthrough I'd recommend a quality build where you level dexterity and strength equally. You will meet the stat requirements for a lot of weapons so you can just try anything out to see what you like.and use the ""talk"" option when talking to NPCs. They will usually explain important gameplay features and lore to you.anyways, 8/10 game. The first half is a bit underwhelming but consider it warmup for the second half that is insanely hard, but also where the real fun is found.I also look forward to trying the DLCs, which are just as good as the main game from what I've heard.",1

The bosses range from kind of easy to absolutely extremely horrific in difficulty, but that is what makes it exciting . You never know if you come across a boss that will devastate you or be not so bad. I am working slowly through the game after restarting because i had forgotten the mechanics of the game. Having a good time and feeling very excited when i finally beat a very difficult boss.The game runs well and has no issues in that area for me. Definitely a must play for souls players.

Positive,"After playing through Dark Souls 1, my co-worker gifted me Dark Souls 3, this time, I was very adamant on not being guided, though, and just given hints/tips to not ruin any NPC Side-Quests, which can be quite obscure. I've also beaten every single boss completely solo. I feel like Dark Souls 3 improves upon a lot of the aspects of the original, and I quite enjoyed it, even more than the first one. There's some very cool weapons, and tough as nails Boss Fights. My favorite one has to have been the Twin Princes, which I felt, was very satisfying to master, and I felt incredibly good after being them. I'm planning on playing through this game more in the future, trying out different builds and hopefully buying Dark Souls 2 as well soon.8/10",1
Positive,"Another Dark Souls and another 140+ hours gone. Here is my review broken up in different parts:As a PC port: pretty good, although I did experience BSOD multiple times. I hardly ever get this on other higher end games, including past DS games, so I suspect that this game was not 100% optimized for pc. Overall, it played well and I was able to get 4K, 60fps pretty easily. As a game: I absolutely recommend this game to anyone interested in action, adventure, RPGs, or metroidvania type games. It's totally good, often intense, and very engaging. I think the fighting mechanics are top-notch and there's so much variety in bosses, enemies, weapons that you can be entertained for a very long time. Whether you get it on sale or not, you won't be disappointed. It's absolutely worth the money. As a Dark Souls game: This is supposedly the last in the Souls series. I'd say overall it's the best, but only marginally. In fact, the innovation from 1 to 2 and 2 to 3 is pretty lacking. Don't expect a major shakeup in the DS formula. This is both good and bad for veterans of the series. It's pretty much the same game you played before, maybe with a few QOL improvements, upgraded graphics, and marginally better play mechanics. Unfortunately, they seemed to have streamlined the formula to the point where the only good weapons are swords and done away with DS2 dual wield function (which wasn't great, but at least it was there). So, in total, this is probably the best DS but honestly not that much of an evolution over the series. Criticism and praise: having played the series back to back in a relatively short time span, I can say that what makes DS great isn't really the fighting or the lore but the levels. The levels and the level design are a feature all to themselves. The masterful design and detail that made DS1 so great and was lacking in DS2 is back in full force in DS3. I absolutely love when levels open up with interesting nooks and crannies and eventually double back on to themselves with clever shortcuts and secret passages that make your progression worth the danger and risk. DS3 is at its finest in these moments. Also, the detail given to each level, all the little features that you can interact with (i.e., break) are excellent and give the levels a life of their own. Some levels in this game are done better than others, but overall all they are beautiful and fun to play through. I would have preferred a little bit more variety (you play through no less than 4 different graveyards) and maybe some totally different locations from past games (just like the past 2, you visit churches, castles, a swamp, and a run down village) but I guess that is what DS is about. The worst criticism I have with this game is that there is a very thin story that I found uninteresting and uninspired. Yes, DS has always been about digging deep to learn the lore and finding story details sprinkled in item descriptions or cryptic dialogue, but you'd think by the 3rd entry, they'd at least be able to build on the past games to give some semblance of a coherent story. That's just not the case here. In fact, it got to the point where I was running from boss to boss not knowing, or even caring, who they were are why I was doing this. Hell, I don't even know why I was killing most of the bosses in the game. Was it to the light the fire at the end? Was it to stop a curse? I still don't know. It's a shame that they couldn't build on what happened in the past games to make a story that answers all the questions and gives some finality to the series. Instead, you basically end this game just like you did with the other two. Again, this is a good port, a good game, and a good DS game. I just wish they did a lot more than make a Dark Souls 3.0, because that is what it feels like.",1
Positive,"+Good art design. Cool lore.+Polished combat. More forgiving than previous ones but harder to catch up with it because it is faster. +There are many ways to make the game easier for you, from usable items to different builds, magic and weapons.+Good item, armor and weapon variety.+Smart level design, which encourages you to try different things gameplay-wise. It also uses visual story-telling, so most of the things don't look out of place. (unless it is designed to be)+Good enemy variety.+Pretty graphics and animations.o The story is kinda obscure like older games. Which certainly gives it a charm.o It is easy to miss some NPC interactions. But they add replayability.o PVP and Co-op is a little too disconnected to the main game. Covenant rewards are pretty hard to get and not that cool. Some enemies and bosses are too easy with co-op even though some of them react accordingly with more AoE attacks. But they're still features and it's fun to play with people.o The dodge is powerful so it helps with faster builds while making slower builds relatively worse.o Shields are not good.- Dodge is too powerful for the PVP. It is mostly a shit show. It becomes too chaotic and invasions can take forever.- Armor is mostly fashion. Heavy armor does not justify dmg absorption. Poise is not affected by armor anymore(at least not enough it makes any difference). Especially when rolling is this strong. Shields are useless, so some builds are not good as they used to be. There was some gameplay value in the previous games which is not here anymore.- There are places where the game feels inconsistent. A weak looking enemy not staggering when hit while a big guy can't stand against you. A mob spamming his best move. AI pathfinding freaking out. To be fair the game is about observing the enemy before acting so it does not affect the gameplay horribly.- Some bosses are either too weak and/or don't feel special.- Mouse support is not that good but they tried.This game is not perfect but it is perfect with its flaws. It is aware of itself and does not pretend to be something it is not. The PVP and Co-op are not that good but you have to go out of your way to use them anyway. The armors are bad, but it is not like you can upgrade them like in DS1, they don't make you feel like armor is that important. Those bosses who don't feel special are not really special anyway. They're dudes who happened to be in your way. This game is a complete experience, this game is difficult, it does not hold your hand and it becomes way easier when you figure it out like every game should be. It is never unfair, it is either you or your character not suited for that part of the game. Use your items, upgrade your items and abuse the systems of the game. The game will not feel cheated if you abuse it as it tries to abuse you constantly. Play it at your pace, don't hit your head against the wall, try to go around it. And if you feel like you don't want to find another way, you can still do it your way but it might be way harder. It is okay to be upset if things don't work out, but if you don't like to get upset at times, there won't be any relief when you beat the challenge. So get ready for that.DLC REVIEWS:-Ashes Of Ariandel: Short but fun. It is worth it but does not cut it when it comes to surprising you. It has 2 nice bosses, but nothing really new. Mostly some generic enemies and a beautiful map. The painting has its own story, but it is not as interesting as the rest of the game because it feels disconnected.-The Ringed City: This DLC would be really good if it was not bullshit level hard. High HP and DMG enemies all around. One of the bosses (the optional one) is like something from WoW or a JRPG. It takes a while to bring him down as he can pretty much one shot kill you instantly. Other than that, it is pretty cool because it keeps on giving. It surprises you with traps that you have never seen in Souls series before. It shows you bits of unseen lore about the order of the Dark Souls universe. The Dark Souls series end. But these games are never about when you get there anyway. It's always the climb.",1
Positive,"Sprawling level design, thrilling combat, and masterful indirect storytelling make Dark Souls 3 the best Dark Souls yet!",1
Positive,"The game is good however you look at it. The engine is the newest of all Souls games (based on Bloodborne's), graphics, music, environments, everything is top-notch. Bear in mind that because of the said engine combat is faster paced compared to Souls 1 and 2. While there are still shields and they are viable the emphasis this time around is on rolling and dodging. (I haven't played with a shield so I cannot tell with confidence how good is the shield play.) The story is decent but most importantly it puts an end to the saga in a satisfying way while it manages to keep the world fresh by adding more lore and mythology at the same time. Make sure you play both DLCs as they are crucial to some of the deeper lore that's been seeded way back into the intro movie of the original Dark Souls.PvP is fine but with the poise debacle it's ruined for me. Poise was a good mechanic, alas FromSoftware couldn't balance it so they turned it off completely. It's a shame really. Covenants are very fun this time around, probably the best implementation of all three games.If you've played at least Dark Souls 1, Dark Souls 3 is must.",1

Positive,"Ever since I got my hands on Dark Souls 3 I was simply transfixed. All of my waking hours have been spent in an endless pursuit of souls to further grow my collection of fancy weapons, and despite praising the Sun I don't remember the last time I've seen it. I have become something alike the hollows that roam the land, utterly consumed by Dark Souls 3.At this point its fairly well known that Dark Souls 3 is good, but I don't think simply 'good' does it justice given that I am currently thinking long and hard on whether Dark Souls 1 is still my favorite game of all time. So what exactly makes Dark Souls 3 so compelling, and how does it match up against the entirety of the extended Souls family?The first thing one will notice with Dark Souls 3 is that its an evolution of all the concepts found in previous games, with the biggest influence coming from Bloodborne, what with the numerous dilapidated hamlets, dirty villagers driven mad by things far beyond their understanding, and a constant oppressive aura that spreads throughout the majority of locations. The combat is another good example as its much, much faster than what you might find in Dark Souls 1 and 2, while still retaining that slow, methodical pace we've all come to love about the Souls series.Naturally, since we as the players get better character handling, faster dodge-rolling, and overall superior combat mechanics, the monsters get their own set of upgrades as well. They are far more aggressive than in previous games, able to chain multiple attacks in order to punish you for expending your stamina, and most importantly, a fair bit smarter than the bunch that precedes them, though they still have issues grasping the concept of doors.As for the encounter design, I believe Dark Souls 2's catch phrase fits here rather well: Prepare to die! After seeing players stomp all over their games for a couple of years now, FromSoftware have stopped pulling punches, and have designed enemies and locations in such a way that they will often punish the unwary traveler, while simultaneously greatly rewarding those that think outside of the box.While Dark Souls 3 may be a brutal mistress, it does love you, so almost every time it horrifically murders you, throws you off a cliff, or has rats gnaw on your kneecaps, it also gives you a bonfire shortly afterwards, both as an apology, and as a reward for a battle well fought. The end result of this sort of level design is that I never felt pissed off after dying, instead I would keep all of my anger bottled up within me for the 30 seconds it took to run back to where I was, promptly go medieval on whoever killed me, die again because I was reckless, and then finally decide to try and approach the situation like a sane person.But perhaps the best encounter-related feature of Dark Souls 3 is that the dreaded puzzle bosses, ie. bosses that require you to deal with secondary mechanics besides simply fighting them, are for once interactive, and most importantly, fun to do. My favorite example of this is a boss fight that occurs relatively early in the game against a Wizard that is weak on his own, but is capable of spawning powerful illusions from the crystals he throws around everywhere. Instead of simply smashing his face in like you would with Pinwheel from Dark Souls 1, you will need to actually deal with the crystals by choosing on the fly which ones to destroy, and which ones to ignore as you endlessly pursue a boss that likes to run away and laugh at you. The final thing I want to mention is the exploration as the open-ended levels from Dark Souls 1 and Bloodborne are back with a vengeance. There are secrets and side-areas almost everywhere, so much so that despite considering myself an obsessively thorough explorer I managed to completely miss one boss, a fact that a friend who never even touched Dark Souls 3 pointed out to me when he noticed a hillside path I managed to completely gloss over. Worst of all for my sanity, I've found exactly one secret wall, which is just enough to let me know that they exist, and that I've probably missed dozens!There is so much more I want to talk about, but this review is already running long, so allow me to simply end with this: After playing Dark Souls 3 non-stop for the past week, the only thing I am currently looking forward to is playing even more of it. After all, I have to go back and beat the living daylight out of the damn knight that has managed to best me over a dozen times now, because as everyone knows, if you don't beat someone at first, you keep throwing bodies at them until you do!If you're interested in a more detailed review, I welcome you to either check out the written version I've done:http://www.gamesear.com/reviews/dark-souls-3-detailed-review-from-a-long-time-fanOr the video review that backs everything up with some pretty pictures:",1
Positive,"I'm a true gamer now.In all honesty, I confusingly enjoyed this game with a love/hate relationship, playing this game was enjoyably difficult but each death made me want to progress further to beat the game. It pushed me to do better the next time, which this game tests the patience of only few people. I picked this game up mid last year, played and defeated Gundyr, and then I just couldn't bring myself to challenge anymore. I dropped it and didn't pick it up again til 4 days ago from writing this review and I am happy that I did. The game in short is about the protagonist finding and returning the five lords of cinder to link the flame which basically means the player encounters various enemies and bosses throughout the game with different playstyles, abilities etc. The game is gorgeous and the cinematics are great to watch. Some bosses are definitely better than others design and control wise since some enemies are boring or too easy like Wyvern, Deacons or feel a bit broken like Two princes, minibosses.The game is enjoyable and the progression feels very player based allowing them to combo and upgrade to their preference with armor, weapons and upgrading the player with souls. It feels very open compared to other video games but this game is both very difficult and easy. The game feels like it has too many bonfires, like when defeating dragonslayer, there is a bonfire just ahead in sight making it quite pointless and unneeded to have that many at times. I feel that the game slowly becomes easier because the player is more experienced with the gameworld and enemies, their reactions and character behaviour to weapons and armor. The game is difficult but the improvement of the player makes the game easier. This doesn't however cover all since bosses like nameless knight and pontiff sulvyvahn will give difficulty no matter what (in my opinion).In conclusion, this game could go through a few tweaks since hitboxes seem a little off and walls need to act like walls rather than enemies being able to stick their spear or sword through and hit me. I also feel like the frost knight miniboss is very overpowered and the only way to defeat him is by cheesing the elevator or having him stuck on the staircase. The game is enjoyable and the lore is very indepth, the game I feel is very balanced but remove a few bonfires since it takes away how some parts are easy and the game looks great. Really enjoyable first souls game and I hope to pick up the others soon to play and experience them!8/10",1
Positive,One of the best!,1
Positive,"*favourite game of 2010-2020*This game made me feel like i was exploring a complete universe. Not complete as in ""every person walking around the main hub world is loudly complaining about the next big boss I have to go kill but only after obtaining the next item found in the chest and the weapon skill from the old man"" blah blah blah blah. Not complete in the way that there are 500 NPC's and they all live in houses that contain the exact same dinner table, bedside table and family dog. Dark Souls 3 says FUCK YOU to that kind of game play and it plops you down in Sam Raimi's ARMY OF DARKNESS (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHZQEtG8xYo). While games like Skyrim and Witcher 3 are ""huge"", they can break immersion with issues like strange enemy placement, before-mentioned chatty NPCs everywhere, and these cut-and-paste assets littering the world. Here are my PRO/CONS for all of the TL:DRsPROS-EXTREMELY ATMOSPHERIC WORLD. Beautiful.-Amazing enemy/boss mechanics and design. (mini pro: Horror fans like should delight as well)-Clean, clean, clean gameplay. Crisp hit boxes. Don't swing a large sword in a little hallway, just like in real life. ""oh but muh gameplay"" yeah but MY REALISM IS SUSTAINED.-Good RPGness. Truly infinite ways to approach the world and bosses. Want to role play as an elegant woman who fights with a rapier, but after dying many times adopts a more sinister guise as a hollowed phantom who fights with a sytche? Want to play as a barbarian who discovers the basic magical arts of the flame, and then grows into a strong, passionate pyromancer who helps others a WARRIOR OF THE SUNLIGHT (a PVP/PVE covenent)? Want to play as an Old Wizard/Witch who wants to explore the arcane arts by whatever means necessary? Want to play as an actual White Knight, protecting your online PVP waifus? Want to just say fuck it, and LITERALLY roleplay as Guts from Berserk with his actual sword? Yeah you can do that.-Fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun PVP/Co-op-Difficulty can be offset by summoning people online for bossesCons:-This game demands your attention, and if people don't approach it with an adaptive mindset then it is ""HARD GAME HARD GAME HARD GAME TOO HARD WHERE IS EASY MODE SHIT GAME"". Yeah, if you are sitting at your rig at 2:00 taking a couple of bong rips, drinking whatever weird IPA, YEAH, maybe you might die a couple times if you DON'T EVER ADJUST YOUR GAME PLAY. Same token: If you approach Dark Souls 3 the way you would approach a boss in baby games like Ocarina of Time (that is to say, acting like you'll be able to survive long to find the bosses super exploitable weakness) yeah, then you'll get squashed like spaghetti.-Overrated difficulty (THIS IS MY REVIEW AND THIS IS WHAT I THINK). When people are speed running this game with guitar hero controllers, guess what:you are approaching the game wrong if you can't beat it. The first boss of BOTW I approached (i think it was the camel? the boss killed me with a billion lasers? I had like 4 hearts and died about 15+ times, WHERE IS THE OUTRAGE FOR THAT? If 12 year olds can beat breath of the wild, you can beat a dark souls game. Nothing in this game is really that hard if you keep levelling up and you try a simple build. I have made about 5 characters and the game gets easier each time. -can't marry the firekeeper(I would recommend playing dark souls remastered AFTER dark souls 3. It is nice this way.)",1
Positive,"I like the game, there is no denying that, especially since I m close to finishing my fourth playthorugh, yet I can t be ignorant just because of that. The greatness of every component that makes Dark Souls III is crippled by its poor technical execution and I m afraid this is a result of the fans and journalists attitude towards the game. Praising without questioning has given the developers a free pass with the end result being countless bugs and problems that went unfixed throughout an entire series making their way into its finale. Dark Souls III is a good game that combines most of the great elements of its predecessors into one final blow. The impact of the finale is subject to each gamer perception towards the series. In my case, I said that the best way to improve on the series is to find the balance between its two predecessors while focusing on fixing the problems of the past and Dark Souls III did only half of that. How important each half is? I guess the time spent playing the game can be interpreted as an answer to that.Pros:+ Impressive artistic design+ Epic soundtrack+ Mysterious and captivating story+ Good level design+ Refined combat system+ Greatest roster of boss battles and the best difficulty curve in the series+ Atmospheric+ Good itemization+ Fun PvPCons:- Bugs from the previous games made it into this one with new additions- Some issues with mouse & keyboard- Linear world design with a few exceptions- Perhaps too much fan service- The graphics quality and graphics related problems- Little incentive to continue with NG+ and onwards- Weapons balance issues due to Poise stat having no effect- The lack of proper support for the Online component- Annoying lag in Online playRead the full review at:http://thegameslashers.blogspot.ro/2016/05/dark-souls-iii-review.html",1
Positive,In some aspects Dark Souls 3 is better than Elden Ring. Excellent Game! Must Play!,1
Positive,"The best game experience I've ever had <3Some points here:- Was my first souls-like game ever.- Had obviously swallowed me therefore the 100% completion- On par with Elden Ring which I've recently started. More ""vanilla"" different kind of niche!20 / 10 !",1
Positive,is good buy it,1
Positive,"This is one of those games that you'll always remember even after playing it several times. Yes, is that good enough. You feel like a fly against huge bosses that will rip you apart. To be fair, you can summon warriors from other worlds (another player) and make the game easier, but hey I didn't summon any player in my world, I'm a little crazy. I like to help people kill their bosses and get extra souls so I can level up.The graphics of this game are nice, but what really is amazing are the locations, such beauty and gorgeous landscapes. The story isn't a strong point, you have to read a lot about item descriptions, but the gameplay is what is most important in this game and the ability to play new game plus.I give this game 5/5, really loved playing it and getting all the achievements.",1
Positive,"Ashen One,You possibly might die around hundred times, but that won't break your spirit to kick that angry boss face-off. This game requires patience, strength and tactical mind, then you will achieve anything that you want.Talking about the game comparing to ds1/ds2-Beautiful graphics-Mind blowing story line-Amazing PVP-Weapon system and combatTalking about those Anor Londo nostalgic moments - makes you remember those DS1 painful moments of catching arrows etc.Possibly after finishing this game I'll try to make another build like dexbuild+miracles and those hours that I've spent on this game - no regrets!Thanks, for making this gamew/ love",1
Positive,"Update - This is by far the best Souls game compared to any ohter such games that FromSoft has made. My ranking goes as follows :-Dark Souls 3 >> Bloodborne > Dark Souls 1 > Sekiro > Elden Ring > Demon Souls > Dark Souls 2I recently finished Bloodborne, and it comes very close to Dark Souls , but it is not euql to it, because of just one thing- non-replenishable health regen items . I mean, I want to enjoy the boss battle, not take a detour to farm for Blood Vials to heal myself. The only drawback of Dark Souls 3 is the run up to the boss, which is somewhat tedious and time taking. I love the game so much that despite having completed the game on PC sometime in 2017. I bought the game again for my newly purchased PS5. -Review as on 2017 :-This was my First ever Souls game.On killing the first enemy(not the boss),I kind of felt,""Is this the game that seemed to be so difficult.""Upon encountering the first boss,""This game was not meant for me.""Now,having beaten this game,I wanna play the entire series.P.S-Game content intended for matured players,not for Weak Hearted and Patientless people.If you are reading this,then dont forget to:""PRAISE THE SUN""",1
Positive,This game ruined other RPG titles for me due to how good it isBut the DLC bosses ruined my personal wellbeing11/10,1
Positive,Better than Elden Ring,1
Positive,"Dark Souls 3 is a game that could be described as a love letter to masochists everywhere. If you ve ever wanted to experience the thrill of victory followed by the crushing defeat of being stomped by a giant, flaming dragon, this is the game for you!At first glance, Dark Souls 3 is a beautifully crafted world filled with stunning landscapes and terrifying monsters. It s like a medieval art gallery that decided to throw a party but forgot to send out invitations. You ll find yourself wandering through dark castles, creepy swamps, and even a few places that look like they could use a good cleaning. Seriously, who needs a maid when you have undead knights lurking in every corner?The combat is where the game shines or should I say, where it gleams like a freshly sharpened sword ready to stab you in the back. The controls feel tight and responsive, which is great because you ll need to dodge, roll, and possibly perform an interpretive dance to survive. One moment you ll be feeling like an invincible warrior, and the next, you ll be flat on your face, wondering how that giant boulder managed to crush you without even breaking a sweat. It s like a game of hide and seek, but the seekers are out for blood, and they know all your hiding spots.Now, let s talk about the bosses. Dark Souls 3 serves up some of the most epic confrontations you ll ever face if by epic you mean a battle that will have you questioning your life choices for hours. From gigantic, multi-armed beasts to terrifying sorceresses who can turn you into a puddle of regret, each boss is a unique challenge. Just remember, the key to victory is to learn their patterns if only they didn t change them on a whim! It s like they re trying to teach you a lesson in humility, and boy, do they succeed.The story is another layer of the experience. It s there if you look for it, hidden like a secret room behind a wall of pain and suffering. You ll pick up bits and pieces of lore as you go, and while it s intriguing, you might find yourself more focused on surviving than piecing together the narrative. Who needs a plot when you have the thrill of being chased by a horde of undead?Now, let s talk about the DLC. The additional content is like a cherry on top of a very painful sundae. It adds new bosses, areas, and gear, but also ramps up the challenge to levels that might make you question your sanity. Achieving 100% completion feels like a full-time job where the only benefit is the sweet, sweet taste of accomplishment. And let s not forget that you ll likely need to tackle New Game Plus at least two more times to unlock everything. Because why not torture yourself a little more, right? But deep down, I know I ll dive back in, because the thrill of the challenge is just too enticing.Overall, Dark Souls 3 is a beautifully crafted game that rewards patience, skill, and maybe a bit of insanity. If you re looking for a game that will challenge you to your core while simultaneously making you laugh (because you ll need it after dying for the hundredth time), then grab your sword and get ready to embrace the darkness. Just don t forget to grab a snack your next play session might last longer than you think!And despite all the pain, the suffering, and the endless dying, I give Dark Souls 3 a solid 10/10. Because in the end, it s not just a game; it s a masochistic journey that we re all secretly here for!",1
Positive,Beautiful Game <3,1
Positive,11/10 would die again,1
Positive,"Overall:Everyone already knows Dark Souls, but don't let its reputation scare you away. These games are not overly difficult. They are punishing, but are (mostly) fair. You will die quite a bit, but don't be discouraged. If you're looking for a tough but fair RPG, there's no better series. And I believe Dark Souls 3 to be the best of them. The combat is the most fluid and fast paced in the series, and has some of the best boss battles I have ever experienced. There is a lot of weapon variety, and there are many possible character builds. There is a new feature, combat arts, which are attacks unique to each weapon that add some depth to the combat. The game will not disappoint in the gameplay department. Furthermore, the game looks and sounds very good. Some of the environments From Software have created are breathtaking, such as Irithyll. Each boss also has its own unique orchestrated music track that makes taking down these foes feel all the more epic and satisfying. If you have any interest in the series, I highly recommend you give this game a shot. Online:The online components of this game are mainly Invasions and Co-op summons. Invasions are fun, but can be very unbalanced. Co-op summoning is fun if you want help getting through a tough area, or if you want to play with a friend. You can also let other players summon you to assist them. The PVP arenas also provide a good amount of value, but they are DLC exclusive. In the arena, you can fight 1v1, 2v2, or 3v3 battles against other players. You can also fight in 4-player or 6-player free-for-alls. *Some people have reported cheaters messing with their games and banning them from online play, but I have not encountered any myself.*DLC:The first DLC Pack, Ashes of Ariendel is a bit short, but ends off with one of the best bosses in the game. The Ringed City is longer and has boss battles of similar quality. The Ringed City is a fitting sendoff for the series. I found both DLC packs were worth the money, but if you could only pick one, I would get the Ringed City (Although once again I do recommend the season pass). Getting either DLC pack will give you access to the arena.",1
Positive,"After almost 2 years since FromSoft gave us DS3,there is no true challenger for this game.The single player experience is unique with great areas and hard boss fights.Pvp is very good and again FromSoft add for us some advanced mechanics (and i'm not talking about weapons art) makes it's very interesting.Overall Dark Souls 3 is a must have for players who want's more challenge in their experience of playing a game",1
Positive,"this was my first ever souls game that i had ever played and beaten. This game is insanely good. The music, the enemies, the bosses and the npc's are so well written and unique that its hard to compare a game this good to anything else. The last boss fight made me so anxious and when i finally killed him after a couple of tries, it was a feeling unlike any other game has given me before. 10/10",1
Positive,Slave Knight Gael is the greatest Souls boss ever. A suitable ending to this greatness of a series.,1
Positive,"I just finished this game which is my first souls game, and I just had to write a review for it. Before I start, I have to say that if you are planning to buy this game, you should buy it ASAP because my biggest regret is not discovering this game sooner.This was a very fun game in my opinion in terms of its skill cap. It was very fun clearing areas finding new items and beating the mobs that would stand in your way. Exploring the beautifully designed world of Lothric is also always worth because of its amazing aesthetic. The weapons system was also quite enjoyable to me because discovering new swords, armors and spells always opened my options to more character customization and broadened my view on more ways to play the game. In regards with the bosses, they gave me a whole load of happiness by doing them. I found it fun learning how to fight them, to dodge their attacks and learn their weaknesses in order to succeed. Each boss victory, with the exception of the relatively easy ones, gave me always gave me extremely happy leaving me with feelings of accomplishment. With the lore however, I found that the game itself actually doesn't give you much details. You would have to watch a couple of youtube videos to learn it. This doesn't mean though that the lore isn't good. The lore for me is very exciting and fun. The story and the world of Dark Souls is in my opinion one of the best in all the games I have previously played.For anyone who reads this, I hope you find this review useful.",1
Positive,"hard and fun, you don't need a controller like everyone says. Use whatever you're more comfortable with.",1
Positive,"Just beautiful, nothing wrong with this game. Best with sunbros!",1
Positive,It truly has been a journey.This game has made me experience all the emotionsand gave me many fond memories of the strange and wonderful people I met along the way; including both NPCs and players. Dark Souls will forever be something special to me and is the type of game where there is always more to explore in this beautiful melancholy world. I await Miyazaki's next Masterpiece and until then I'll continue to fight my battles sword in-hand; thus I highly recommend this game.,1
Positive,This game has a special place in my heart. Such a thing of beauty.,1
Positive,"You know, I initially planned on just finishing this game just once with the Ursurper of Fire ending, aka the best one, then move on to Elden Ring, which y'know, reasonable.Here I am, on my third run as John Sekiro after finishing Sekiro, Sharp Uchigatana +10 only, parry as much as possible. I am addicted. I haven't even touched Elden Ring yet. Please stop me. I am too hooked.I am not good with analyzing details of games, I'd rather have fun and experience them. So here is the gist of my first-time experience with this game.FromSoft is world-class in terms of worldbuilding and setting the atmosphere. Even in the gameplay, I felt uncertain heading towards the next area, afraid that my weapons or stats will not even be feasible. But then I just kept on heading onward. And man, the feeling of barely scraping by and surviving endless counters gets my heart pumped. Early game Dark Souls experience are always unmatched in terms of uncertainty and ambiguity for your experience up ahead.As I progressed through the game, I got more gear/armor/magic, leveling up my character little by little, it was maybe baby steps but I was getting more powerful, I was improving myself as a player. I started to recognize enemy patterns, I was able to fully read Lothric Knights' moveset. And you know how fast their movesets are lol, really overwhelming at first. I was stuck at Dancer at one point and I kept going back to challenge her every time i upped my weapon stats or soul level. I did not give up, I knew I was improving because I started to be able to dodge through her attacks and read what she was able to do next. It f e l t s o g o o d.Anywai gud game git it, even if it never goes on sale. It's still worth it full-price. Fromsoft deserves your hard-earned cash.",1
Positive,"Dark Souls 3 is pretty cool, I guess.You play as an Ashen One, a champion destined to defeat the lords of Cinder and link the first flame, a sort of beacon that keeps the light in the world while at the same time keeping the darkness at bay.I think.After beating up a large man with a coiled sword in his stomach and a very angry tape worm living inside him, you find yourself in a temple called the Firelink Shrine, which is looked after by this cute lady that has a very long list of chores for you to complete while you're out. The Firelink works as your home of sorts, it's the generally safest place and all of your friends live there. But it doesn't have a couch or broadband internet, you could probably sit in one of those giant chairs that one of the lords of Cinder used to sit in, I guess. I can't really go into much detail about the plot without spoiling a lot of things, so instead I will dance around talking about it like I'm playing the floor the lava. Dink Rolls 3, like it's predecessors, is an action RPG in the same vain of games like Blade of Darkness and Crusader: Might and Magic. While making your character, there are a multitude of options outside of just making them look like Gargamel from the Smurfs. You can choose where this character comes from, which doesn't do anything but change the general back story and appearance, but you also get to pick a starting class. In the long run, and much like a communist state, class doesn't really matter, but it can be used to give a head start to whatever stats you actually want to level up during the course of the game.Combat handles almost like two mustached gentleman having a boxing match, unless you're fighting one of the many monsters that lie in wait, in which case in turns into you hoping that it doesn't try to eat you with its horrific chest mouth. Your characters left and right arm are assigned by default to the triggers or bumpers on your controller or to your mouse. You can also lock on to your enemy so you can strafe around them and you don't end up being smooshed because your shield just so happened to be pointing the wrong way. There is a surprising amount of diversity to the combat, you can play as a shield bearing knight or SHOTGUN WIZARD to be sure, but the equipment and stats really help how you shape your play style. You can just go it as a knight or mage, sure, but weapons are assigned to your hands rather than your character itself like other RPGs. Putting a staff or a charm in one hand and a sword in the other will allow you to cast spells as well as whack anything that gets too close, just like using a shield in both hands will let you block doorways for others and giggle at them like the massive jerk you are. Drake Souls 3: Hotline Bling also has this neat online feature like it did in the other Souls games. Others playing the game can leave messages that can warn, inform, or screw with others. The game will also leave blood stains on the ground to show you where other chumps had died so you can either avoid the danger or stand in amazement at how some people can get killed in this game. But most prominent, and arguably most important, is the coop and PVP features in the game. While embered, which is this games equivalent of having humanity, you can find summon signs on the ground that allows you to summon others into your game. This other players will help you defeat the area and it's boss in return for an ember upon success. Or more than likely they'll be killed in your place so you can trek on while they make a splat on the floor. Kind of like a Loony Toons episode. But maybe you aren't going to be a helpful little ghost that beats up monsters for others. Maybe you want to be. THE BAD GUY! Throughout the game you can find these little red orbs, or one big infinite red orb if you do something for someone. These red orbs allow you to invade other peoples world as a red phantom. As a red phantom, you must kill the host player in return for a few rewards. You don't even have to kill him yourself, actually, you can just have the world do it for you. Though be warned, because that can backfire through another of the games items I'll leave for your to discover. All these online features really work to enhance the general experience of the game. It makes the lonely journey not feel so lonely now that you know there are others on the same crusade as you are. It can also work as a motivator showing you that it's not as hard as you thought if others could do it. There are also these groups in the game you can join called Covenants, which work as a sort of guild system for the online community. Each Covenant has their own thing going on as well as their own goals.The world of Dan Souls 3 is fairly large and expansive in it's own way. While the world of Dark souls 1 was like a ball where everything is connected, the world of Dark Souls 3 is more like a branch, with a main road that breaks off into a plethora of curious locations. There's always this sense of wonder and treachery when you embark on a new quest through a dangerous area, something that the second game seemed to lack since none of the areas didn't seem all that connected. Like how the top of a windmill led straight to hell. Getting immersed into Dark Souls 3 almost makes you feel like a Witcher, if that makes sense. While you can just go through the game and reach the end, there is a lot of reward for exploring and finding secret areas and dungeons that you may have not had to visit during your journey. You learn about the world around you by paying attention and scrounging for lore through various NPCs and items you obtain along the way. The items and equipment you pick up each have a description ranging from just the use of the item itself to the origin and history of the character it may or may not be related to. They don't seem all that important, but sooner or later things begin to click and you start to understand the world around you a little bit more. The boss battles is where Dark Souls 3 really shines, some of them are lame, sure, but most of them feel like a climatic end or halfway point of your expedition into a dungeon or a cave or a castle or whatever. Bosses are fast, vicious, and hit hard, forcing you to think on your feet. They challenge your reflexes and decision making skills and you feel like a true hero when you manage to make a boss look like a fool by dodging all of their flashy and powerful attacks.BUTShould you play Don King Souls 3: Screwing Mike Tyson? It stands as a nice end to a series. As much as I would prefer if From was known for their games about robots dashing at one another aggressively, I can see how Dark Souls became their most venerated series. It's a game that I can see pulling people into the series and making them interested in the previous games in the series. Is it crushingly difficult as some people make it out to be? No, but it's challenging, it expects a certain amount of competency from the player and doesn't want to just hand things to you. Its kind of lame to see articles and videos floating about on the internet of people who's entire job revolves around playing video games wishing that the game had a easy mode just because they were unwilling to learn and adapt to the games mechanics. Which is why you should listen to me, Dirk.Dark Souls 3 is the kind of game that expects you to actually sit down and play the game, be engulfed in it's dark and foreboding world, learn and connect the pieces that make up it's lore. Is it the best RPG ever made? No, and if you didn't like the other games in the series, I doubt you'd like this one. But is it a fantastic game? Definitely. Dark Souls 3 gets 5 heavily armored camping trips out of 5 and the Dirk Dickbutt stolen Oscar award of approval.",1
Positive,"I quite enjoyed DARK SOULS III. Although the world is not as branching and connected as DARK SOULS I there are some areas that do have a similar flow to them, where one bonfire joins several paths together through the use of shortcuts. The gameplay is incredibly fast and fluid in comparison to the first two Dark Souls games, something that I was not prepared for during the early hours of the game. I loved the game so much I kept going until I had unlocked every achievement.I know some players took issue with the amount of throwbacks and references to the previous games with recurring characters, locations, and items from the previous two Dark Souls, even Demon's Souls, but I didn't mind at all. The original Dark Souls is the end of the beginning so by the time DARK SOULS III comes around there is an established ritualistic and recursive behaviour in regards to the fading flame. Just like in real life where the world is constantly changing, each civilisation's forgotten history falling victim to entropy, so has the world of DARK SOULS III.DARK SOULS III is difficult but far easier and simpler game to play than the original. Player movement is so fluid and the amount of invulnerability offered when dodge rolling is a huge boon to the player, it's hard not to view it as an exploit. I never bothered with PvP in the previous games but that changed here; after overcoming my nerves I found it incredibly addicting to the point where I'd stay up until 4am messing around as a Mad Phantom just to confuse the players I'd invade.While DARK SOULS III does have its issues in regards to broken mechanics - such as poise not working properly, hackers, and wonky collision systems - it manages to improve on the formula due to some necessary quality of life changes and technical optimisation. I consider DARK SOULS III to be a seriously amazing game, a satisfying closure to the series, and I hope never to see it revived.",1
Positive,This is definitely one of the hardest game i have ever played. But if u like to torture yourself than this game is for u.,1
Positive,very amasing :),1
Positive,"The PvE in this game is very good. If you're buying it for that (which I assume most people are), then it's definitely worthwhile. Similar in quality to (the first half of) Dark Souls 1, maybe even a bit better now that poise actually works. World layout isn't as good though.The PvP on the other hand.dear lord, it's the worst of the 3 Dark Souls games. By a lot. Flawed in a lot of very frustrating ways. And of course From has literally no idea how to balance weapons, so some weapons and weapon classes are just plain worthless. Nothing new there.",1
Positive,"What's a better way to celebrate beating this game than writing a review for it with adrenaline still rushing through my blood. Admittedly, being a hardcore long time Souls fan, I went into this game quite late as I've only recently acquired a gaming computer of my own. And Dark Souls 3 was an amazing journey that makes that wait worthwhile.My tale of coming across the Souls series was that of a happy accident. It was on an used Xbox 360 my parents bought for my 15th birthday that I discovered still locked achievements for a game called Dark Souls. And for reasons unknown, little me was drawn in immediately, perhaps by the icons for the achievements itself. So I set out immediately in search of this elusive RPG game that just came out a few years prior. Before I know it, I was hooked, dragged into a rabbit hole of bloody, exhilarating adventures; becoming a die (try) hard fan of the franchise. That also sparked my interest in extremely difficult games later on and subsequently a passion for roguelikes.Now at the end of a short trip down the memory lane, comes the actual review for the game itself. As most may know, the difficulty in Souls game have reached an almost legendary meme status where they'd be compared to a slightly hard game. And DS3 was no different, albeit the game in my opinion feels a less challenging than the first one. The game, however, made up for it in the way of clever enemies, maps and bosses' design. Most if not all of the bosses from the game have two phases to their fights, forcing the player to switch up tactics - a feature not common in previous titles. For example, my favourite boss fight is with the Dancer - avoiding any spoilers here - has the first phase consist of primarily clearly telegraphed attacks but as soon as the second phase rolls in, its attacks become much faster, much more dangerous to dodge nilly willy. As with other games made by From, lore and storytelling plays a very important role in their games. And this aspect is even stronger in DS3 with more lore hidden among item descriptions, even more NPCs with their individual quest lines to complete, all with their own very satisfying ending. And in my opinion, story elements in DS3 are strongest in all of From's games.Dark Souls are incomplete without amazing pieces masterfully crafted by various talent composers that literally breathed soul into these games - all the boss fights would feel extremely empty without these sounds in the background. The soundtrack of DS3 is no exception and I find myself listening to them from time to time to get a quick boost in morale.In short, Dark Souls 3 is an unforgettable experience is a definitely must have for all the Souls fan. Here's to more hours in this amazing franchise. P.S: if you're trying Souls game for the first time, I'd highly recommend the more clunky but amazing nonetheless first Dark Souls, preferably skipping the second game - the black sheep of the family, and finally finishing with Dark Souls 3, before moving onto Sekiro and Bloodborne.",1
Positive,Hey! Thats pretty good!,1
Positive,"Devs: How much swamp do you want in our game?Miyazaki: Yes""Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll meI ain't the sharpest tool in the shed.""8/10",1
Positive,"Dark Souls 3 is the supposed end of the series, and finds many amazing ways to wrap it up. I'll be doing my personal feelings on the game, at least rating wise, instead of looking at it like a critic. The very first thing I want to say, is that you can play the games in order of 1, 2, 3, but in my personal opinion, an order of 2, 1, 3, would be better for most players. Dark Souls 1 and 3 have many similar elements and are more closely tied together than 2 > 3. Now to get onto the ratings for this specific installment of the Souls series.Story: 9/10 - The story, like all of the other SoulsBorne games, are stories that aren't directly told, but more found by careful exploration and looking at every tiny detail the game offers. For people who want a more direct story telling, this can be frustrating at times, as you might find yourself thinking 'Why am I doing X or Y?' but for those who want to try to find the story based off of context clues and small details, it's perfect. Subtle details make the world feel more alive and connected, and make forming these own connections yourself that much more rewarding. If you find yourself wondering what the lore is behind something specific I might recommend looking it up on YouTube, as there are many wonderful people who cover the subject.Gameplay: 9/10 - The gameplay is similar to Dark Souls 1, instead of Dark Souls 2, which has its pros and cons. Pros - Quicker, sharper, with a bit of the realism taken away, which in a fantasy game is fine. Cons - PVP is a bit overwhelming at times, especially if you're new to the game, there will be people who have played the game for years now, and just do invasions to kill and trick brand new players. People say 'Easy Peasy, Lemon Squeezy', but in cases like this, if you're starting the Dark Souls series with this one, I'd like to say 'Difficult Difficult, Lemon Difficult'. There can also be times however where you find some of the funniest and friendliest people, randomly gesturing, helping you through levels, or dropping you end game items that you otherwise wouldn't get until the end of the game. Really anything happen. The SoulsBorne community is nothing if not random.Besides that, if you're the type of person, like me, who enjoys learning by mistakes, blood, sweat, and tears, it's definitely a good style for you, and the amount of reward you feel after defeating a boss you've been struggling with for hours/days is amazing.Customization: 8.5/10 - A large part of what I enjoy about Dark Souls 3 in particular, is the difference and variety in builds you can do for PVE. From an assassin using magic to make themselves quieter, to knights using faith to slam lightning into their enemies, to a bowman ducking and weaving between enemies to pelt them down, there's something for everyone's style of play. Some fit better at different times than others, and if you truly don't like your build you can respec once you reach a certain point in the game. Appearance wise you can also take the time to make your character appear however you want, but if you wear a helmet you won't be seeing your characters face much at all.Music: 10/10 - Maybe perhaps the best part of the entire SoulsBorne series, the music is near flawless and always beautiful. From the most melancholy piece, to the most epic, the music is something that tugs at the heartstrings in your soul and truly makes you feel for this dying world. Nothing bad to say about the music anywhere, other than I could use more and more.All around: 9/10 - This game is nearly perfect in many aspects for me, but falls short in a few others as well. The story is wrapped up very well (depending on which ending you go for), the combat is very finely tuned, and as you go through the game you feel the world struggling on-wards, attempting to live its last breath. The area where the game falls short is playing through after your first time, it feels much much shorter. It's VERY easy to miss certain NPC quest line. Certain ones can't even be completed without playing through the game multiple times, so if you're a completionist, be prepared to do multiple playthroughs. Final Thoughts: I highly recommend this game for anyone wanting to be engrossed in a decaying world, one that is difficult and gritty, but rewarding at the perfect times. Beauty abounds and difficulty astounds, but with time, perseverance, and a bit of luck, you'll find yourself enjoying one of the best games of the last decade.",1
Positive,It was my first souls game and I will be revisiting all the priors just because i would like to play more souls. It was a semi-rough journey with a learning curve since it was never a series I really got myself into. But Once I learned i thrived and honestly it is one of the most rewarding experiences you can ask for.,1

Positive,"I love this game more than I love first Dark Souls. This game is more fast peaced than previous two and even more challanging. But every time you hit a wall you will try and try to climb over it untill you succeed and feel sweet satisfaction of victory!Pros:- Great combat system- Great story- NPC side-quests force you to explore world even more (but are worth it)- Amazing soundtrack- World design (it's beautiful and clever)- Enemy and bosses design- Challanging, sometimes even hard, but not impossible- Jolly co-operation!- THERE IS NONE FUCKING BLIGHT TOWN!Cons:- You will get hit through walls- Enemies unlimited fp/stamina- Camera can and probably will screw you with 25 inch dilldo- Laggy PvP- PvP douchebagsTips?

Positive,"In my adventures to find games to play I stumbled upon Dark Souls 3 (DS3). Six years ago, I started playing the game with an old friend but put it down due to finding other games to play at the time. Well, for the past few weeks, I have been playing DS3 and I have to honestly say that I wish I played this game a lot sooner. I love everything that this game has to offer and the builds you can make in the game are amazing.ProsWonderfully crafted story in its world-building and item descriptionsChallenging gameplay that will make you think about your next moveOptional side quests that are actually fun Many different builds to use and try outBeautiful graphics that make the areas amazing and creepyConsSide quests either have specific or small windows when they are availableNow, I can t really talk about the story of DS3 simply due to the fact that it s not told directly to you. The story of the game is mostly interpreted by the community so you will have to take it from there. The remainder of the story is mostly found on item descriptions and its world-building, which is also not told to you directly but just by looking at it you can get a feel for the world. From the buildings you see to the enemies/bosses you fight, it s all unique in many ways and I love it.I am someone who loves Dark Fantasy stuff and DS3 doesn t necessarily need to have a story for me to fully watch. I loved how the world also has a bunch of influences on the Berserk series and I can even see some of the comparisons in the game.Now whichever Dark Souls game you play, they are all known for their gameplay being difficult in many ways, although it should, of course, be worth noting that difficulty is subjective to everyone. However, I will say that DS3 is a challenging game in its own right. There are tough enemies to deal with around the corner and challenging boss battles that you can go and beat. You are given some tools to help you deal with the bosses and if you have a friend who also plays the game, you can summon them to help you in the boss fight as well.After you kill an enemy or boss, you will be given Souls. These Souls will give you upgrades to stats. Strength will help you carry heavy weapons more easily - if you don t meet the proper strength, you won t swing the weapon properly. Dexterity also helps as it makes you carry more weight and if you don t meet the requirements for that, the weapon will bounce off enemies. Endurance will help increase stamina, which gives you the ability to do more actions like attacking, etc. Vigor will give your character more HP, which is good for survivability when fighting enemies or bosses.I could go on for more about the stats in this game but that is pretty much a whole review on its own for me to talk about. There are soft caps and hard caps for all the stats in the game so there will be a point at which you will get less than the usual level per stat you increase.There are also a few starting items you can get to help you at the beginning of your run. One thing I have to note is that no matter what item you start with, you can get everything else in the game. Including the item you start out with, whatever you get will only give you what you start out with. Unfortunately, though, there is no Master Key like in the first DS game. That s fine as you can travel pretty much to any bonfire at the start of the game.With that in mind, there are also a ton of different weapons, armor, and builds that you can use in the game. You will have to meet certain stat requirements to use some of the weapons or armor so sometimes you will have to farm for Souls. There is magic in the game but it s ok for the most part, you can use spells as you do have a magic meter, and doing a magic build is possible but it s an investment. You will need a high faith level to use some of the best spells and to do damage, thus making you a glass cannon of sorts.After defeating a boss, you will be awarded a Boss Soul. These special Souls can be used to acquire new weapons. Or you can use them to get extra Souls to get extra stats for you to level up, do note that if you do this you can t recover the Boss Soul unless you fight it again on New Game+.There are times when you have to go back to certain areas or explore the world in some way to progress through the story. While you may get stuck, you can explore the world or if you want to look up a guide, there is no shame in doing any of this as some of the info you get is vague.There are also some side quests and optional bosses that you can fight that can give you some nice rewards. They add things to do in the game and it s always nice to do other activities in DS3, the game offers quite a few things to do and explore and it s worth it to try the optional quests.Although I mentioned that some of the info that the game gives you is vague, well that also applies to the side quests as well. As they either have a specific or small window of them being open and if you progress in the game, you will be screwed over from doing it. You can beat one boss for you to only be locked out of a side quest because you did not speak to a certain NPC on the other side of the map. It s not the player's fault for this, it s just FromSoftware never gave you any hints or cues to do certain things.DS3 is a very beautiful game, the areas you visit look dark and depressing but have some sort of undead-life feel to them all. It makes you want to explore what lurks around every corner. NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 3GB, AMD Ryzen 5 1500X Quad-Core Processor 3.50, and 16 GB of RAM, I experienced no issues while I was playing and got a constant 60 FPS while playing.Dark Souls 3 is one of those games that I wished I picked up sooner to play and I am honestly glad that I finally found the chance to experience the game. I had a ton of fun playing it and this has encouraged me to try out the other games in the series. I even went and bought the DLC's which were a ton of fun to play and explore throughout. I highly recommend this game to fans of the Dark Souls series or to those that are wanting to start out with it. There is a ton of replay value to have, and the game even has multiplayer.Ahh, another one, roused from the sleep of death to review at Life Needs a Little Sin for good quality reviews",1
Positive,"First of all, the changes affected the design and elaboration of locations, which became much more interesting to explore in order to move forward. There were some lore additions directly related to what happened in the first part. The world has completely rotted and needs the beginning of a new era, which only those who are not worthy of becoming ashes can do. Ashen One (ash), called the Fire Keeper, is controlled by the player, forced to travel a long way to fight the Lords of Ash, returning them to their thrones in the Firelink Shrine. With these actions, Ashen One must end the Age of Fire and begin a new one, thereby putting an end to the curse of the undead.Dark Souls' lore has always been boss-based, so I'll highlight Aldrick, Devourer of Gods. Has an interesting backstory, character model and, in my opinion, attacks. Yes, they are borrowed from Gwyndolin the Dark Sun and other characters, which looks impressive in the compartment. Lothric, the younger prince and Lorian, the eldest prince also do not leave indifferent, leaving a taste of sadness at the end.Added storylines that are easy to miss because some actions are impossible to figure out. Concerns Henri from Astora, bringing a good ending. It follows that you need to be constantly vigilant so as not to miss small details that can seriously affect the outcome. Otherwise, if you carefully examine the locations, communicate with NPCs and read the descriptions of the loot, it will not cause any difficulties.The big problem with Dark Souls remains cheaters who enter the world like red phantoms. It is unpleasant to lose coal because of guests who are not capable of a fair duel. This would include pinging, which is additional pain in one place, since it is difficult to cause damage. This does not apply to players who create mini-bosses and provide a real opportunity to win. Overall, if you are in the right place at the right time, red phantoms are not a problem.There was only one major bug - a failure under the textures after the battle with Abbys Watchers. It was so surprising, and the pools of other people s blood confirmed that this was not an isolated incident.If the previous parts of the series did not work, then this one should be given a chance to prove itself. Must have by default. And I'm ready to marry her.",1

Positive,"Honestly, this might be my favorite From Software game. Sure, it doesn't have the pure innovation of Demon's Souls or Dark Souls, but it polishes both of those games and adds the better parts of Bloodborne to make a nearly perfect experience. DS and even DeS have some of my favorite levels, but DS3 puts it all together in a beautiful package. Once you start getting to the later parts of this game, you really feel like the devs went above and beyond in that way to make the best of all worlds type of game. I don't think anything will match my first moments in DeS, but this one sure has me hooked and the coop is really solid, making it a more friendly game in some respects.The graphics are the best From has put out period. After the horribly janky 30FPS of Bloodborne, damn this just feels right. Perfect image quality and 4K at 60FPS with a 1080ti or better. Turn DoF off for a nicer look with full detail. I could not ask for more in visuals department outside of clipping fixes.The story and lore is probably a tad redundant by now. I still have very little emotional connection to the hero, and I just don't buy the less is more theme anymore. From really needs to invest in some better storytelling. I don't want or need Witcher 3 type dialog scenes every 5 minutes, but I do want to to care about the characters in the game. They should take a page from Ghibli films to assert their conservative approach with a bit more heart. Outside of that, this is still a great package with decent bits here and there. Much better than Bloodborne for me.From has some quality characters in here, and the bosses are great fun, yet it just need a bit more detail and complexity to the characterization of those at hand. Places like Irithyll are just stunning and the best the series has ever looked, but this game goes beyond that in the DLC and in general most areas are about the best they can do at this time for the Dark Souls vibe. The connective environments are amazingly resonant, and looking at the castle as you move in and around it during the beginning is brilliantly done better than any other of their games. From has really crafted a spectacular world here full of great detail.I feel like you can critique some of the balance though. Too many rings are useless, and I really wish they would have tweaked that aspect to make the builds a little more varied. Certain swords seem to immediately assert dominance, but after you get to the middle there are a lot of options with weapons and spells. Overall, the usual complaints from a From game of course. I didn't find this one too hard at all. Plenty of bonfires and coop make it almost too easy in parts, but you can treat that part how you want to make your own difficulty. For me I didn't want to struggle too much so I did some cooping for once, and it was a blast all told. You definitely still need to be very careful in certain areas, so it's not like the game is giving you free passes. And at this point in time you won't get coop spawns all that much anyway, though, the community is still active to this day in late 2024.Both the DLCs add a lot to the base game and completes the package well. I have never been one for multiple playthroughs, but they offer plenty for Souls enthusiasts with DS3. I can't see how any Souls fan would not recommend this. The controls are back to amazing after the horrific controls the B team peddled in DS2. No more awful deadzones, no more weird acceleration curve. This one feels great to maneuver with in all respects. The atmosphere, sound, and visuals are overall From at the top of their game. It's definitely an homage to their entire work as a studio, but it stands tall as a great game in its own right.",1

Positive,"I have so many positive things to say about this game that I honestly don't know where to begin.I guess I'll start with the difficulty.The game is extremely difficult, I mean it's Dark Souls, I don't think anyone is surprised by that.If you're not familiar with Dark Souls games, all of them are very difficult but that's exactly the point and half the fun comes from overcoming the difficult challenges that the game presents to you.I'm a newcomer to the Dark Souls series, and this is the first souls game that I've played and finished.I liked it so much that by the end of the game, it became my favorite singleplayer game of all time.If you're not up for the challenge and do not like trying to learn boss patterns, I don't think this game will be your cup of tea.Even regular enemies are tough and some of them may make you want to scream and smash your controller against the wall.There is no tutorial, the game doesn't hold your hand at all, and you're pretty much on your own from the beginning.YOU have to figure out where to go, what to do, what items do, which weapon is the best for you, which armor to wear, which stats to level up, how to beat a boss, etc.I liked the UI in this game a lot, it's very simple and doesn't have a bunch of obnoxious UI elements that cover up half of your screen. It's small, useful, and simple, and the menu is really easy to navigate!Boss and level design are so far above average games, it's unreal.Every boss looks good and unique and has his own attack patterns.Every area in the game has its theme and is very fun to explore.It's very rewarding to get an upgrade or a new item from just exploring the world, everything has its purpose and a lot of things have interesting lore behind them.Unlike most other games, in Dark Souls, you have to work for it in order to get lore.You have to look for NPCs in areas of the game and talk to them to get bits and pieces of the lore, which later you have to put together in your head.If you want even more lore, you can read the descriptions of various items.The game uses environmental storytelling and doesn't just serve you everything on the plate.In terms of replayability, I'd say that it's worth replaying the game multiple times to get different endings and fight your favorite bosses a few more times.The game has a feature called NG+ which allows you to replay the game with the same character and not lose any items (except specific ones like keys) and keep your levels, spells, weapons, etc. There are a few optional areas and bosses in the game that you can easily miss if you're playing for the first time which is one more reason to replay the game.Gameplay is very fun.There is rolling and attacking, those will be 2 main things you're gonna use, of course, there is more to it like weapon arts, spells, parrying, blocking, and things like that, but I found myself using mainly roll and attack buttons, and I think that's how it is for the majority of players, especially new ones.There is a ton and I really mean A TON of different weapons that change how you play the game depending on which one you're using.On the one side, you have slow but hard-hitting weapons such as greatswords (which is my personal favorite), and on the other side, you have fast but lower-damage weapons like katanas and daggers.Don't let anyone tell you you're using a bad weapon or your build is bad because you can beat the game with any weapon if you practice enough, and if you're REALLY good you can also beat it on level 1, naked, and by using nothing but your fists.The graphics are pretty decent considering it's an almost 7 year old game, but that is not very important in my opinion and you should not expect much in that department.Dark Souls 3 runs well on older systems and you shouldn't have problems running it even on higher settings if you have even a somewhat competent PC.There is also PVP if you play in online mode, but I haven't tried it yet so I cannot comment on that.If you're really having trouble with some boss, you can summon a friend in co-op to help you out, but I wouldn't recommend it since beating a boss alone and all by yourself feels infinitely more rewarding, at least to me.There are only 2 cons about Dark Souls 3 in my opinion.1. Keyboard and mouse controls are awful, I strongly recommend not using them to play this game, a controller is pretty much a must-have if you want to have a good time!2. Camera. In some boss fights like 1st phase Nameless King, when he's riding that dragon you're fighting the camera more than you're fighting the boss.These cons are easily forgivable since there are so many good things about Dark Souls 3, and everything else about the game is epic!I have so much more things to say about the game, but this review is already too long, so to summarize:1. Extremely challenging game.2. No tutorial or hand-holding, you're on your own from the start.3. Very simple and minimalistic UI.4. Godly boss and level design.5. Fun exploring.6. Interesting story.7. Environmental storytelling.8. Good replayability.9. Enjoyable gameplay.10. Big variety of weapons and armor.11. Good optimization.Even almost 7 years after its release, Dark Souls 3 is still worth buying for the full price of 60 euros.The best singleplayer game I've played. 10/10",1

Positive,"Dark Souls 3 is a fantastic addition to the series that improves upon the previous formula very well. If you were to compare this to Dark Souls 1, it has better bosses, the same (epic) quality of music, incredibly fun weapons, and cool looking armor. The only thing I would say DS1 has over DS3 is a better world. If you're new to the series, DS3 is a fine place to start. It references the past 3 games but given that all of these games have implicit story, you're not going to feel lost or anything; you may just not recognize certain references/items from old games. As this is a souls game, it is of course very difficult. There are a few areas that admittedly feel a bit unfair, but most of the game's difficulty is a proper challenge where you know where you went wrong.

After revisiting this game having played Elden Ring (which I love), I was amazed to find how much of the latter's gameplay refinements have come directly from this game. If you like Elden Ring and are waiting for the DLC, do yourself a favor and play/replay this. If you have never played a FromSoft game, this is probably a very good introduction, although the story may be a bit obscure for new comers. The only downsides are some buggy achievements unlocking (never had this issue with other FromSoft titles) and the grinding required for some Covenant rewards, if you wish to play this offline.",1
Positive,Great game best game ive ever played. like ever. No fucking joke like i love getting fucking fisted by bosses that i should be killing first try. like fucking wolnonk or whatever cause dont you just love getting forced to the top of the boss arena then he spits his fucking gunky juice shit all over the area its amazing. It was this point in the game i realised that i didnt care if i beat him because i was summoned into my friends world and it meant more to him than me so instead i just caved my skull in and threw my pc out my window and finally i was in peace. like i could just die in peace go to heaven but realise heaven doesnt exist so i went back to the wolnir boss arena and i will forever get fisted by his gassy juice getting poured into my blood stream and poured into my fucking arsehole. at this point i realised i only had to break his stupid gucci bracelets made by fucking lil pump i then easily killed him and killed myself. best game 10/10 i just wish i could fight High lord wolnir for the rest of my puny existance on this god forsaken planet(I have like 600 hours on dark souls 3 and like 500 on dark souls 1 on console so this review is the most valid thing you will ever read about a game ever),1

Positive,"do not need to be discussed again, you must be ready to die quickly at the beginning of the game and even die many times. Don't be frustrated, just enjoy it (even though it's always emotional every time you play at the beginning and sometimes almost throwing the controller at the monitor), the point is always being patient in playing is enough to give the impression to always be patient in every moment",1
Positive,"Video Version:Dark Souls 3 is an excellent if almost somewhat nostalgic ending to the Souls series of games. My experience with it was a nearly perfect one from the perspective of performance and stability. I had no crashes and maintained a solid 60 frames per second throughout essentially the whole game. Controller support is functional right out of the box without needing to go to Durante for a fix and you just need something like DS4Windows to use a Dual Shock 4 controller.The weapon, monster and boss variety is great but the zone visual variety is a bit lacking when compared to the other souls games. Most zones are tied together nicely and the ones that aren t can be easily teleported to with short load times, at least on the PC version which is what I played.All in all, this is a game that is absolutely worth playing. It s worth buying at full price and is a must have in the game library if you enjoy 3rd person action games. It s also pretty damn good for working on your hand eye coordination. And with any luck, From Software will give us some great DLC content in between now and whatever their next dystopian psychologically horrific game happens to be.",1

Positive,"This is some of the most fun I ve had playing a video game. Dark Souls 3 is my favourite in the series. It feels like they took what they learned from all the previous games and made this game the most refined experience out of them all. It feels streamlined but in a good way, it s missing the interconnected feeling from Dark Souls 1 where every area connects with each other which I kind of miss but on the other hand I wasn t getting stuck as to where I needed to go next every few hours like I did in Dark Souls 1. In Dark Souls 3 you always know your path ahead and it s a good feeling and you can feel the the progression you are making which is nice. It s the most atmospheric souls game too, it does a great job immersing you in its amazingly crafted environments. The level design is terrific, a lot of awesome and memorable areas and much less frustrating and annoying ones like the crystal cave in Dark Souls 1 or the shrine of amana in Dark Souls 2, there is nothing close on that level of annoyance in Dark Souls 3. The combat and movement is the best it s ever been, I like how its more fast paced which you can tell they ve taken from Bloodborne and it s a welcome addition. It was by far the easiest game in the series but I think that s mainly because I have a lot of experience from the franchise rather than the game itself being easy because I can see some areas and boss fights being really difficult for newcomers in particular. I think this game is a masterpiece in design and execution. 10/10 (Masterpiece)",1
Positive,"Compared to the first Dark Souls game, DS3 is ""young and good-looking"" with a slightly shallow background story, so well-prepared veterans may find this sequel more like an adventure game instead of a souls game. But any wording saying this game is not a masterpiece is a lie. Dark Souls III is hard than Dark Souls II, but much easier than the original Dark Souls game. Unlike the original game's connecting-as-a-whole map, some of DS3's maps are separated and only teleport can access, with Firelink shrine being the most typic one. That's a disappointment, since the surprise of opening a door to find a super shortcut is gone. However, I believe that the Dev. put all their efforts in designing bosses and builidngs. Irithyll (still don't get its pronounciation) and Anor Londo are straightly perfect. Sometimes I even feel that the city has the ability to grab my soul, then throw it into an oil painting. Well when my friend was playing this game for the first time, on the stairs between Dancer and Vordt, I told him, ""Do you wanna feel Dark Souls ? Then turn left and kill the man sitting on a chair. You'll see."" No doubt he was ripped by Dancer, but he then knew what makes a pretty boss fight. Being the last game of the series, Dark Souls III answered lots of questions and also suggested us endings of some NPCs, no matter you are wondering or not. One is the laddersmith being dead in profond city, right next to the bonfire, who also appeared in Dark Souls II. This story tells us, 15,000 souls for a ladder is too much. Greed will cost your life. Also, is Gywnevere (or Gywndolin) related to Aldrich ? Is Andre related to Gywn ? The fire keeper, is she really blind (even after you gave her the eyes) ? Why is Patches ""Unbreakable"" ? I was super into lores of DS for a while and some of those questions really bothered me. There are Youtube channels making videos stating their own opinions. Check them ! The pros+Bosses are more agile and harder (My circus needs a dancer. Anybody ? )+ Lots of endings (Yes and for achievements you have to proceed to NG++)+ Best DLC of the series + Beautiful weapons and magics + Princesses are always gay (?)The cons- Battle mechanism stays the same, especially for mages. - Too many bonfires (lowers the difficulty)- Dislikable blue bar -Where's my Dark Souls III The Fire Fades Edition ?

Positive,"In 2011, my journey began. And in 2017, that journey ended. The original Dark Souls (2011) kindled a relationship with a video game that I had never experienced before. That relationship is stronger than ever, having morphed and strengthened over time across the series three iterations. The first game caught my attention, enthralling me in an imaginary universe I had never experienced before, but also tested my metal. The second game continued on the first game s strengths, but never captivated me like DS1. And now we have the third.In all honesty, I had my reservations about the latest, and final Souls game. Before the game s release I felt that From Software, the developer of the Soulbourne series, had exhausted their creativity and originality with the first and second games, and thus the third would end up a mere imitation of the series previous outings. But alas, my cynicism was proven wrong. Spoilers aside, this third outing in the series sees players take control of the Ashen One , a being tasked with bringing a bunch of Lords of Cinder to task, thus ending, or beginning anew, the age of fire a daunting task, as in DS1 & DS2, you yourself became a Lord of Cinder at each game s conclusion. The game functions and plays exactly as the previous two games. If the formula aint broke, then no point trying to fix it! Over +-35 hours you will explore a wide array of environments, defeat enemies, collect souls, consume said souls, and kit out your character with increasingly more powerful items, outfits and weapons, so that you can go and explore more dangerous locales, defeat even bigger enemies and consume more plentiful souls. This formula is repetitive, but maintains the player s attention through continuously presenting him/her with increasingly more challenging encounters that require skill, learning, knowledge and, for me at least, pure dumb luck.For some, the Souls games may prove difficult, but I believe the better term is challenging . Once you have learned the ins and outs of the game s combat and rpg mechanics you should be good to go. Of the three souls games DS3 does a good job of presenting the player with challenging encounters that never enter the realm of feeling impossible. The only boss that disproves this is Midir, an optional DLC encounter who functions much like other bosses, but has a ridiculous amount of health that can take what feels like eons to whittle down. Moreover, the challenges the bosses present are, arguably, made easier by offering the player options to summon npc characters to help fight most of the games many bosses. On the other hand, your journey is complicated by numerous invasions, whereby npc characters will invade your world and try their damndest to end your life. However, the AI of these invaders leaves a lot to be desired. Most can be easily defeated by stepping backwards after the invader attacks, then darting back in to deliver some damage; rinse and repeat and you ll destroy any invader. Overall, the choreographed invasions are pretty poor in comparison to what would occur in previous Souls games. Boss fights are the highlight of this game, and they rise to the high expectations set by both DS1 and DS2. DS3 provides a plethora of diverse bosses that range from humanoid warriors to hulking behemoth tree-giants. Each have their own style and atmosphere that never come too close to seeming akin to each other. A major boon for DS3 is that every boss has at least two different phases which force players to often alter their strategy mid-fight in order to compensate for a new phase of attacks or even environment. However, DS3 is quite conservative with regards to the kind of bosses it presents to the player. DS3 does not provide anything close to the alien and strange creatures that can be found in DS1 or Bloodborne; rather most bosses stick to having a humanoid form whilst wielding a large sword- or club-like weapon.To fight these big badass bosses, one needs good equipment. DS3 does a great job at providing a magnificent array of armor sets, weapons and spells. Importantly, the game plays on the nostalgia factor by providing items from past souls games. At one point I was able to kit out my character almost exactly as once done in DS1, as well as DS2. One complaint that I do have with regards to weapons is that the game has a tendency to force the straight and great sword options on the player due to them being so common, prevalent and effective. Both DLCs added much variety to the weapons arsenal, as well as special attacks that can be quite mesmerizing on first sight. Moreover, if arcane warfare is your thing, then DS3 has it covered. Faith, pyromancy and mage builds are supported by a multitude of spells for each school of magic, and are devastating in both PvE and PvP. An integral component of the Souls games is exploration. The DS3 adventure occurs across many well designed environments, each having their very own particular atmosphere and context-specific encounters. From dark dungeons to sky-high castles, putrefying swamps to forgotten caverns, the games does a great job at proving a wide array of areas to explore. Apart from the challenging enemy encounters, the player will interact with several npc characters, some of which will help you out, while others will attempt to hinder your progress. These npc s are far more expressive than those in previous Souls iterations, with many doing more than just standing around looking glum as in past Souls games. Some of these encounters reveal lengthy questlines, that once completed, have major influence on the overall main story line as well as on a variety of events. This is a welcome advent to the Souls series.Leading from this, we have the lore of the game. Like previous Souls games, little of the game s overarching narrative is told through direct story telling methods. Rather, the bulk of interesting and enigmatic lore and story comes from item descriptions and thorough inspection and observations within the game world. By just paying extra attention to one s surroundings, major plot points and supporting content can be uncovered. For those gamers that prefer story flung into their faces through lengthy cut scenes and detailed in-game codex s, be aware! DS3, as well as all other Souls games, takes a more active rather than passive approach to storytelling.With regards to presentation, DS3 is a beautiful game that successfully brings life to a dark fantasy world. Characters models are well designed and textures are good enough to seem realistic. However, some areas lack the intricate details afforded to others, making for an uneven experience from region to region. Adding to the aesthetic of the game, is the music and sound. DS3 sticks much to what has been done in past Souls games. Adventuring across the game s world is mostly done in absence of any music score. This and the environmental noise and sound do well to capture the feelings of isolation, loss and entropy. Once a major encounter begins then only does the typical Souls score commence.Overall, Dark Souls 3 is a fantastic entry and end to the Souls series. It may not experiment or adjust the Souls formula as much as some may have hoped for, but it does present a daunting adventure that will challenge anyone willing to take the chance. Personally, I find Dark Souls 3 to be a great Souls game; not quite as good as its older brother Dark Souls 1, or even its demented cousin Bloodborne. But it is a damn fine game in its own right.Score: 9/10",1

Positive,"I was initially skeptical as Dark Souls III seemed too easy and linear compared to the first and the second part. Also, I was not too fond of the fact that there's now a lot more fast-paced action instead of slower, methodical, and more tactical combat. Fortunately, I quickly got humbled by my cocky attitude and I found the challenge I was looking for.The game is slightly different from its previous parts, just like DS2 was different from DS1. It's indeed faster and more linear, maybe even more casual, but it doesn't affect the fun that DS3 generously provides. There are quite a few challenging and memorable bosses, the same goes for the areas you visit. I'm not the best at From Software's side quests and I think I haven't finished a single one in this part, but they're definitely there as well.While this is probably my least favorite Souls title from the original trilogy, it's still one of the best games I have ever played.",1
Positive,"Awesome game, probably the best out of the Souls series but. I wouldn't recommend it. Atleast not right now. For you see, the devs went overzealous with their anti-cheat system, so much that it bans legit players for no reason. Of course some might think that it is a small price to pay for getting rid of cheaters and hackers, right?WRONG!This does nothing. In fact players have been using hacked weapons to softban legitimate players by giving them more souls than they should have, thus the anti-cheat system labeling them as cheating. All it took was a few slashes and poof, you're banned. Hard to believe, right? Well, go ahead and google it and see for yourself. The one responsible even streamed the whole thing for a couple of hours, soft banning lots of innocent players. Also, lets not mention the other dozen of possible reasons why you might get banned, such as: crashing due to the game's lightning effect bug, going offline advancing in the story and coming back online only for the game to think that you cheated and got more soules than you had before going offline, using a controller program so you can use your favorite controller, just to name a few from the stop of my head.So yes, as awesome as the game is. don't buy it. Not yet, not until the devs fix the shitty anti-cheat system they made and start unbanning all the legitimate players.EDITED: 5/8/2016I felt like I should correct one of my mistakes, in my anger I failed to explain properly that getting softbanned by a hacker isn't instant and for that I apologies for the misinformation. When you get hit by the hacked weapon you can get rid of the surplus souls by suiciding twice which seems to work and might give some measure of relief for those that might fall victim to such people.Even so I can't and won't recommend the game, not until they fix this.EDITED: 30/9/2016Right, now that they solved some of the issues and unbanned players that didn't deserve it I can actually recommend the game.",1
Positive,"If u had played previous dark souls ( especially 1/remastered) : Get the game. It serves as a proper closure to the series and still delivers what makes this series so great . Just go and get it , you will love it . If u haven't play any soulsborne game : Highly recommend you to play Dark souls 1 / Remastered first , if else you will miss certain references and callbacks to previous lore and locations. I know dark souls games have a bad rep for being overly difficult . That was the factor that turned me away from this series . However when i gave it a try , I think the difficulty is perfectly fine. The game is challenging , without a doubt , but it is designed as such to create a sense of tension. It is similar to how combats in real life usually turns out : a bad decision in a split second / hesitate and distracted in combat would cause death. ( That being said , the game gives you 2 or 3 chances to act for your survival , ""One Hit Kill"" usually does not happen. )The adrenaline rush and the amount of sheer FOCUS you experience throughout the boss fights is one of the two best things this game offers. This game heavily relies of quick decision making and reflex, If you spend too much time lost in the thoughts of your tactics or worrying about the consequences of losing the duel , you already lost the fight. The second best thing this game offers is the sense of accomplishment that none other game could provide. That is the main appeal of SoulsBorne game , in my opinion. Never had I jumped out of my chair yelling "" I WON "" and hyperventilate due to adrenaline even the battle has already settled for 15 minutes , Not until I played this Dark Souls 1 and this game , Dark Souls 3 .tl;dr : If you like fighting big dudes and overcoming all odds to achieve victory If you like the thrill of combat where your actions could result in a victory or defeat in the matter of seconds If you like epic orchestral music and chants cheering you on when you face off against your enemies Buy This Game .",1

Positive,"Coming back to Dark Souls 3 after hundreds of hours in Elden Ring has been quite an experience. Originally I played about 65 hours worth of Dark Souls 3 before I dropped it for other things. It was my introduction into the Souls-like genre and it left a decent impression on me, but for one reason or another, I never gave it a second thought. 5 playthroughs of Elden Ring and at least 2 playthroughs of the Shadow of the Erdtree DLC later left me craving something similar, thus we return.Dark Souls 3 represents a key point of growth in the FromSoft catalog, in which we see a much more refined product than its 2 predecessors. That said, it suffers from caveats that FromSoft polished even further for the release of Elden Ring, but I don't believe this lack of polish is a bad thing. If anything it offers a different challenge from Elden Ring. I believe Dark Souls 3 deserves to be played and judged on its own merits because it has been a good experience thus far. 4/5 starsMay the Flames guide thee, Ashen One.",1
Positive,"at first i thought it was just some hard game set in a boring world, even the graphics didn't seem so appealing back then and i really started to feel regret buying itBut i decided i should give it a fair shot & after playing it for a little bit longer and right after i passed the first few little areas i started to feel some weird attraction to the game in a magical way, and the way i looked at it started changing for the better it was almost like ascending a staircase, a bit hard but really satisfying with every stepthe gameplay feels so smooth & variated, thanks to the ability to use magic & the wide variety of weapons selection making it even more fun and engagingand i also love the way items and secrets are scattered around the map, since it makes you so eager to explore every little corner of the map looking for them, especially since it's filled with all sorts of cool stuff & secrets and even some cool hidden bosses making it impossible for you to ever get bored with the gameand i must say bosses really impressed me here, they are so well crafted and programed, and even though they're so hard to beat, fighting them (and beating them) is fun as hell & really rewarding and satisfyingand what seemes like poor graphics at first turned into some breathtaking scenery later in the game, almost as if they are not from the same game you was playing at the beginning, trully remarcable!also the story & the lore are so interesting, and you also get 4 different endings for iti finished this game 5 times already and it was fun & enjoyable every signle one of them, almost as if i'm playing it for the first time, and i'm still looking forward to play it and finish it even more timesi don't think i'll ever get bored of it because for me at least this game has became the best game i have ever had the pleasure to try in my life 9,8/10",1

Positive,"Dark Soul 1 was gifted by a friend and when we start playing that I already enjoyed it so much, sadly the multiplayer summon option wasnt working that well back than.Ive never seen Dark Souls 2 so far, but probably will soon, and, went on with Dark Souls 3, the game is pretty, a lot of fun and the multiplayer is working better as ever! Good job on that one, the MP is so much more enjoyable.The only thing I do not really like is the level capping since the game has a build in difficulty system for when you go NG+ or higher so it would be pretty do-able to change difficulties when summoning verry high leveled players, but this could be an endless discussion caus there are always down and up sides.I also saw some environments and models back from DS1, which was a nice feeling back to thoose days but I did expect more new models/bosses to be around but I aint complaining at all.The game doesnt feel that long either but this can be on the fact that I summon a lot of friends, progress goes way faster that way.Currently I am in NG+ almost at the end and I will replay it again on NG++, that should say enough on how much I like this game :-)I do recommend it for others to buy aswell and enjoy this game!Be aware if you loose a couple times from a boss, it can become annoying or irritating, taking a break is that best thing I could recommend and try again another time. Eventually you will beat him!Also playing with friends makes the game way more fun and interesting compared as playing alone.Thats all, thanks!",1

Positive,"Finally, after 110 hours, I have completed my first souls game, taking all the time in the world to truly immerse myself in the world of Dark Souls. This game has done something for me that barely any other game has been capable of doing: making me feel genuinely powerful emotions. This is a game about life and death. If you, like me back in April 2016 on my Xbox, had never played a Souls game before, you'll learn very quickly that death is a frequent occurance. But this game is still fair . Something that Hidetaka Miyazaki (genius who was the director of DS1 and DS3) said in an interview that has stuck with me is that he doesn't see the game as difficult, but moreso challenging. This way of thinking really changed the way I see games no, and now it's hard for me to go back to other games because of the challenge and sense of accomplishment gained from overcoming a challenge in this game. And that's where the the emotions come into the picture. The intense feelings that I have gotten while fighting (Boss spoilers) the Nameless King is something I haven't felt in a boss fight or a fight in any game really. I died so repeatedly while fighting this boss and when I finally slew the bane of mine and many other player's existances [spoilers] (completely optional boss too) [/spoiler] I realized that my hands were shaking, my breaths were fast and shallow, and I was sweating. That 7+ minutes fight made me truly appreciate how amazing this game is. Around this point, which is very late game, is when I really got into the lore of the game, buying Dark Souls 2: SOTFS, and I'm going to pick up the remaster of the original for more stability than the original. This game got me into now one of my favourite series in gaming, as I'm a sucker for good stories and depp lore, this game's world really enthralled me. All in all, this has been such an incredible journey for me, about 2 years down the line, from console to PC to a new Chosen Ash. This game will always have a special place in my heart, and I hope it can do the same for you. This game is so deep and complex it can make some of the most incredible things happen, things that you will remember for years. The way the combat is weighty and slow but still fast-paced and exhilarating is the perfect way to make thrilling gameplay that always has you on the edge of your seat, deciding whether to press on and risk death or to head back to the bonfire to spend your hard-earned souls. This game is phenomenal, and something that I believe is a masterpiece of indirect storytelling, RPG mechanics akin to D&D, and gameplay that makes you feel like you truly accomplished something meaningful. I would recommend this game and the DLC (get them together though, they work so much better together than separate) any day, at full price. This game is amazing.",1

I don't think anything could really measure up to how beautiful this game looks. The gameplay, specifically the combat is genius. it just feels right. Every animation is fluid in 60 fps. Trust me, there isn't much to compare to the feeling of beating this game. IMHO this is one of the greatest games ever made.",1
Positive,I don't even know where to begin with this game. Its AMAZING. Everything is so polished and seamless. I've played this games 6 times over by myself and with friends. It has Skyrim replayability and the online works really well. I cant even explain how much I love it. 10000000000000/10,1

Positive,"nearly as good as dark souls 1 and absolutely the best bosses in the souls series and its not even close, sully and dancer are immaculate, abyss watchers are an absolute blast, irythill is the most gorgeous zone from has ever made and the gameplay is snappy and flashy. got banned because I used a boss rush mod but it was totally worth it",1
Positive,Is this game worth it? yes! Is this game worth it without multiplayer enabled? Some say yes some say no. I would say it is but I highly enjoy multiplayer and the fact that the servers have been offline for what 5 months now? for an RCE exploit that a modder fixed within a couple days and servers are still not back is inexcusable at this point and I feel obligated to give them a negative review. Bring back all the souls games Jolly Cooperation the fix is out just implement it already.Edit*** still not happy with how long it took to restore online services but they have been restored so back to thumbs up,1
Positive,"I don't usually write reviews because most people couldn't even bother to read them. Despite this, I would say that this is an amazing game that is surprisingly dead for how good it is. The soundtrack is beautiful, each enemy has its own moveset, strengths, and weaknesses. Bosses are even harder versions of the enemies but don't let the bosses fool you, the normal enemies are just as tough. I've died more to enemies before the boss than the bosses themselves. I've beaten this game about 20 times now with a new build each time. That should give you some insight on the replayability. When it comes to mulitplayer it boils down to two things, you either get ganked the moment you spawn in by three players, or you ""git gud"" and kill them. Usually you don't get a straight up 1v1 fight, when you do it is glorious, but most of the time you are getting ganked. The reason behind this is the game has a dedicated community, but isn't really growing. Dark Souls multiplayer is great, in my opinion, being able to fight alongside or against randoms is awesome but yet there is only around 7-10k people playing this game on the WEEKENDS. This is a game that came out 2 years ago? So often during invasions you will have to wait 5-10 mins for a fight only to get ganked. Its a vicious cycle. Graphically its beautiful, simple, not top of the line graphics but good enough to make you appreciate it. The weapons and armor designs are beautiful and mostly practical with a few whacky armor and weapons for those who like ridiculous proportions. Lookin at you STR builds >_> All and all, buy, play, git gud. Dark Souls is intimidating for some but trust me, by your 2nd-3rd playthrough you will be beating the bosses in your sleep. 10/10 game.",1
Positive,"(English)Well, I can only say this game it's a masterpiece, the bad thing about DS3, poise it's a pointless thing (weapons with perseverance for a tank it's more useful than a armor itself) and many areas of the game are locked so you have a linear progression ""sort of"" DS1 & DS2 you can take some different paths to progress.The PVE of this game it's the best, IA/hitbox are really well made, although it's more fast paced.The PVP well the PVP can be ""JOLLY GOOD"" or can be a ""Pa!n in hole"", I myself feel disgust to gank ""squats"" specially it's very common to the host quit with ""alt+f4"" when they die, still when u put your summon in Pontiff Sullyvah Arena, i met some really nice bunch of gladiators, so rejoice! Obs: i don't blame host when it's a invasion with invader/s who run around mobs instead of fight (this too it's shameful).Music of the game are amazing! I really love Soul of Cinder/Introduction theme /Vordt/Abyss Watchers songs it's superb!Weapons/spell balance, arguibly u can beat the game at SL1 using a broadsword without tempering it.Still after you try some weapons out most of the mainstream/good weapons. Have a similar pattern of attack and this can become a monotonous thing, one good way to avoid this it's making a Mundane build or creating another character(playing another game too). Nevertheless the're some useless thing in the game and you only need to search for them to get achievements.Worth it? Definetely yes.

Positive,Best in the Souls series.,1
Positive,"I just played this game because of research purpose, I never play any souls-like genre anymore after PS2-era but I have experience in some hardcore action games and I think I'll like and able to beat this game.But, after playing for 3-4 days, I found that I am not the ""target player"" because it makes me so tired. I like to do an exploration in many games, but here, it is very punishing, even more than the boss fights, especially when you dropped much souls in the middle of your journey.I tried playing it again until I managed to kill several bosses, because I still like the storyline, and ""research purpose"" of course. Then, the more I tried it, the more curious I became, I also thought that I had learned about how to beat this game and it turned out to be fun for me, like a rhythm games that I really love. I got the intention of this game that sometimes you have to lose because you need to know the enemy patterns more, while you still feel the enemy is beatable if you try more.What I also like here is there are lots of interesting hidden things, when you find them you will be even more interested. The lore itself is told indirectly which is cool for me. The consequences of your actions are also something I've never encountered in other games, like you can lose NPCs and their features for the entire session if you like, to kill them for example, or not do something before.I want to play previous Dark Souls series to know the whole story but I'm afraid that I won't be able to enjoy the controls, based on my friend's story and it's a very old game. Maybe I'll try Elden Ring next (which I think is also good for my next research), whose controls (or perhaps difficulty level) have been ""made easier"" from this DS3 and also makes me more confident that I can beat it easily compared to DS3. XD",1
Positive,"From what I've played so far (3 hours in), this game is looking to be pretty amazing. It's Dark Souls, for sure. It seems to take the best of each game and then combine them into one super-game. I love it, personally.

Great game with a lot of variety. Must have for tryhards!I would Praise the Sun till the fire fades ! 10/10,1
Positive,"Personally, Dark Souls 3 has the best story and second best level design in the series after the original one. The game really doubles down on weapon and armor variety that leaves you satisfied. Anyone can find a playstyle that suits them better. Compact level design pushes players into various events in each area that needs you to carefully dissect otherwise seemingly impossible challenges. Gameplay revolves around more dodging and favors offensive playstyle as enemies are much more aggressive and fast compared to previous titles. The base game is well crafted and executed but I can't say the same for the DLCs. DLCs feel like they don't want you to engage in the combat and just run through everything. The game encourages you to react strategically and use your brain but DLC pushes you so much that after dying in some areas, you don't want to kill those 40 enemies that take 15 mins to go through again. They clearly went overboard here. It was fun for me to kill em all in the first run and then I sprinted past them. So be wary about this.But the good part about the DLC is that the bosses are particularly well done and does the game favor greatly. Extremely hard bosses that requires strict management and knowledge of the game's mechanics that makes you fully use everything to get past. Almost every major encounter in the DLCs are memorable, so at the end, downsides are forgivable.Possibly the best pvp mechanics of the series here. Multiple factions attacking and defending each other, it's total chaos that always ends up as an exhilarating experience through and through. Absolutely brilliant soundtrack as icing on the cake. Definitely recommended and a must play of the souls genre.",1
Positive,"DS3 is definitely the toughest among the 3 in the series. Devs took the best parts from DS1 and DS2 and merged them in DS3. The normal enemies are quite tough but on the contrary most bosses are easy. A lot of things from DS1 are mentioned here and that makes the journey quite reminiscing. This makes DS3 a true successor of Dark Souls 1. The created world is beautiful and at the same time full of evil.Loved both the DLCs. The transition of difficulty from the base game to the DLCs are very much noticeable. Ringed City is the hardest as well as the most entertaining part in the entire game. Kept getting squashed by Midir and Gael again and again until cooking up some strategies and having some luck.The graphics, tone of the world, and music are top class. Also the occasional ambushes are enjoyable. Loved every moment of this game as I completed it thrice :)",1
Positive,"Live. Die. Repeat. Curse some, but never stop playing.I finished this game on PS4 and I got it as a gift (fitting, I must say) on steam. Superb gameplay, which borrows some of its characteristics from Bloodborne.However, be mindful of its multiplayer. After Elden Ring launched earlier this year, the servers suffered. Also, steam removed multiplayer as its characteristics, and online play is not available, which is a bummer, while also being very important in a souls game.With that setback in mind, I must say that Dark Souls III is a superb game. But if you want to play multiplayer, maybe now is not the time for that.",1

Positive,"I get it now.I see why people love this series. Life is a journey, not a destination.",1
Positive,One of the greatest games i ever played. It is the best Dark Souls game ever. A really good finale to the series. It's got some of the most immersive and graphically impressive enviroments. The art design and sound are top notch. Enemy & the bosses variety is well done. Masterpiece,1
Positive,"I didn t finish Dark Souls 2 because of the weird controls and no support for controller remapping (a big deal for me). So, I jumped straight from Dark Souls 1 to 3, and found Dark Souls 3 to be a major step up from an already solid game.The level design in Dark Souls 3 is much more refined compared to Dark Souls 1, where some areas felt utterly unfair. While the map is more linear in Dark Souls 3, it still offers great interconnectivity without being overly complicated. This makes exploration and navigation a lot more enjoyable. More importantly, though the map is not as sophisticated as Dark Souls 1, it gives players a clearer idea of where to start, helping them avoid accidentally stumbling into high-difficulty areas. Plus, the boss arenas are closer to bonfires, so no more long, annoying runs back after dying.I wasn t a fan of the final boss in the first DLC - I found the second phase unnecessary and a bit messy. However, Dark Souls 3 features very solid boss design, even surpassing Elden Ring in overall quality. While Dark Souls 1 undeniably has the best opening of any From Software game, I really enjoy the lore in Dark Souls 3, which expands the world and has tons of callbacks to the first game. These references either continue or conclude some of the original lore, making it my favorite part of the game.In my opinion, Dark Souls 3 is nearly perfect, but the ridiculous enemy spam in the DLCs can ruin the experience. In DLC 1, it feels like the developer forgot about balance and just crammed enemies into every corner. DLC 2 is slightly better, but the enemy encounters from the Ringed Inner Wall to the next bonfire are frustrating and over the top. The camera tracking can also get messy and disorienting at times, and the short lock-on range can often disappear mid-fight, leading to serious frustration.And why the hell doesn t this game have cloud save?Despite those issues, Dark Souls 3 is a must-play for anyone interested in the genre, blending challenging yet fair gameplay, refined level and map design, and captivating lore. It is the textbook example of a souls-like game, where the core features of the genre come into their own.",1
Positive,"Allright, this game is great. The world might not be as good and interconnected as DS1, but that's one of the only gripes I have about this game.The combat is way better with more options, more tension, and way better balanced than the older games. It just works more as intended which feels amazing.The levels are really well designed with shortcuts and good enemy placementsThe areas look cool and have good enemy varietyThe bosses are amazing to fight with a few exceptions, like the wyvernsThe music is the best in the series, imoI will talk about the dlc on its own:Ashes of ariandel:I love this dlc, it might just be a single area, it is a damn good one. The enemies are cool, it tells a real story, it looks great.I love the end boss too, very cool fight even with how hard it is. Truely amazing dlc. Some people say it's too short, but I'd say it's worth it.Ringed City:I feel a bit more mixed about this dlc, While I really like the new enemies, the lore, the areas and the bosses, all amazingI had some problems with some of the enemy placements, where it felt like they just threw a whole bunch of strong/annoying enemies in one place, fuck you deal with it. This is the only problem I have with it however, so if you can deal with a tiny bit of that, this dlc is still amazing.",1
Positive,"I bought this game with all its DLCs for about 5 Dollar (approximately 3 years ago). It was a great misfortune for my first close combat game to start with the Dark Souls series because when I first started the game, I couldn't really muster the patience. One day, at the insistence of a friend, I tried installing the Cinders mod, which makes the game a bit easier, and I played the game for about 5 hours in one sitting. The game had started to addict me. I quickly finished the game with Cinders; I deleted the mod and started playing vanilla. The game had started to draw me in more; both in terms of story and gameplay. I finished the game once, it wasn't enough, I finished it a second time, it still wasn't enough, and so on. I finished the game with vanilla version 4 times playing with Cinders once, and it still wasn't enough. Right now, I'm playing the Convergence mod. This review will be for the Vanilla version.As you all know, the Dark Souls series is a straightforward melee combat game, in other words, a pure fighting game. What was present in the previous games holds true for Dark Souls 3 as well, but there are some changes in certain aspects. 1- The most noticeable point while playing is that the Estus drinking animation is shorter compared to Dark Souls 2, and we can move while doing it. 2- The roll mechanic works much smoother than Dark Souls 2, and the hitboxes are much more precise. 3- I don't know if I need to mention this, but the visual effects of the bosses are truly amazing. 4- The gameplay of bosses like Soul of Cinder, Pontiff Sulyvahn, Sister Friede, Abyss Watchers, and many others is truly beyond amazing and provides incredible satisfaction. 5- The feeling of landing hits is much better than Dark Souls 2. (You don't feel like you're hitting a boss with butter anymore.) 1- As everyone would agree, not being able to use some boss weapons or mimic their moves. 2- Farron Keep (I don't need to say anything else, those who have played it understand what I mean, and those who will play it will understand when they get here.) 3- Playing as a sorcerer in this game is a real struggle.The Dark Souls series focuses on three main themes:-What fire is, as in ""Dark Souls 1""-Hollows, as in ""Dark Souls 2""-The fading of fire, as in ""Dark Souls 3""This game revolves around the fading of fire, and it accomplishes this exceptionally well. It's a classic move by our brother Miyazaki; he tells stories in an understated manner. It's easy to do that, but it's hard to engage the audience and stoke their curiosity to this extent. Normally, I would never finish a story-driven game five times or even attempt a sixth, but this game arouses so much curiosity in you that you find yourself thinking, ""What if I play like this?/How fast can I finish it with this build?/I think I missed something, let me check again/The fight with this boss was so amazing."" Just like me, it captivates many of my friends, and if you've played and finished this game with enthusiasm, it captivated you too, my friend. There's no point in empty fanboying here; the game is genuinely great. Although some parts - especially the dogs - are extremely frustrating, the game somehow manages to keep you glued to the screen.On the other hand, the game is moddable. The mods created by modders allow you to experience this game. Now you might say, ""But you're basing this review on mods too."" I'm not talking about how great the mods are, otherwise I'd go and write this under the mods made by those modders. What I mean is that the depth and beauty of the themes, NPC designs, level designs, story, bosses, and many other possibilities provided by mods make them deeper and more beautifully themed.This review covers both modding and the general aspects of the game. I compared it to previous games in some aspects, and you can clearly see the huge improvements. The game's dark theme, its exceptional depiction of the final leg of the Dark Souls story adventure, unique boss battles, fantastic/smooth gameplay, the ability to instill such a deep sense of curiosity, and the extensive and beautiful modding possibilities. In my opinion, this game deserves a 9 out of 10. I strongly recommend it to those considering buying it. When you get the game, lean back and savor the spirit of challenge and the joy you'll feel when you finally defeat that boss despite the difficulties.Note: I wish they'd explain the controls of this game with keyboard icons rather than Xbox ones.",1
Positive,"So nice I bought it twice. Imported it for the Xbox One, played through it about four times. Beautiful game, shitty Xbox version due to the 900p 30fps frame drops (yes, really). Absolutely a gem of a game, right up there for GOTY for me with Persona 5. The soundtrack is probably my favorite, but the best Souls game is easily Dark Souls. However, DS3's port is so much better that i'd have to recommend it over 1 or 2. Pros- Top tier music, as always- Summoning is at it's best, it's not off and on like in other Souls games- The max HP reduction from DS2 is gone. That was and will always be a horrible idea. Dark Souls is about skill first, then trial and error. To punish a player for dying and trying to learn from mistakes was a fuck up on FromSoft team B's part. - The landscapes. Jesus. It's really so beautiful, especially at the throwback location (won't spoil it) after the chapel. Cons - Gimmicky boss fights. Not saying they all are, but Yhorm? Really? The deacons? Why even give them a boss health bar? Pointless fights, even if one was a reference to Demon's Souls. - Length. For the final game in the series, this game was not long enough. You could just tell they were going to release DLC, you could feel it after beating the game. Though the ending does tie everything up (kinda, not really) there's just not enough substance there for it to feel like a full game. - Continuity. Remember in DS1, how everything was connected? From firelink to anor londo, to practically anywhere, the game told you how you got there, and about 90% of the time, you could even see the places you were, or will be soon. It felt great, kind of reminded me of Ocarina of Time. This begs the question, why was DS1 the only game that had this? Dark Souls 2 was all kinds of fucked. They had a poison gas swamp below a volcanic dungeon, a castle that just leads into a dragon's den (how convinent), and the DLC doesn't explain how you get there. You kind of just warp. Plus the DLC is even cheaper than the base game. But that's irrelivant to the point. - Difficulty. Maybe it's playing and finishing all the Souls games, but this game was damn easy. No, not in the way Gwyn is supposed to be, I mean beating the abyss watchers on the second try, before any guides were even out for the game, in a blind run. Why is High Lord Wolnir, arguably one of the coolest fucking souls bosses ever, easier than the Capra Demon, a boss an hour into the first game? The ancient dragon, pre-patch, was one of the hardest Souls bosses in DS2. In this game, you kill a dragon with a plunge attack. A FUCKING PLUNGE ATTACK? The only bosses I raged on was nameless king, because the camera was glitching out, an issue quickly fixed by fromsoft. The final boss whooped my ass too for about a dozen deaths or so. I didn't really rage at that though persay, it was actually the classic DS great feeling of being killed, but learning something each time about the boss' move set. Overall, Dark Souls III is lacking in some aspects, but to me, it's almost as good as the first because of the music, art style, and hours of enjoyment and satisfaction it did give. If I had to make a list of best to worst, it would go like this; DS> BB > DS3> DS2> DemonsSouls > DS2SOFS",1
Positive,"Yeah yeah, best Cockfight simulator i've ever played.",1
Positive,"Best game in the Souls series in many ways. While the level design in 1 is superior, 3 comes close to that in quality. As for combat, FROM has learned and taken the more responsive combat from 2 and improved upon that, making this the best technical experience in the series. With months of support post-launch and a new DLC coming out next month, this is a finely tuned experience that is more than worthy of the Dark Souls franchise.",1
Positive,"One of the most accessible Dark Souls, runs well, looks great",1
Positive,"I'm having a blast with this game. Even though I'm a bit late for the party, there are still players who invade, duel, gank, coop. So much joy invading or being invaded and always getting stuck in all sorts of funny situations, getting ganked, betrayed by the other invader, every now and then encountering some toxic player which spices things up, making me crack my knuckles and say something along the lines of ""Oh yeah.? Just you wait, I'll show you, you little **** or owning 3 phantoms and the host 1 by 1. Getting revenge and giving them all the point down.",1
Positive,"Dark Souls 3 was the game I had been eager to play for a long time, even before I had a PC, and I was so glad to finally be able to play this masterpiece. The game boasts the best quality among the three, having the privilege of being the latest in the trilogy. The best part for me was undeniably the bosses, Dark souls 3 has the most enjoyable fights in the entire series. While I acknowledge that the game failed to surpass its predecessors in certain aspects, such as the masterfully crafted world design and atmospheric brilliance of Dark Souls 1 and the intricate lore of Dark Souls 2, I didn't mind the simplicity. Besides, the game has excellent level design. I just admire the game's aesthetics; the art direction just won me over, as expected from a FromSoftware game. Music in this game is simply iconic. The haunting melodies and intense orchestral pieces add depth to every encounter, making each moment very memorable. The DLCs just elevate the game's experience, which is a consistent trend throughout the entire series. And if you care, I want to say that I took (and finished) the 'Dark Swols' challenge, where you do push-ups when you die, and I am kind of proud of it. (lol) The game concluded the series in the best possible way, cementing Dark Souls as my favourite game trilogy of all time. Praise the Sun!",1
Positive,"This game is brilliant. It takes all the parts of the original, mixes it with some ideas from Dark souls 2, and then takes the mastery of combat and atmosphere from Bloodborne and creates a masterpiece. I of course think there are a few problems with the game, especially because it's AAA game, but it is as close to perfect as I expect from a videogame.It's my favorite game to date, and it really feels like it's an improvement from Dark souls 1, mostly because of the bigger budget, better tech and more development time.The game looks great, even though it has some freezes here and there, which doesn't surprise me since this is a namco game. They are not known for good PC ports sadly, but this one feels more solid, which probably is because of the backlash from ports they have made in the past.All the different builds and classes have been balanced out. Now you can choose between how many Ashen Estus flasks (They restore mana) and how many Estus Flasks you want. This means that magic is a lot more useful.Weapons also have weapon arts, that basicly use up mana to do cool things like buffing you, penetrating shields and more! Shortbows can now also be good for long ranged combat and have special weapon arts so you can quickly do damage from a far with the cost of losing mana.This means that all builds use mana, and I even, who focused on DEX and Vigor, ended up using some pyromancies to give my sword fire damage and make me more resistant to fire. At the same time pyromancies are now scaled so the most awesome pyromancies require you to level up in intelligence and faith. In the original game, pyromancy was great for every build, which I honestly found irritating, since it made it so everyone used pyromancy. Something that i found got a litte repetitive.You can also speed up spellcasting with rings and putting points into dexterity which is great for sorcerers!This is great in my opinion! I love the fact that an armor is usefull to begin with. Even though taking care of your character and making them as powerful as you can is a great part of the game, having a new armor set and being able to just use it the minute you get is great!The locations in Dark Souls 3 are very diverse, though sometimes it seems like they are just trying to play with your nostalgia. I won't mention the locations, since spoiling it removes the fun, but just be sure to know that if you have played the original dark souls, you will be happy to see all the old locations, but also feel a little irritated. Though overall the locations are great and there are of course hidden areas with bosses and loot!The bosses are great! Some of they require a lot of skill, some of them not so much. Though generally I found them to way better than dark souls 2's bosses. Though in my opinion dark souls 2 was shit. I would say that they are about as good as dark souls 1's. They better fight in the technical department, but they a little less memorable. Luckily the bosses are all new, and are not just new versions of old bosses. They are a fun, challenging and satisfying. There is one boss in the game that comes up in the middle of the campaign that i found to be way too hard. Probably the only boss i can't without help.The game has a few issues though. This is mostly because of the mutiplayer. Firstly there is a bug that makes it so players lack animations. This normally also means that if you are invading or co-oping with another player, all the enemies in their world have no animations and won't be able to hurt you.I have recently seen it way less, so maybe they have fixes it.Another problem is that apparently you can't play mutiplayer if you have a VAC ban. I am not entirely sure how it works, since i experienced no problems in that field. Though if you have a VAC ban i would recommend not buying the game at it's current state, unless you are fine with not being able to player mutiplayer.A thing that i found was done surprisingly well were the warping bonfires. Normally shortcuts make you use older bonfires since they are all of sudden close to areas and bosses and I found that there are a lot of shortcuts compared to the original. The shortcuts are less about making the traveling time between areas shorter though and more about making the individual areas feel connected. It did feel like some areas got less used, but honestly it was not a big problem for me, and it felt like it was a thing that the development team wanted to get right.There are a lot of things to go into, but generally this game rocks! It's not as hard as people say, it just requires a little patients and being open to failing. If you don't fail you will never succeed. It has some problems that I find to be really irritating, but most of them will probably be fixed in patches.Enjoy dying, I know i did, and have fun exploring the world of dark souls!",1
Positive,"This game is really fun but it's been months with the servers down which means all the multiplayer aspects of the game are simply gone, which is too bad because, by design, that's a significant part of the game. When servers are back up I'll give it a positive review.EDIT: The servers are back up after the better part of a year, but hey it's an amazing game and now with full functionality. I can fully recommend you get this game as long as you like a challenge.",1
Positive,Best game I ever owned for 3mins.,1
Positive,It's a nice game,1
Positive,"Since my pc sucks, this game is a nice alternative to Elden Ring.",1
Positive,"I have changed this review to a more serious one.Dark souls 3 overall in my eyes is one of the best games I have ever played.The game is extremely challenging, which is what I thrive; challenge.I will be doing a list of Pros and Cons to give you an indication on what the game is about and hopefully sway you to experience this brilliant game for yourself.Pros:- Depending on if you like a challenge, then you'll love this game.- The mechanics are much cleaner than Dark souls 1 and 2, although they could be improved.- You get what you pay for, there are mutliple endings to this game with a big story which takes a long time to complete if you're new to the game.- The game is gorgeous, there are many moments when you just run around to look at the scenery and the skylines this game offers.- The bosses themselves are unique, they're all diferent and have all unique in their own way varying in challenge.- If you are a collector, then this game is full of collectables for you to collect (Rings, Miracles, Pyromancies and Sorceries.)- The combat system is always tactical as there can be different ways you can take down enemies or even a boss, always stays fresh.- Great customisable characters, as you can choose the class you want to be but also what they look like which the Soulsbourne games do very well.- The DLC 1 and 2 are brilliant, although they are short, they're worth it. The pure challenge and skill you need to beat the DLC is incredible and it will not be an easy challenge.- Offers you a lot of variation with the classes you can do as you can go for a Magic or a Combat character.- The speedrunning community are lovely, if you ever wanted to go into this category.Cons:- With it being so challenging, it may be 'too much' as you could give up with the game entierly. (git gid)- The online play can be very annoying as if you don't have any friends who play this game it will be hard to fight off against multiple players online to beat them and get an offering.- If you're wanting to complete covenant by getting 30 offerings it can be a chore as I grinded for multiple hours to get the drops from specific enemies. (Unless you get them from online play.)- It can be very repetitive and boring if you keep doing the NG+ saves.Ultimately, I think this game is a 9/10 and is definitely worth buying (Even the DLC)",1
Positive,"Dark Souls 3Rating: 9/10Genre: RPG Third PersonThe Good:+ This is the best looking Dark Souls both from a technical and artistic perspective. Many areas have beautiful vistas allowing you to take in the entire world and see many locations you previously visited, making you feel like you are part of something larger. + The level design is some of the best I have seen in a Dark Souls game. Every area feels amazing to explore and unlocking new shortcuts always feels satisfying.+ Every area has a very distinct atmosphere and level design. You can go from navigating deadly swamps to tight filled corridors and it all feels natural. + Combat has been altered. Things feel a bit faster than other Dark Souls games. I also found rolling to be more effective at dodging attacks than previous titles. + Multiple way of developing your character. + Boss battles look amazing and require real strategy and skill to take down. The Average:+/- A minor gripe I have are bonfire placements are placed too close together. Bonfire s in Dark Souls has always been a sense of relief, a place to regroup and go out and face new dangers. In this game I felt like I was running into a bonfire much more often than usual. The Bad:- NPC quest lines play a more prominent role, yet many of them require very specific things to do, and if you advance far into the game without completing a previous requirement you end up missing out. Even after reading a walkthrough, I thought to myself How is anybody suppose to figure this out on their own? - Once again UI can be really improved upon. You would expect the third game would fix some of these issues. - No pause button Conclusion:Easily my favorite Dark Souls game. Overall level design and mechanics seem to be refined and improved upon in most ways. I am not sure if I m just getting better at these types of games or they are making things easier, either way Dark Soul games have become one of my favorite franchises.",1
Positive,"As far as gameplay goes, this is the perfected iteration of the Dark Souls formula. I still appreciate some things in Demon's Souls better (ambiance, Tower of Latria, straightforward design), some things in Dark Souls 1 better (the ""Open"" world or the world design in general is better over there). Dark Souls 3 takes the speed of combat from Bloodborne in a Dark Souls context with a huge variety of weapons and playstyles. It takes a bit from every other Souls game that came before it and combines it to make a great game. The DLC really elevates the game from being a good one to being a legendary one. I love this game and love the DLC. I could talk about this game endlessly. the Berserk references, the references to other old anime movies as well as medieval mythology and it's own flavor. A true sequel to Dark Souls 1, almost to a flaw. Not going to overextend much about this game because chances are you already know all of this and have come to this game after trying other From Software games. This is the most polished gameplay wise from the trilogy+Demon's, the general structure of the game makes it easy to replay and the DLC is simply great. Praise the Sun fellow Ashen ones!",1

Positive,"Welcome to Gank City. If you couldn't get good then we'll see ya with the Pontiffs rejects in the grimy toxic swamps. To all the SL120 sweaty lapps. Praise the sun!For real though the games Lor is very details and you could beat the game without even knowing the storyline. It's very passive and not thrown in your face. The bosses are hard the first gamethrough but after that you come back with vengeance! Where this game really shines is the PVP. There are only so many weapons, spells, armor, tactics, buffs, whatever in the game an no matter how many times I run into people with the same stuff, EVERYONE fights differently and it's like fighting them for the first time, every time. You think this game may be easy, just casually killing every enemy with ease with your 2,3 or 4 phantoms and then you see ""you've been invaded"" and you all run! lmao This game reminds you that there is someone here to make you restart. And nobody wants to restart.For all though: It is a MUST to have the mods Watchdog OR Pyroprotecc. This game has no anti cheat (except a ban wave every Tuesday) and it's stupid easy to cheat with cheat engine. People can come into your worlds with god mode or insta kill you or inject items into your inventory that can get you banned or whatever. Cheat engine should be standard when you buy this game. I can't go into Gank City for 30 minutes without running into a cheater. And to all you people who think you're a god at pvp, put away your glitches. It's not a win for you, and when I kill you without using any glitches you will get the dung pie thrown on you.",1

Positive,"The strongest entry to end phenomenal trilogy. This time with more power and more lore love. FromSoftware games never stops you loving them. Kindle your first bonfire and cary your journey to the end. Try to be that hero or die trying. Everything is so well put in this title it blows my mind. From walking courpses to the flying giant dragons. So many of well designed and scary crafted enemies. Always asking what you gonna see next. The bosses gives you tippy toe challenge where they push you to the limits. Once again some of the most amazing and breahtaking of them are made it here. Yet alone The Nameless King, Sister Friede, Gael and Darkeater Midir will stuck in you mind for a long time. If you want to beat them you gonna learn how to dance with them. Its like walking in dark fantasy dream land. From giant castles to the frozen lands of forgotten tales. One of the best parts is trying to figure it out the story itself. If you know what you killing it gives you more meaning and perspective to the whole world surrounding of dark souls. Thanks to developers who made this game more acceptable in every way. Trying to get help from other players never felt so easy. Everyone is so helpfull and great. This title showed me that Dark Souls community is the most humble of them. Seeing so many people gathering near bonfire with so many different sets of armour makes you smile. One complaint I had with this title that it was the most hardest for me cause of one soul reason. They nerfed Sourcerer class to the ground. I hope they fix this mistake in Elden ring. This is it the journey ended. . .or maybe not yet. We will meet in Elden Ring once more to test our limits.",1
Positive,"Dark Souls has come full circle. From the niche beginnings with Demons Souls all the way up to today s Dark Souls 3. What was once a game series reserved for the masochistic and patients players has grown to a brand that moves millions of games at the mere mention of its name. It has become mainstream. Is this bad? Maybe. Is this good? Maybe. Better production value and refinement are among the merits, but it is a Faustian embargo because the key element of a Souls game; its difficulty, is kind of lacking in Dark Souls 3.Booting DS3 sends you into familiar territory. A black screen, with the imposing letters once again awaits you as you slave for hours in character creation to avoid a complete farce. The introduction then sets the stage for this instalment s cryptic story. The world as we left it after Dark Souls 2 has burnt out to nearly nothing by ashes and the time has come to once again rekindle the first flame. However, it takes five carcasses these days to stoke the fires so you are called from beyond the grave with the express purpose of dragging four of the five deadbeats back to the fire and casting their dried husks into it to give people an extension on their drab and dreary world. It s more of the same, and the lore and traditionally hidden plot development is leaning heavily on the original Dark Souls for its appeal. Frankly, the amount of DS1 pandering is so extreme that it makes the two or three concrete references in DS2 look tame. After having thoroughly established that kingdoms rise and fall in the sequel, part three throws all that plot development out of the window and returns to the source to bring alienated fans back. If you, like me, actually liked The Matrix Reloaded then you ll understand why this is a bad thing. After establishing a rich world with details, mythology and lore they forgo most of it just to shoehorn some of the old stuff back in there. When you look past the story you ll still find an incredibly solid and refined action role playing game that doesn t compromise on a single thing. The starting area guides you past easy enemies, different terrain types, your first bonfire and an enemy only the truly gutsy can tackle at that point. It doesn t take long before you meet your first boss which will either kick the living daylights out of you or you ll triumphantly destroy it on your first pass. What follows is a short hike to a building on the cliff where you enter the hub of this game: Firelink Shrine. Here you ll be given your purpose, a number of helpful NPCs and not a single proper hint that the bonfire in the centre will teleport you into the main game. This first section is painstakingly crafted to teach you the fundamentals. Or not; if you re a Demons Souls veteran and have played all the other games you ll breeze through it like it was a different game. Unbeknownst to me, this had become the theme for my overall experience with DS3. After I went to the first area, a castle, I was greeted with hollows, knights, dogs and a dragon. However, none of them really presented an obstacle. Nor was the first boss, a quadrupedal knight with an ice club, much of a challenge if you re used to playing a dodge build. This continued throughout the game. Most bosses only took me one or two tries to beat. If I used summons I didn t even have to try. I hardly ever got killed. Sure I died a few times in the Dragon Keep, and Knightslayer Tsorig sure knows how to earn his name, but I never felt in any way triumphant or relieved to have passed an obstacle or have beaten a boss. Returning to the game with a different build did give me a challenge eventually, but when playing like I usually do the game was kind of a breeze. If death is your teacher in Dark Souls, then I didn t learn much this time round. For all them memes and jokes made about its difficulty, DS3 doesn t live up to its predecessors reputation.DS3 may have lost a notch in difficulty, but it certainly has gained props in its level of quality. DS 2 was mired at first for its lack of polish. Sloppy hitboxes, poor level design, bland graphics and enemy design. DS3 has got none of that; it is an amazing accomplishment in level of refinement, presentation and interface design. Hitboxes are now perfectly implemented. You can vault through two swooping swords and land on the other side unscathed. Firebreath stops exactly where it seems to stop and a giant s foot only stomps where it lands. This is a colossal improvement over 2 s dingy detection. The improvements don t end there. The game is gorgeous. Skyboxes create an amazing sense of scale while the miniscule details in the world make each area vibrant and alive (despite the fact that everything is dead). Capes and cloaks look absolutely gorgeous and you have all the options to make your character look truly stunning. The game runs excellently at 60fps at 1080p on a GTX970. FROM also made a considerable effort to make the regular enemies a lot more interesting. From your regular zombies to ravenous beasts, there are some incredibly creative designs. Some enemies are as challenging as bosses themselves, without being cheap like in DS2. Speaking of bosses, despite some of them being stupidly easy, a good number of them are still amazing. I d have to say that they re more cool than hard, but the hardest bosses in the game also happen to be the coolest. Imagine a pope with lightsabres, or an insanely intense fight against a dragon rider knight, without any gimmicks. These are the game s highlights and the moments where I enjoyed the game most. Not everything is perfect though. While a lot of systems have seen significant polish, quite a few enhancements that were introduced in DS2 were dropped along with its lore. The power stance in gone, replaced with special dual weapons; reducing the creative weapon matching to almost zero. Poise is gone; the game did away with it entirely; enemies still hit you through walls; new game+ is severely lacking in features; NPC quests are more vague than ever before and often end without warning. None of these issues are game breaking. The overall whole is extremely solid and amazingly well engineered. It is just so perplexing that many of the systemic improvements from DS2 were removed. I guess streamlining is the keyword here, but that still doesn t make up for the inability to wield two repeater crossbows. Another massive gripe stems from PVP. The implementation of a password system to hook up with your friends is also extremely welcomes (seriously, this password system is the best thing since the white soapstone). However, the tweaks to PVP matchmaking are horrible. The game now biases invasions to intrude the world of a host with a phantom. That way, the invader has to face at least two, more powerful opponents, with a possible blue spirit joining the host to fend off the invader. Meanwhile, invaders can kill each other, despite pursuing the same goal. PVP is reserved to the truly committed invaders with the skill and ability to pull off these feats. After thirty hours the credits roll on what was to me the easiest Souls experience I had had up to that point. It was by no means a bad journey. It looks and runs amazingly, the combat is still fun and the online component runs like clockwork most of the time. It is refined to the point of perfection, but certain elements are up for debate in both terms of gameplay and plot. Without a doubt the best Dark Souls experience available on PC.This review was edited to fit the character count. Certain illustrations and elaborations were omitted. Feel free to ask questions.",1

Positive,"Wow, What can't I say good about the game that has me hooked like wildfire. This was my first real playthrough of a souls game, of course after I played it I went out and beat the other 2, just to say I did and also because I fell in love with the Rich Lore of this game. Every item you pick up in the game has a description and most of them can be traced to something in the previous games. You can find subtle hints of things you've seen before in the game and hints about bosses and the purpose of the placements of items. And the gameplay in this one is far more polished than the previous two, (save for the low stamina costs, but to be honest with the way these bosses work, you need to dodge a ton.)From the Very beginning of the game they pit you against a tough boss if your new to the souls series, but don't let anything intimidate you in this game. Take the world of Lordran/Lothric by storm, head in without fear of dying because you probuly will die and there is nothing you can do about it. Just learn from every encounter and be sure to recover your souls. Your in for a wild ride, not for the faint of heart or for those weak in courage. The game has plenty to offer in terms of multiplayer as well. You can team up with 3 other friends to take on the challenges of the game which can be some of the most fun in the game, but beware you are also suseptable to being invaded by another player who wants to take your ass for a ride and then kill you. Then again you could turn to the same method and go invading yourself. The game also has a dueling community, aka a group of players who participate in friendly duels with one another. The latest DLC for the game has streamlined the whole dueling process by adding matchmaking to dueling. You can also do 2v2, 3v3, 4 and 6 man free for alls and more.Final Verdict: Dark Souls 3 is a challenging experience, with a ton of replay Value. The game will grow on you if you let yourself get hooked. Also a great game to play with some friends! BIG NOTICE: CONTROLLER HIGHLY RECCOMENDED.This Game is near impossible to play with Keybindings. Get a damn controller if you wanna play.",1

Positive,"This game is one of the best games i've ever played. It has one of the best lores, extremely challenging, The experience becomes better if you talk about the story with your friends and have the volume on while playing :) and much much more <3 In my personal experience 70% percent of the people playing this game are using 3rd party program or cheat engine or at least around that percentage. Thats really unfortunate, So what i highly recommend you to do before activating "" Play online "" or going online in this game is > Back up your ds1, ds2 and ds3 file. How do you do that? Go to > This computer or This PC > Users > your computers name > App Data > Roaming and click on ds3 or any of the ds games. So now you've got a folder thats "" Users ID "" that folder has a file, That file is your in game progressing save. Please back up that file by manually copy and pasting it from time to time or even better everytime you close the game. Paste it into your other Hard Drive ( HHD) or anywhere you feel like it'll be safe in :)Why do you wanna do all of that? Is firstly because Steam Cloud doesn't support this or any ds games :) So it's not like Csgo, dota2 or many other games that save automatically in your steam account. So because some hackers with bad intentions not only kill people unfairly and gain little to no fun >.< But they also have bad ways to force a bugged or a hacked item into your inventory that can cause a soft ban or corrupt your files :/ or simply dropped hacked items for you to pick up if you are new to the game that will ruin your system.I lost my account twice first time i lost my level 210 character is because i formatted my computer and i didn't know that steam cloud doesn't support ds3 :< And the second time i lost my level 281 character is because i picked up a bugged or a hacked item that ruined my system so i decided to delete all my save files >.< and i've read later on that it's not needed to delete the account, but the character itself. and what i also read about the soft ban ( soft ban is a temporary that prevents you from playing online until you delete or remove the hacked bugged item that you picked up) So soft ban goes away after couple of weeks but i haven't experienced it myself and i hope i wont ever again >.< Thank you and i wish you the best of luck and a wonderful experience on your ds3 journey!",1
Positive,"I've never played any game that had swordplay before or third person. I actually thought I would hate this game to its guts, but the hype from the fanbase was just too much. I decided to preorder and give it a shot. When I began playing the game on the first day, I struggled to use keyboard and mouse(A shame there is no kb/m overlay). As a result, I died many times and I kept struggling to actually attempt to enjoy the game. However, after many defeats and many dissatisfactions, I finally beat my first boss WITH A KEYBOARD AND MOUSE! Now, I don't usually get hyped after completing a tutorial level, but this game was totally different. It didn't just give me some mindless skeletons to fight, but it also gave me a boss to fight, which by the way, gave me a headache.Each level was more enormous than the one before it with enemies that were sometimes huge. When I finally beat the game, I couldn't believe it was finally over. I was actually sad that there no more remaining bosses that could give me suffering and frustration. In my opinion, this game turned me into a masochist. Though, what the hell is up with all this weird English poetic stuff? Did the writers just read Shakespeare and decide to write in whatever word they thought had a good ring to it?10/10",1
Positive,"most polished souls-like game in your steam libraryits not perfect but its nice.I have great memories with this.People say Dark Souls saved their lives and more stuff. Good. Lives saved is nice.I'm here for the funny gameplay. I am an explorer who was on an adventure for no reason but 1 - I knew that someone had completed this and all the other souls-borne games without taking a single hit. That means the combat will not betray me if i'm smart and skillful enough. I felt powerful. And i did it. Slowly i move, i die i learn and i cheese i throw stuff, i talk and i run.I had fun. TL;DR - One of the Best Games to play with friends. Just don't give up on the tutorial, You can do it Ashen one. I believe in me who believes in you.

Positive,"Dark Souls 3 is my favorite game in the entire series, I have played every Souls(Borne) game in the entire series, that includes Demon's Souls, Bloodborne.This game came out on top with the ton of references to the other games in the series, and it did a damn good job respecting the series, and might I say it. Going out with a BANG.The ending in Dark Souls 3 is incredible, it's super powerful for anyone who has played the previous entries in the series. I of course won't spoil it, that would be really stupid of me. (But seriously, I REALLY recommend playing Dark Souls 1/2 before even playing this, if you don't do that you won't get the references to the previous games and the ending sure as hell won't be as powerful. It's the perfect ending to a strong adventure of which I am so happy that I have partaken in during all these years)The Armors, the weapons, the characters, the music. Dark Souls 3 has some of the strongest music tracks in the series, from the main theme, to the final credits theme. The final music in the credits practially whispers to you in a soft way Finale And they completely nailed it.The amount of friends I have taken through the lands of Lordran, Drangleic and even all the way down to the lowest of the lowest of the Nexus in Demon's Souls. Playing this game with my friend who has kept me company during all the other Soul games was truly amazing. We decided to solo the final boss instead of coop, for obvious reasons. and it was so powerful.(I have played way more solo, rather than coop. I'm not a carried scrub, I do the carrying trust me)I'm not kidding, I think I have literally taken more than 15 people through the lands of Dark Souls, and every single adventure has been amazing.(As a matter of fact, as of writing this review I'm taking another friend of mine through Dark Souls 3, It's an amazing series and I have to show it to people.)Dark Souls is a franchise that will go all the way down through the years in gaming, and people will relish and remember this series. And people will remember the ending of Dark Souls 3 and say - ""That's how you end a franchise"" Writing all of this I realise how much of a nerd I am, but I am super proud of this series, and everyone who has stayed strong with this series. Thanks all of you, even the toxic Havel armor wearing scrublords, we love all of you.PRAISE THE SUN! \[T]/",1
Positive,Great game with awesome levels design and really challenging bosses. Love the look and feel of this game. I still think the first dark souls is better but this is a true sequel to the first game. I'll give this game a 4.7/5 and I'll recommend this game to everyone.,1
Positive,"The sequel that the original Dark Souls deserved is a stunning game. The third is not only the most challenging part of the Souls series, but it's the most dynamic, fluid and deep in gameplay. The more linear design is founded in variety of challenges that force the player to adapt in their approach to combat, but there still is plenty of hidden areas and branching paths to keep you guessing, immersing yourself in exploration.",1

Positive,"Dark Souls III is something truly incredible. It has managed to provide me with a gut-wrenching, arduous experience. I have never felt so convulsed while playing a video game. It has made me feel short of breath as I peered through every dark and narrow opening, hunting for each and every achievement in the game. Dark Souls III has managed to antagonise myself enough for me to be yelling at the computer screen and release unconventional anger. If by any chance, you ever feel as though you should be playing this game, or that you are missing out on something very enjoyable, please do not ruin your life for $60 and just go and entice yourself to GTA V for an extra $15. Type 'PAINKILLER' in the console and you will be smiling like a kid that just lost his virginity.11/10 EXTREMELY rewarding but requires an immense amount of time, patience and persistence.I LOVE you Dark Souls III !",1
Positive,"Read this if you just want to hear what I think about the game.Dark Souls III does just enough to make the gameplay loop feel fresh, with refined combat mechanics as well as a couple of new features. Its bosses are all well-designed, and so are the many areas. It does feel a little too safe, leaning too much on the lore of the first game, resulting in a backstory not as engaging as that of the first Dark Souls.+ Well-designed bosses+ The overall selection of areas is very satisfying+ Lots of potential in terms of character builds- Feels a bit safe, especially with the lore consisting mostly of references to the first game.- Inconsistent framerateSCORE: GreatClick here to see my rating chartRead this if you want all the details.The Dark Souls series is probably one of the most influential in gaming. Dark Souls 3 marks the end of a beloved series, but is it as good as it's predecessors?Let's start with probably the most important part of a Soulsborne game - the gameplay, and more specifically, the combat. At first, it might seem like there isn't anything new here, other than the combat feeling more refined and less clunky. But as you begin to acquire more weapons, you'll probably introduce yourself to one of the biggest changes to combat: Weapon Skills. Each weapon has a certain skill that can be used in combat. This could be something as simple as a flurry attack, or something as cool as setting the area around you on fire. I'm pretty sure these skills are inspired by the trick-weapons seen in Bloodborne, and while they aren't as fleshed out as those, they still help make the weapon selection feel a bit more varied. The way magic works have also been altered a bit. In the first game, each spell had a specific amount of times it could be cast before you weren't able to use it until you reached the next bonfire. In this game, From Software has introduced a new bar besides Health and Stamina, called Focus. Focus is used every time you cast magic or use a weapon skill, and can also be filled by consuming Ashen Estus Flasks or resting at a bonfire. I do feel like this system would've worked better if the bar would automatically regenerate, as the amount of times you can use magic feels very limited, and makes character builds focused on magic less powerful overall. One of the most iconic things in the Soulsborne series is, of course, the boss battles. In Dark Souls 3 there's not as many in total as in previous entries, but they do feel more varied, and some of them present some very cool ideas. Just like in Bloodborne, most bosses have multiple phases, each with their own moves. This is a good addition to the great boss design and makes each boss a lot more unpredictable. My biggest issue with the bosses in the game is that most of them don't feel very challenging compared to the ones the first game presented. There were only a few bosses where I really felt like one single mistake would be fatal, and most of these were found towards the latter half of the game. What helped me to accept this is how none of them felt like a bad boss. Even though the first game had some of the finest and most well-designed bosses in a game, it did also have a lot of bland and uninspired ones, such as the tedious Bed of Chaos. The same could be said for some of the game's areas - just take a look at Lost Izalith. This is another place where I feel like this game struck gold - out of the many areas, there wasn't a single one which outright irritated me. Sure, there were a couple of areas that were a bit bland, but the overall selection was very good. It did have your occasional poison swamps, but even those felt like a fair experience. This is mainly due to the fantastic level design. Everything seems so thoughtfully put together and results in an overall satisfying experience. The game was sometimes too generous with its bonfires, and there was even a time where two bonfires were pretty close to each other, with no enemies in between. I do miss the interconnectivity of the first game, and I had really hoped that this would be something FromSoftware would try to do again with this game. It isn't a major complaint, but just something I would've liked to see.In terms of lore, the game leans heavily on references to the first game, and I would wish it had introduced a story on the level of that of Gwyn's from the first game, as many of the new characters simply doesn't feel as fleshed out as the ones found in Dark Souls 1. I can appreciate the fact that the game reintroduces an area from the first game, as well as a couple of well-known faces, but its lore leans too much towards this, resulting in everything feeling a bit safe. This is the biggest problem I have with the game overall - it plays a lot on nostalgia, instead of taking chances, like FromSoftware usually is known for. I haven't seen all of the NPC quests through, but judging from the ones I did, I felt like most of them ended with the NPC invading me, forcing me to kill them. The game could've had a bit more variety here. I've always thought the Soulsborne games had some amazing sceneries, and this is also the case here. While the graphics aren't anything impressive upfront, the sceneries are what makes the game so beautiful. There's always been a charm in standing at the top of an area, looking down on everything you've just overcome, while also being able to see what the game has in store for you next. While the game ran pretty well on my mid-range PC, I did experience some stuttering at times, and somehow adjusting the graphics settings doesn't really do any noticeable difference. Just by doing a quick search online, it seems I'm not the only one with these problems, and it sounds like it's an issue regardless of how good your PC is. Also, the game really doesn't do a good job at hiding that it was made with consoles in mind. In fact, even while using keyboard and mouse, the game will still display controls as if you were playing with a controller, meaning that whenever you're in doubt what to press, you have to go into the options menu. I, of course, decided to play with a controller, as that tends to be the best for these kinds of games, and even then, I had problems with setting it up, since the official profile resulted in the mouse cursor moving whenever the game detected movement from your controller. After some adjusting though, everything worked fine, and just if I was playing on a regular console.If you liked this review, I would appreciate it if you took the time to check out some of my other reviews here.

Positive,"This game is just amazing, the lore is pretty tricky to follow but when you star to understand it and love it. the exploration is so deep and terrifying, the coop is amazing and the boss fight are always so intense and full of joy when you beat that damn boss who kicked your ass thousands of times.Thanks to all people that played with me online (even you invaders) you make the experience much better",1

Positive,"absolutely fantastic game, its a lot tougher than elden ring in some areas but overall a very good game with unique bosses and areas to explore.",1
Positive,Invasions are really fun in this game. 10/10 would reccommend to someone looking for a unique PVP experience.,1
Positive,"Masterful architecture, stunning graphics, wonderful level design, full of shorcuts and the fights. The tactical side behind each fight leaves so spoiled that every other game fighting mechanic seems rather simplistic and boring in comparison.Definitely, the culmination of one of the most engrossing trilogies I've ever witnessed and an absolute, maddening joy to play and to master.10/10",1
Positive,"Dark Souls 3 is a pretty good, but certainly not great ending to the Souls series. Playing this game I never did got the same great vibe I got from Dark Souls 1 & 2. Some of the bosses on the game or nothing short of disappointing, the questlines to some characters have little payoff (though some are great), and the game leans very heavily on past nostalgia from Dark Souls 1, with improved combat mechanics. Buuut. Did I hate this game? Oh no. I loved it. It is a Souls game still, true and true. The lore is amazing, and still found through gameplay and not cutscenes. Combat is faster than ever, there are even more amazing boss weapons, and some areas are larger than before. But there are aspects of it that will frustrate you.Pros: -Faster combat, and maneuverability -Some areas are definitely longer. -Still has the good old Souls feel -Lore is given to the interested players through very optional ways -PvP funner than ever -Co-op with friends is easier, with a password that allows you to summon only those with the same password Cons:-Wether the new weapon skill system was neccessary, is subjective. -Some areas are definitely longer. but there are fewer of them and some are very very annoying. -Summoning is sometimes a pain in the ass, as it fails if you summon more than 1 phantom simultaneously. -End bosses are mostly disappointing. -A lot of unwarranted nostalgia from DS1 holds this game up -Seems a little too easy for some.",1
Positive,A peaceful autumn game.,1
Positive,"TL;DR - The concept is good. I love how the game conveys that this is Dark Souls 3 . The gritty atmosphere, and the lore behind it, is attractive and interesting. However, the overall gameplay is a bit of disappointment. IMHO, the game is good for only the FIRST playthrough.PvP / Invading / Dueling is kind of nice, on paper, really, but it is actually kind of broken, when it comes to real thing.Be warned, your first playthough can takes from 10-60 hours depending on your playstyle, however, your following playthrough can be finished much faster. (3-5 hours)Feel likes more reading? Continue below:(I won t be mentioning about what is good already, but the disappointments)I wouldn t dare say that the game can be described as hard, nor challenging, but instead, imo, punishes those who blindly rush in thinking that they can slash their ways through the mobs.I am certain that you will be sent back to the bonfire for a few times in each newly discovered areas/encounters, but once you learnt about each of them, you can easily control each encounter, then after that, comes down to how you perform for each fight.Despite what I mentioned above, here is a big BUT , they are all coming down to one single problem. The badly designed AI.Let s say, you masked your approach with a spell (silencing your steps), you melee one mob from the group, the nearby members will notice you (if they are actually nearby). However, if you change your approach, getting close enough to shoot with arrows/bolts, and then pull it away from the group. Not a soul will notice that his/her friend is missing.Again, you are facing one trouble-some beast on the small bridge (for its size), you decided to pull back from the bridge area hoping to get away from the beast, then found out that it won t follow you off the bridge area, and decided to stand and stare at you in the face, you then attempt to get into melee range, and bash away with your half-upgraded weapons, surprisingly, it stare back at you, doing nothing, but backing away until you get on the bridge again, allowing you free hits.Okay, you are on the narrow cliff, you saw a guy rushing down toward you at full speed, so you decided to dodge his attack. As he got close enough, he began charging toward you with his weapon at full-strength, you saw this opportunity, and rolled to the side, looking back to get ready for this guy. He s not there anymore, but off the cliff into his own abyss.These are some examples. There are many cheap ways to end the tough encounters, that you will find out during your playthrough, which is kind of sad.Just for your knowledge with the right equipments/setups, you can run through the whole things (not a completed one, but met all critical paths) in just a few hours, as you can just dash past everything to reach the boss.It is kind of pointless, imo. It is nice on the paper, but the actual thing is not. I am not talking about the rule, nor the honor or that kind of stuff, but the design itself.During my playthrough, I can hardly find Invaders that are not lagging, these can be resulted as weird hitboxes, not correctly displayed weapon ranges, delayed reactions, warping, or even ranged critical attacks. Trust me, facing likes 10 of these in a row is not fun. It is good when it works though. It just that, imo, the devs seem to forget to put in the factor that, not everyone is in the perfect conditions for these thing. Let s say, instead of the player invaders, it should be likes AI invaders, but takes the stats/equipments from other actual players, and make PvP into some kind of arena match. These would do a better job in handling smooth gameplay for more people than what it currently is, imo.I will be updating this later, If I feel right to do so.edit: typos",1
Positive,"This game really does go beyond the previous two games. Dark Souls 3's combat system and mechanics are sound, function properly, and goddamn i wish I could say the same about the first one.Problem; AI. for some reason, when Embered and invaded by mad spirits/dark spirits, trying to parry them or even get a backstab is near impossible, and when you make consecutive hits, all of a sudden, magic parry, adn then your health dwindles down to nothing. So I guess it's all swish swish stab and back away.Still, it take everything into a blender, mashes it up and throws the odd pickle in it, to give it some zest I guess. Even though that ticks me, I thoroughly enjoy it and see it as a great game for new players to try.",1

Positive,Best rage couch game ever,1
Positive,"Never feel like you're actually good at PvP because just remember, on your opponent's screen, you're teleporting everywhere.Also, lightning miracles OP.",1
Positive,"This game started off slow in all honesty, atleast until you beat the first 3 bosses, which should take like 1 - 2 hours, but this game after that threshold is absolutely amazing, the bosses are awesome, the level design is awesome, the game is just straight up awesome, I love this and don't regret buying it one bit, I almost like it as much as Elden Ring, but this game definitely has better overall bosses than Elden Ring, and is also (in my opinion) harder, especially the endgame bosses",1
Positive,"Over the last few years, From Software has grown in reputation thanks to the series and being one of the most challenging on the market. The previous Dark Souls I felt stepped away from what made the series great and left From Software in a position to recover with Dark Souls III. With 3, we have a mix of old and new designed to push (and punish) players further.Undead Again:As with previous games in the Souls series, you are an undead being cursed to wander the land until you eventually become hollow or insane. Upon awakening, you are given a quest to return the lords of cinder to their throne; this entails wandering a very big land and dying a lot. Just like the other games, there is a deep story hidden behind the lore, but I'm going to leave that for someone more versed in it to talk about.The basics of the Souls are on full display here: Using a skill and timing-based combat system, you're going to be fighting enemies of all shapes and sizes while looking for shortcuts and the ever vital bonfires for checkpoints. As with Dark Souls 2, bonfires automatically allow you to teleport to them once found; allowing for quick travel to and from.Gone is the controversial adaptation stat that affected invincible frames, and the game is back to keeping them consistent across characters. There are a few new base changes to the gameplay to give players more options. The first is that your eastus flask which is your only source of healing is now split into two. You have one flask for healing and one flask for recovering flame points or FP. FP is used for using spells and special skills that are unique to each weapon type.The skills are a holdover from Bloodborne and are meant to give you more options in combat, and allow melee-focused characters a reason to boost their FP up.You can assign how many of your total charges to the different flasks, and of course upgrade your flasks to restore more with each swig.Previous games had a mechanic built around living and dying in the game: From the complex and level altering light/dark tendency in Demon's Souls, to a simple measurement in the previous Dark souls.In Dark Souls III, you can use ember to earn a flame which gives you a higher max health and puts you in a position to summon help or be invaded as long as you don't die.You'll need all of these, as Dark Souls III continues the difficult tradition of the series.Swinging a Sword:The Souls series is known for having very challenging and rewarding combat, thanks to diverse enemies and boss fights. Dark Souls III definitely takes things up a notch in both areas. Regular enemies are more varied and a lot more dangerous this time around.The reason is that enemies are faster, more aggressive and have been given more combo chains for their attacks. In previous games, an enemy would attack at most two or three swings in a single chain. Now, they will attack with more swings in a single string and their strings are more varied.For instance, enemies may perform three swings that look the same, but have two or more different combo endings to them. They also have more attacks, including those designed to punish players for using previously effective strategies.I've ran into enemies who knew how to get around circle strafing or attack you if you keep swinging too much.Bosses are also more varied and remind me of Dark Souls 1 in terms of variety and different solutions to beating them. Just like before, you can summon characters to help you or be summoned to recover your flame and get some souls in the process.From a moment-to-moment standpoint, Dark Souls III continues the greatness of the series, but there are some issues hiding under the surface.Hollowed Out:Dark Souls 3 has all the good elements of previous Souls games, but it also has all the bad as well. The camera continues to have trouble with not getting stuck while fighting larger enemies and the increased speed makes it hard for it to keep up.Of the three games and Demon's Souls (haven't played Bloodborne yet,) this one takes the cake for roughest start for new players. Unlike Demon's Souls that had a great beginning to run things by the player, you are thrust within minutes into your first boss fight and expected to learn or die.What makes Dark Souls different from Demon s was the fact that the world was open-ended; allowing you to explore different sections that were still connected to the world's geography. Dark Souls 3 feels somewhat limited in this regard. The starting areas have a sameness to them and the connectivity between areas has been downplayed in favor of just shortcuts within each area. While this is better than the confusing world of Dark Souls 2, it doesn't beat Dark Souls 1 for world creation.All the problems that have been inherent in the Souls series is back: Unhelpful camera, enemies attacking and glitching thru certain obstacles and each other, camera still getting stuck when fighting large enemies and so on. While people may have gotten used to them, it's still a mark against the game by the fact that nothing has been done it seems to try and fix them.The new concern at the moment has to be the technical issues plaguing the game and some underlining mechanic issues. There is a bug going on that causes massive framerate lost, stuttering or simply game crashes due to the lighting.It happens at specific points in the game which makes it all the more frustrating that it wasn't caught. And of course, people have been having connectivity issues with joining games. There are also issues on the console versions as well; hopefully From Software will get those straighten out.Also, there are some points to discuss with the underlining mechanics and changes of Dark Souls III. The short version is that there are several mechanical changes that impact poise and armor, and their impact on both PvE and PvP. Unfortunately, they're way too big to get into detail about here, but that will be saved for a massive post coming to Game-Wisdom soon.Light the Fire:From Software continues to make subtle improvements to the moment-to-moment gameplay, but still is having trouble with the overall problems and concerns of the series. As with previous games, you're either going to love it or hate it for its ramped up difficulty and challenging fights.If you're new, I would still suggest either Demon's Souls or Dark Souls to get your feet wet (maybe Bloodborne, but I haven't played it,) as Dark Souls III really feels like it was designed for someone with one of the games already under their belt. For me, I find the game at the moment lands too much on the side of being cheap with its mechanics to really enjoy fully. Just like with Dark Souls 2, expect a second post on Game-Wisdom talking explicitly about the gameplay to come soon.Anybody worried that this would be a continuation of Dark Souls II, fear not, Dark Souls III is clearly better in every aspect, but to compare it to one, well, I got a ""few"" words to say about that in another post.For more content on Dark Souls III, you can watch my depraved run on the Game-Wisdom YouTube channel.

Positive,"This game helps me realize that in order to face your fears, you must face them head on and keep trying and trying and trying until you've slain it. Dark Souls 3 is nothing but cope juice when the real world is against you and nothing is left but loneliness. At least for me, this game helps me forget the real world, this game allows me to adventure into the unknown alone and come out strong, this game aids in testing your limits in the right way possible. Besides sleep, this game offers nearly the same thing, peace. Peace is precious, something that needs to be held close, and to never be let loose. Mind goes blank as the game starts up, and the shift is reinstated as soon as the game closes. I cannot think much than praise. As of writing this review, I have ventured far beyond NG+7 and I am continuing to master this games' techniques. This is possibly one of the greatest games the 21st century has to offer, I cannot help but keep praising this game for everything it teaches through every error and victory. Life is Dark Souls",1

Positive,"This game really feels like the culmination of everything From and Miyazaki have been doing with the series. It's incredibly tight, combat is sped up (albeit not to the level of Bloodborne) and the world is ALIVE. Early in the game, you come to a cliff side and below you stretches, literally, the whole game. You can see all the locations you will soon be visiting, its an awe inspiring moment, and really sets the tone. Meanwhile, if you're a lore hound, prepare to boggle at how much is packed in here. Everything around you tells a story and drips with history. This really is the continuation of Dark Souls. Oh, Covenants also are majorly improved upon, allowing switching on the fly and letting players really explore play styles until they find something that really is for them. It's incredible. As of right now, I have completed the game once, clocking in at 50 hours, and have already rolled up a new character to do it again.New Game+ will happen eventually, but I wanted to go through it again with new players first. There is also a way for players to re-spec later in the game, which is nice.",1
Positive,"I have started DS3 after I completed Sekiro 3 times and honestly it felt easier. Telegraphing enemy moves and dodge is a lot fun.

There are few bosses and areas that will challenge you, thou (yes, Midir I am looking at you).Regardless, beating every boss fight and stage is epic and it satisfies you. Do not listen others that say the game is too difficult. It is challenging but if you want, you can partner with your friend and others so they can also help you.

The art, the war, the tactic, the ability to adapt and learn are all in these games.it started from demon souls and darksouls 1 and years ago i started to play these games but it remained unfinished due to compromised console. but finally i started and i am enjoying a real game.i have diminished my wishlist from over 100+ to around 24 games. and i have become strict in choosing a game to play. I never have said such a thing before but these fromsoftware games are worth complete price .see?only 6-8 games worth full price and are these. try to purchase in discounted price now tho.if u wanna enjoy your old games dont play these cause all will be trash to you as they are now to me.only few number left worthy to me.anyway praise the sun praise the fromsoftware hope the never disappoint us as they never did. and GIT GUDSo longDarkman",1

Im crap at the game however, recognising patterns has never been one of my strong points so i struggle particularly with the bosses who are heavily scripted. Still ive managed to finish the game after 70 odd hours of sheer determination and thats what makes the game so satisfying.The thrill you get after beating a boss is second to none, and even just finally navigating on of the games many beautiful areas (in a warped sort of way) is exhilarating after dozens of deaths.Theres nothing i can really say about Dark Souls 3 that hasnt been said already. it really is worth getting and sticking with if fantasy/ Rpg type games are your thing.",1
Positive,"Best Dark Souls game of the serie so far(played 23 hours in two days). Optimization is really well made. I have never had any crash or FPS drop. My settings are currently on ""MAX"" and i am having constant 45 fps with a mid budged PC.PROS: Level design is incredible and you can easily get lost in the wast world. (always some hidden places to explore)Combat system is DA BEST! It is fast paced, balanced and unforgiving.AI is clever and i mean it.

Positive,"First off; I actually beat this game. (My achievements say otherwise) This frustrating, cheap, challenging masterpiece, is one of my recent favorites. I m sad I didn t get into the series sooner. The first 40 hours or so of this game was hard for me. Since I never played a Souls game before; I didn t know how to approach combat nor how to manage my Estus. I died, a lot. However; once I got halfway through the game, I got gud as they say. Now almost to NG+ I m excited to try the game all over again. :DMy love for this series and DS3 itself will forever hold a place is my heart. PSThe Nameless King and The Abyss Watchers are my favorite Boss fights.",1
Positive,"I now put around 100 hours into this game and I can definetly recommend it. Long story short:+ graphics are really good. Most if not all locations look beautiful. The developers paid a lot of attention to details.+ sound is great and ""realistic"". Dark Souls 3 features by far the best soundtrack in the series. The theme of the Abyss Watchers is a prime example. The voice acting is also pretty good. + combat is fluid and faster as in Dark Souls and Dark Souls 2.+ a lot of armour, weapons, spells, miracles and pyromancies. + great multiplayer - yeah, it is basically the same as in 1 and 2 but this kind of multiplayer is unique compared to any other franchise (I include Demon's Souls and Bloodborne into the Souls franchise).+ really good quests which enrich the story and are not thrown into your face like in any other RPG.+ really good length. Doesn't matter if you include the DLC or not.- invasions or PVP in general can be annoying due to latency issues or lag. Only the arena (accessable while playing the DLC) features a server. The rest is P2P.- backtracking for additional armour doesn't make much sense - discover location A, 5 hours later, at location X, you kill a certrain unique enemy, armour can now be found at location A. I'm talking about Havel's armour to be specific.- the first DLC, Ashes of Ariandel, is pretty poor on it's own when it comes to length and variety. But since anybody who buys the game probably buys the complete edition anyway, this does not mean much. I just wanted to point that out. Especially since both DLC's belong together - literally. - some enemy types can be seen as a recycled version of an earlier enemy later on. It is not that obvious as in other games but still. Seems kinda lazy.I can definetly recommend the purchase of this game. It does not matter if it is on sale or not. In my opinion, it still is worth 60 bucks. Compare it to ""triple A"" trash from Activision or EA and you can pay 100 without batting an eye.",1
Positive,"Even after playing though this game countless times I still find enjoyment in starting fresh with a new challenge or build idea in mind. If you're new to this sort of game I suggest choosing the knight class since it starts off with a long sword and a shield with decent stability and complete physical damage protection. With how well distributed its stats are, you'll be able to expand out to other playstyles a short time after starting the game (e.g an intellagence, fait or pyro build). I also suggest going solo as much as you can since this will allow you to learn enemy/boss attack patterns and where you'll be able to get your hits in. Take a look around yourself when you can, by the way. Even at 720p at the lowest settings, this game looks beautiful. Especially some of the far off views that are now a part of my folder I use for desktop backgrounds.",1
Positive,"The best example for Love/Hate relationshipThis is the final game in the series for now and I am unsure if a new souls game will be released. The Ringed City DLC seems to be the last installment for the dark souls series. I am excited to see their new ip and hope it surpasses the souls series. What is DS3; If you are a fan of the Dark Souls series and completed the first two games a while back, you should purchase the third installment without delay, as I did. I believed I had experienced everything with Dark Souls, especially with Dark Souls 2, but when I purchased Dark Souls 3, I was surprised by the significant improvement from its predecessor. The difference between the two games is so vast that words cannot do it justice.It's similar to the dark souls experience we've been craving for ages.It also includes elements from previous Dark Souls games and even from Demon's Souls <3.Dark Souls 2 failed to meet my expectations, causing me to overlook Dark Souls 3. Don't repeat my mistake (even though Dark Souls 2 isn't awful and has its own charm, it didn't meet my expectations), try playing Dark Souls 3 instead. It's like a hidden gem, but in truth it holds more value than you think. I can't put my emotions into words ( ) haha :P. Good luck to everyone and enjoy playing dark souls 3 with a smile. Don't forget to remain patient and develop your own tactics to enhance your fun. DS3 differs from other Souls game series since it provides more clarity, allowing players to quickly understand their objectives, directions, and reasoning behind actions within the first 2-4 hours. However, I hold this belief because of how much our understanding of the game has grown since we first played Dark Souls 1 on the PS3/xbox360 with no prior knowledge. I could be correct or mistaken, but you should test out the game on your own. I immediately recommend that Dark Souls 3 boasts superior PvP compared to the rest of the series. I believe that, at a specific moment, it stands out as one of the greatest features in comparison to other Souls games. Examine the game to confirm or refute my assertion. I appreciate you reading my review. _Be aware from :The online matching in the game is done through the process below:-Players who do not match with the same regulation versions are excluded ""u and ur friends needs to have the same update"".-Players who cannot connect with the network type (mainly NAT3) are excluded ""TL:DR same as console type 1,2,3 idea""=Players that are outside the host range parameter will be excluded.-Players who are from different regions are excluded=Based on the host, players who have out of ranged advanced weapon levels are excludedThe player level and the weapon level are less effective in the password matching.What does that mean?If you and your friend haven't set a password, and your character level is 140 while your friend is only level 40 and just starting the game, make sure to use a password in order to bypass these limitations and assist your friendIf you want calculation: (Keep in mind the margin of error here is +/-10If the host level is 40-Minimum phantom level you could summon is=26=Maximum phantom level you could summon is=54If the host level is 120-Minimum phantom level you could summon is=98=Maximum phantom level you could summon is=142If the host level is 140-Minimum phantom level you could summon is=116=Maximum phantom level you could summon is=164",1

Positive,One of the best gaming experiences I've ever had.,1
Positive,"Brief: Score: 1000/100. An absolutely amazing 3rd Person RPG. One of the best games I ve ever played, and I recommend it to anyone looking to get into Dark Souls or continuing their adventures in Dark Souls.This game is one of the greatest games ever made. Heck, this game is one of the top three greatest artistic achievements ever made. The only negative is it's probably one of the easiest games ever made. Despite the easy sauce covering this game, Dark Souls 3 fills you with a feel good story, a sense of optimism, and never say quit attitude. This game is a breath of fresh air in the current era where game designers spend way to much time making hard games that frustrate gamers. The story is straight forward and simple. There is no need to guess or speculate. In fact it puts the story codex right on the items. Finally, on the rare occasion that you die, the game will let you know just in case you missed it. BS aside, this is really the game of the year from 2016. It makes Dishonored 2 seem like a joke. It makes Titanfall 2 look like a a newspaper comic strip. And even Witcher 3, DLC included, fails to compare. I recommend this game. If I could get a hold of a FUMES great sword, and somehow figure out a way to lift it, I would force you to buy it (for your own good).",1

Make sure to keep this in mind as it's extremely important, you don't want to lose your progress",1
Positive,"It's pretty neat, although I wouldn't consider it the best entry in the Souls games. I'm just going to list things that I enjoyed and things that I thought were done better in the previous games. So let's start with the graphics, which look very familiar if you played Bloodborne. It's definitely an upgrade to the previous Souls games and the locations are absolutely stunning so there is really nothing I could complain about in this departement. The combat is a bit faster now which is fine by me. There is also Weapons Art and the the addition of the Focus Points which I, as a UGS wielder never actually used. Perhaps it has its uses for some situations but I never encountered those. Poise is drastically changed now, I could wear full Havels and become staggered by some rat or a starved dog. I'm not sure what From was thinking when implemanting those changes. Other then that the PvE and PvP are very enjoyable and there are a lot more people to play with. The game difficulty swaps around a bit. For instance the only challenging area was Archdragon Peak for me. Maybe it's just me and after 3 games I already got used to the concept and gameplay so that's why I would consider Dark Souls 1 as the most challenging of them all. Game seems a lot shorter even for someone who has to ""100% every area available"". Steam says that I spend aroung 120 hours on DS1, DS2 and Bloodborne yet I have ""only"" 50 on DS3 and I almost finished it. All in all the game has it flaws here and there but in the end it's very enjoyable and something that I would recommend on buying to someone who enjoyed the previous games. It's also probably the best game to start with if you want to play the Soulsborne games as it seems a bit more beginner friendly.Oh, I forgot to say that the music is ridiculously good which is really worth mentioning.",1
Positive,"After 1000 hours, i'm ready to write my review, first of all i must say that this is my favorite game of all TIME, the amount of art and detail put into this game is overwhelming, Dark souls 3 is made with heart without a doubt from the soundtrack to the characters, jesus the worlds that miyazaki created in this game, i remember the first time i set foot in Irythill of the Boreal Valley i was left astonished, simply amazing.This game reminds me of the old days when i would go buy a game and get the FULL experience, no micro-transactions, only hard work to unlock all the weapons and costumes for my character, also the amount of customization for your character is amazing, there's probably more than 30+ sets to fully customize your character, you can use a single piece of each set, to create your own abomination.This is where i'm going to be a little pesimistic about the game if played on PC, the amount of cheaters is dreadful and FromSoftware doesn't give a flying duck if you were modified with GOD MODE by a hacker, you'll get banned too, i've had friends permanently banned from the online experience, just because a stupid hacker modified their account, sometimes they'll insta kill all the bosses in the map, which will cause invalid data registry in your account as well, however if you get banned you can fix this by making a family-sharing account and playing from there, still you'll have to start from 0 again and like i said FromSoftware won't give a damn if you were not cheating, they'll only see the invalid data and give you a warning to delete it or they'll perm ban, so be CAREFUL with what you pick from other players, other than that invading is AMAZING, it's hilarious to make riot in anothers ashen one's worlds.The game runs smooth if you meet the requirments 60+ fps no problems, the only problem i have encountered is if you use a DS4 with DS4WINDOWS, it can cause some crashes here and there.Dark souls 3 is worth every single penny you spend on it, it's by far the ultimate RPG adventure, if you have friends to play with, it's even better. 9/10",1
Positive,Finished the game on my PS4. One of the best fucking games ive ever played i cant wait to play it on PC :D,1
Positive,"Dark Souls 3 is technically and design wise the strongest game in the trilogy, providing both a great start to newcomers to the series and also a fitting end (hopefully) to the game series. That said it does also lack some elements that made the original more memorable and takes a step back in some regards to how Dark Souls 2 functioned. Regardless the whole game acts as a coherent whole similar to the original, though not without caveats.If you step away from the rather nonsensical ""git gud"" and ""HARDEST GAME EVA!"" style of buzzwording and advertising spiel focusing on Dark Souls' difficulty curve, an element I'm not going to plunge into too much as it has been focused on to death in other places, possibly the main draw to the Souls series has been its world building and combat. The original Dark Souls had one of the greatest world designs I've possibly ever seen in games, where everything functioned as a coherent whole with some lovely trickery to catch out players. Dark Souls 2 however seemed to fluff this up rather badly both with giving the player the ability to warp between fires from the get-go and rather uninspired and illogical level design: Hello lava coved plateau accessed by climbing a tower.Dark Souls 3 thankfully takes some steps back to the more coherent visions of DS1. From the early area in the High Wall of Lothric you can see the majority of locations stretching off into the distance below the high city, as you can also see the locations stretching back up from the bottom, including a rather fantastic deep trench from a place called Irathil. The world is laid out in a coherent manner and, like the original Dark Souls, if you could see something far off not only does that mean you can most likely go there, but it also will be in a roughly correct geographical location. Despite this nice move back to the coherent whole world of DS1 warping between bonfires from the start returns. The levels themselves spiral around and shortcuts appear in a rather wonderful way similar to how DS1 worked, especially in The Cathedral of the Deep (a single bonfire covers most of this area, and its great) and the afore mentioned Irathil, however they all feel like self contained ""levels"" so to speak, where each area feels like a shrunken version of DS2's DLC areas. There are no moments where you take an elevator from Darkroot and suddenly find yourself in the Valley of the Drakes, or even the link between there, Blightown and New Londo. Despite this the actual design of each of these areas is so well executed I don't think it matters so much, with tricks and traps everywhere, and enemies that scream of ""this is impossible!"" before you learn the trick and navigate the areas with ease later.Connected with the world building is the story and lore. In this Dark Souls 3 is a fine return to form, that being if you can fathom out the story and its purposeful obtuseness. Like the previous Souls games DS3 delivers a narrative that is very much unique to video games: this would not function as a book or a film. Everything is obtuse, covered in mystery and is very rarely explained. Enemy placement, item placement, item descriptions and the scant bits of info salvaged from NPCs fills in the holes of the ""Go get these blokes, kill that other bloke and set yourself on fire"" the game seems to give. Again, I will not plumb these depths as there are some rather fantastic explorations into DS's lore on YouTube. Suffice to say that the background for Dark Souls 3 is a fitting end to the series, if I am indeed correct.Combat wise the game has taken a step back to DS1 with its controls. Parrying is not as random as DS2 as well as guard breaks and leap attacks are not as difficult. It retains the way that breaking guards opens people up to ripostes like DS2, and that is welcome, and essentially makes the general combat feel as satisfactory as ever, if a little faster in the wake of Bloodborne. Some elements have taken a step back such as the way weapons only buff in the manner they did in DS1, where a lot of weapons could not buff or whatnot and also duel wielding items cannot be power stanced. Slightly annoying but not crippling.My main complaints mainly stem from the rather buggy nature DS3 seems to have. Of the 3 games in the trilogy DS3 has given me the most problems, with mobs clipping through the world (and me at times) to multiplayer elements glitching out (cannot enter boss fogs) and at least 4 of the PvP convents just flat out not working. Maybe these will be fixed with patches (provided he does not kick people off ledges), but right now there are a multitude of issues which makes the game hard to recommend right now. Net code is also as weird as it has always been, causing some players to hit you from large distances while doing PvP or sometimes character models, both enemies and human players, to loose all animations and being incapable of attacking. By this point though if I have come to expect one goofy thing via From Soft games, its wonky net play.A slight other complaint may be the somewhat lazy elements of recycled elements in the game. The degree of fan service in the games from the prior titles is a bit grating. Some may enjoy it, but when a person wearing a very familiar set of armour appeared with the mannerisms of a DS1 character appeared I rolled my eyes. As it is, this is all dependent on how much you can tolerate this stuff.At the end of the day I find it hard not to recommend DS3. It is the most polished and well thought out game in the series from a design stand point, though is slightly glitchy and buggy in spots. I still do not think it is as good as DS1, but it is leagues ahead of DS2. In this regard I imagine this may be remembered in a similar manner to how Final Fantasy IX was: FFVII was the classic everyone remembers, FFVIII was the awkward follow up and FFIX was the classic that ended up being the polished finality to that era, though ended up overlooked mainly due to the fact it was not FFVII. Give it a shot, it will certainly be worth it.",1
Positive,I died. Many times. Even Chuck Norris cannot beat this game without dying.Best game of all time.,1
Positive,"I have played all DS games and bloodborne (all on console). This game is EVERYTHING that DS2 should have been. The leveldesign from DS1 is back with ladders and connections between levels, and the whole feeling, atmosphere & lore of the game is much more in line with DS1. You basically get an improved DS1 with the bloodborne gfx-engine which looks beautiful on PC. I run it with a PS4 controller on 1080p maxed out and it has been amazing so far. 15 hours in. One big difference with the previous games is that the way/road to the bosses are tougher, but the bosses themselves seem to be a little bit easier overall. But overall, a harder journey since 90% of the gameplay is tougher. I LIKE IT!",1

Positive,"Dark souls 3 feels like a love letter to the community and fans who have played and been a part of this trilogy. It brings an epic conclusion to this intricate yet beautiful world of Dark Souls. The game has one of the strongest roaster of main bosses in the series. The bosses are challenging but very well balanced. Personally I felt the game is a bit easier as compared to the others in the series and that is because the game rewards the players who figure out and get used to the patterns and the mechanics the game has to offer. The game takes good amount of influence from Bloodborne, be it the faster combat or spooky areas with somewhat spooky enemies or lot of howling and shouting here and there etc. The game also has some really heart warming throwbacks to the OG Dark Souls and I loved how they picked up few interesting mechanics from DS2 as well. For me a really important aspect I look forward to in a souls game is the exploration bit. Going through the world, exploring secrets, finding shortcuts etc. This aspect in DS3 was somewhat weaker for me. Now there are secrets to uncover and shortcuts to find but the world felt a bit bland in terms of variety and it looks less vibrant. Having said that, I do understand that world is designed keeping in mind the context of the story and definitely the overall visual storytelling is very strong. The themes of decay and stagnation and very well depicted. An amazing game overall. PS: The DLCs are truly epic with some really memorable boss encounters. Ringed city is peak Dark Souls.",1

Positive,"Hello! This is my review of Dark Souls 3. I have to say, this game has so many amazing aspects to it. The sound quality is top-notch, the story is rich in depth, and hidden lore adds layers throughout the game. Overall, I'd highly recommend it because there's a plethora of activities to dive into across its diverse areas, offering plenty of exploration opportunities.The gameplay is incredibly smooth, and the controls are reminiscent of the previous games, which enhances the overall experience. For me, Dark Souls 3 was fantastic, offering more content than its predecessors. The bosses are notably more challenging, making it the toughest Souls game I've played.The armor sets and weapons are exceptionally well-designed, surpassing even those in Dark Souls 1 & 2. The music and cutscenes are immersive and beautiful, adding depth to the experience. The detailed lore adds another layer, making it a must-play for fans of the series.Dark Souls 3 expands upon its predecessor and offers a continuation of the story, regardless of the ending chosen in Dark Souls 1. The locations are captivating, and it's especially exciting to see areas from the first game reintroduced. If you're a fan of Dark Souls or any FromSoftware RPGs, you're bound to love it. - Rikka :D Extremely Great Boss Fights. Great Combat, A lot of weapons to use. Amazing Soundtrack and good sound quality. Outstanding story and lore. AI & NPCS are improved from the older games.",1

Positive,Dark souls and any game made by from software are the best games made in the modern era. My children will be playing every game made by them in time. These games and their story are equal in value to the highest valued art.,1
Positive,"I am in this game, this pleases me greatly. Iron Tarkus shall live on.",1
Positive,"Overall, the community is easy going and the players are kind to one another. You will find yourself being helped throughout the game with powerful npc s and fair mechanics. Other players will also be available to summon and will protect you from harm. This is a game for people who want to take it easy and enjoy themselves. One might say that the land is peaceful, its inhabitants kind.With that being said, be sure to check out Dark Souls III if you enjoy games that:are easy to learndon t have steep learning curvestell you where to godon t screw you over with unfair 1-hit comboshave a story you don t have to find out on your own",1
Positive,"This game is amazing. It is great for both first timers and people returning to the series. And don't let the rumors put you off. The game isn't as hard as you think. And trust me, when you find yourself in the intricate dance that is one of the boss fights, you just might find your heart pounding as you roll through the bosses attacks and counter with one of your own. It is a rush that few games can make you feel.The gameplay is fast and tight. Mistakes can be made, but you will pay for each and every one of them. The world, scenery and music are the most beautiful in the series. More than once you will find yourself gazing at an incredible view. The bosses and enemies are well designed and a joy to fight. The story stands on its own, but it also has quite a few callbacks to the earlier games. I can only think of nice things to say about this game. It is a well designed, albeit sometimes frustrating game, with a world and gameplay that few other games can match. Do yourself a favor and try it sometime.",1
Positive,"Thank you Mr Miyazaki for this masterpiece.!Strong as should be the 3rd part of the series.Very good graphics compared to the prequels,Weapon art an option to mix your moves on the field.Laggy sometimes on the pvp.Very strong single player needs patience and preparation.Not too hard as the 1st one.Overall a great game setting the standards high.Great work from FromSoftware.",1
Positive,"By far one of my favourite games of all time. I originally had this on Xbox and upon getting a good PC I instantly bought the game and the game looks stunningly beautiful on high settings. The game is well created, all the areas connect together fluently and the combat system is great. In conclusion, I believe that this game is definitely worth the expensive cost and is well worth the play.",1
Positive,"Dark Souls III is currently the latest game in the Dark Souls series. If this is your first Dark Souls game, you need to know that Dark Souls is well-known for its extremely hard difficulty, frustrating deaths, and slow grinding progress (because you'll lose everything if you fail to retrieve your dropped souls - or 'money'). In short, it's just completely merciless to the player. If you're a hardcore gamer that loves challenges, I heavily recommend this for you. Dark Souls is the type of game where the difficulty overwhelms the fun, so if you're a casual gamer looking to rekt some AIs easily and be a hero that saves the universe - don't buy this game. Know that your character will die a lot in this game. I mean, A LOT. So if you're the type of person that crushes things around you when you're frustrated, I also don't recommend this game for you to save your stuff.GameplayYou'll start with creating your character and choosing a class. And then, the slaughtering will start. Arguably overpowered enemies - usually in the form of monsters - will start popping out as you progress through the map and you'll gain 'souls' when you defeat them. You can spend your collected souls as soon as you find some kind of a 'checkpoint', usually in the form of a large area that consists of a blacksmith, a store, a bonfire (respawn point), and an NPC to upgrade your stats. You'll get to purchase weapons, armors, power-ups, stats, etc. in these checkpoints to give you a better fighting chance against the enemies. Each time you die, you'll drop ALL of your collected souls and you'll have to retrieve it the next time you respawn. If you die again, then you'll not be able to retrieve the souls you collected the first time you died. Only the last pack of souls will be dropped and retrievable. When you successfully dominates an 'area', you'll have to beat a boss fight to gain access to the next 'area'. Usually, the bosses are extremely overpowered and it'll take more than 10 retries to beat them. This is basically what you'll do the whole game. Walk - kill enemies - die - grind souls - die - purchase stuff - fight bosses - die - repeat.AdvantagesGraphics are way better than Dark Souls II. It's really nice to look at and overall, it's great. The main advantage of the game is the difficulty. Some of you, like me, may think ""What? Who finds getting killed over and over again, getting frustrated, punching stuff around you, or even throwing your CPU out of the window because you are p*ssed off as 'fun'?"". Well, people have different ideas of 'fun'. There are hundreds of thousands or even millions of players that loves the Dark Souls franchise. The overwhelming difficulty is what makes Dark Souls unique. Its PS4-only cousin, Bloodborne, also gained huge attention from gamers due to similar gameplay style. I personally don't find getting killed over and over again or fighting against overpowered enemies as 'fun' but I find the game greatly trains my mentality - it desensitized me from failure, which will be important in my pursue of success. But know this: this game is not all about death and failures. You'll learn how to fight with your brain instead of blindly slashing everywhere. Yes, Dark Souls is skill-based. You'll have to get used on using the roll, heavy slash, light slash, shields, bows, utiliteies, etc. if you want to be able to progress through the game. They are not easy at all to master.DisadvantagesStoryline is confusing. It's best not to put your hope on the story-driven part. The game lacks explanation about the previous installment stories. You can always look at YouTube to catch up with the stories but IMHO, it's not a nicely written story. It's short, lacks details, lacks plot twists, and it's just way too 'mainstream and predictable'. As for the soundtrack, it's empty as usual. I expected epic songs for these kinds of games but apparently, they still think almost-no-soundtracks is good. The overwhelming difficulty itself is NOT a disdvantage - it is purely based on your gaming style preference. The second noticable disadvantage is the lack of new weapons in the shops. I may not have progressed far but when I meet a 'checkpoint', I couldn't find anything useful in there. I might have to enchant weapons and all but I haven't quite understood the mechanism. Should it be a disadvantage? I don't know. I might be too stupid to understand the whole mechanism in 5 hours or maybe the game itself lacks tutorials for new players that are not familiar with Dark Souls.Final VerdictIt all depends on your gaming preference. Some people enjoy Dark Souls, some people don't. Make sure you look at the gameplay first on YouTube or whatever before purchasing this game just to make sure you won't waste your money. I personally like this game and recommend it for everyone regardless of your gaming preference because everyone needs to be desensitized from failures. But you might think it's not necessary because you already have a super safe life and a tremendous amount of parent's money. Just make sure you watch the gameplay first before purchasing it.",1

If only the game had dedicated servers for pvp it would be perfect.,1
Positive,"Great game, very challenging at first but once you get hang of it, it becomes quite satisfying to outmaneuver bosses and any other NPC that's like a mini boss.It took me under 50 hours to beat the game but that's with whole exploring aspect, i really took time to explore each corner and find whatever i could stumble across around each corner. If you don't care about that, you could manage it way faster, as i even beat optional bosses but that for me is a big bonus and which i really liked about this game as this has so much variety. More stuff to do, more fun. There's still things i missed during my playthrough, which i have to go and finish that before i'll go into my Journey 2 game.About the story side, i still really don't know what it was about even though i beat the game, only some parts. Maybe it's because i haven't played DS1 and DS2? Don't know but all the cinematic i got from the game, even though it was very small portion, it still was really nice. It's not the story that got me interested anyway, but the gameplay.Overall, if you looking to buy this. You won't regret it, i didn't even notice hours pass by while playing this game. Even when i was irritated by losing over and over again, i was still always looking forward to advance to the next boss.",1
Positive,"Dark Souls 3 is my first Dark Souls (I have commited a sin for not playing the others I'm sorry)You will feel pain, you will cry, you will suffer, every time you die.The game has great combat and punishes you for your errors.

It also has a very unique atmosphere I've ever seen in games before and it's cool. The characters, the creatures you encounter, the boss fights, soundtrack,etc. It's a phenomenal game and to me I felt confident in playing through it after defeating the 1st boss. It just gives you satisfaction defeating large enemies for souls.I would definitely reccommend Dark Souls III whether you are a veteran (you probably have it already anyway) or new to the series like me.",1
Positive,An incredible game start to finish - an extremley worthy successor to Dark Souls. Highly Reccomended.,1

Positive,"Well, well, well.I never loved this game before.I just wanted to buy a co-op game with my buddy, and he told me that this game will be a good choice.I said ""ok why not"".After a few hour, i felt i need to play more with this game. After a 10-15 hour, i felt that i need to complete this game.After i completed the game, i felt i need to complete this game again, and locate all the secrets and lore.After i completed the game twice, i felt that i need to buy the dlc's coz i didnt get enough from this game(from the positive side ofc).After this monologe you can realize that how much i love this game now.Just to be fair!Positive thing:- Wonderful graphics- Nice combat system- So many different enemies with different combat style- Epic boss battle's- Good lore- Great co-op experience (even if the co-op system is not working at all the time for me)- Very-very good rpg system- Beutiful musicThere is no negative. Maybe the only one, that you getting brain cancer sometimes, but thats it.Go fucking buy it!",1
Positive,"Dark Souls 3 is by far my favorite installment of the Dark Souls universe. Dark Souls 1 is obviously the pioneer of the saga and is the sole reason the series was a wild success(which is why it should have been remade like Demon Souls was instead of ""remastered""). Dark Souls 2 was the experimental aspect of the series allowing for more creative choices to be made with a rich world to explore. Ultimately it deviated too far from the nucleus of the Souls-Verse/game. However, Dark Souls 3 returns back to the roots of the first game (albeit with some alterations) while learning from the shortfalls of Dark Souls 2. What Dark Souls 3 becomes is arguably the best Dark Souls game for a multitude of reasons but mainly: story/lore/themes, gameplay (both single-player and pvp), and level design. In fact I would say that Dark Souls 3 is the best installment to ease new players into the series as it is more streamlined from all the learned lessons from From Software. Which is why I suggest a machete order to be 3,1,2. 3 eases them into the series, 1 punishes them/shows them their roots, 2 allows for more exploration of the universe. All of these games are great in their own right.",1
Positive,This has become by far my favorite game. The joy of finally killing a boss after countless tries is the greatest <3,1
Positive,Dark souls III optimization killer detected editionNote that dont buy this game with gt635m or 900m series9/10,1
Positive,Hands down best game ever.,1
Positive,"I've played through the trilogy two times before and this is my third time going through Dark Souls III. Everytime I replay, I learn something new, see something new and I get as excited every single time. This is a beautiful game with a big dark world to explore. I would highly recommend buying the whole trilogy and going through them from the start if this is your first time.Dark Souls is an immersive feeling than will take you on the journey of your life, filled with choices, challenges and rage.",1
Positive,"Dark Souls is back! From the initial cutscene you can just feel that it's gonna be more like Dark Souls and less like Dark Souls 2, which is a fantastic thing. It's faster than any Souls game before it, but not quite as fast as Bloodborne, making it it's own unique beast. The graphics are stunning and the game runs like an absolute dream on my machine, although I've heard a few people are experiencing crashes, so take my experience with a grain of salt. To me, it's 50% Dark Souls, 20% Bloodborne, 20% Demon's Souls and 10% Dark Souls 2. If that's how you'd rank the Souls Series, then you should definitely get Dark Souls 3, assuming you haven't already.",1
Positive,"I'm going to start and say, I love Demon's Souls, Dark Souls, and even Bloodborne. I recommend this game, I do.But this review addresses everything wrong with the game as a sequel. This is a review for fellow Souls fans.Dark Souls 3 is, straight up, the easiest Souls game created. Anyone can beat it. Even the most inept of players won't hit a wall, they'll eventually tear through it. The difficulty of this game pales in comparison to Demon's Souls, to Dark Souls, to Dark Souls 2, and to Bloodborne by a massive amount. It's possible even some casual players will find themselves never losing their souls to a second death.Many enemies, from across the series, come up as a huge wall to players. You learn their movements, and tear through them after putting in the time and work. Trying to work around them can even end in great disaster. The only enemy that really puts up a fight can be the Lotrhic Knights, but not because of their difficulty, because of their damage and that is all. They are defeated without effort: spamming light attacks will keep them staggered. And after that, there are no more hard enemies. Not one in the game. You are set on by nothing but hollows who sluggishly move, and the very rare semi-competent skeletons. Anything much harder. is solved by a gimmick.A giant worm that would otherwise be a horrible fight can be killed using a giant ballista. One of the bosses has a weapon specifically for him to kill him fairly quickly, much like the Storm Ruler from Demon's Souls. The hardest bosses (The Dancer, Champion Gundyr) are dispatched with not even well timed rolling and a few hits to their backside.But worse than that, the levels are not just short, but there's very few. and most are very, very bland. While Dark Souls 1 was applauded for having a fantastically designed map, all of it interconnected and much of it unique, Dark Souls 2 was somewhat more traditional though still had some connections but was given far more unique locations, such as mining operations, a lava flooded castle, a castle drowned in rain, a quiet lake littered with fireflies and glowing fauna, dark labs, dragon's nests, and then the DLC areas were astounding. Dark Souls 3 is purely linear and only about half the total size of Dark Souls 2, every area was more bland. A somewhat interesting cemetery, a bland not-so-special castle aside from hollows who could only half way become pilgrim butterflies, bland forest with set pieces from DS1 for nostalgia, dull catacombs, a completely dull poison swamp, a lousy prison, a boring revist of Oolacile, a mostly uninteresting library. The most interesting areas of Dark Souls 3 are far from unique, capturing very little of the creativity of DS1 and DS2 with areas like Blighttown, the Painted World of Ariamas, New Londo Ruins, The Gutter, Majula, Shrine of Amana, Dark Chasm of Old, Brume Tower, Eleum Loyce. This isn't even half of the unique locales that were indeed quite enjoyable to look at, and the most unique location Dark Souls 3 has to offer is Kiln of the First Flame, an area that takes all of fifteen seconds to cross.And part of the world is the characters. While Greirat and Siegward are at least nice to talk to, everyone else is all but forgettable, and you rarely see them still. You don't talk to and regret meeting Lautrec, you don't feel as if you're following along on a grand journey like you did with Solaire (though you do stumble into Siegward just like before), you don't meet a character who asks you to kill -everyone- else, you don't meet some old king who tells you all of his regrets. You just meet people who are interested in selling stuff to you, and the obligatory Patches encounter.And then there's weapon balance. Much like other games, some weapons are better than others, but this time around, some weapons are leagues better than others compounded by the fact Poise is purely a disabled stat this time around (read again if you need to, Poise does nothing in Dark Souls 3 and has been confirmed as intentional). The Dark Sword, for instance, is a low weight of 4.5, and does a damage per second that completely outclasses nearly every weapon in the game with the correct build. The Spiked Mace can be built in a way that it will one shot players without any sort of parry. And Tower Shields are practically impossible to counter in PvP, and can attack while blocking far more effectively than a spear and shield torgether would be.On top of the poor weapon balance and Poise removed, invading players are at an extreme disadvantage: with reduced health, halved Estus rounded down, and primarily only invading players with phantoms, each invasion results in one of a few ways: the invader gets greedy and goes to them, and gets stuck fighting two players at once, the invader sits and waits by monsters for the next half hour because the host is too afraid for the odds to be evened despite still having more Estus, the invader finds a gank squad just for killing players already at a disadvantage, or the host doesn't know what they're doing and just runs out wildly and gets himself killed not even by you but some accident or monster.Or, if you're particularly unlucky, you'll run into a hacker. They take far less damage than they should at their level? They're modded their stats to be much higher without raising their level. They kill you in one hit? A hacker. There is even the ability to turn completely invisible, or fly, alter weapons to work how they want. This is nothing new to Souls, oh no. In DS1, hackers had the ability to instantly curse others with one hit of their weapon, even crash their game or rapid fire Firebombs. This time around, hackers can actually hit you with something that rapidly gives you souls and gets you, the invader, or even the host, banned out of nowhere. The solution to this: manual save backups because there are no cloud saves. The only solution currently. And the hacker problem is much worse than DS2, as Soul Memory made it hard to peg down for hackers where to be in that total to appropriately fuck over others. but could get banned if they had more souls than soul memory as a counter.In short: Dark Souls 3 is the worst game of the Souls series. While people ripped on DS2 for a long time being worse than DS1, DS3 is worse than DS2 by a long shot in size, balance, quality of level design, PvP, and most importantly, difficulty.It's just too damn easy.",1
Positive,"Three hours in, already rage quit, I'll come back after I've calmed down and a bottle of tequila. 11/10",1
Positive,"I spent my time playing the game and forgot to review it. Welp.For non-fans: If you want to get into the souls games, this isn't a bad place to start, as much as I'd like to say start with Demon's Souls or Dark Souls. Dark Souls 3 is a more accessible title and if you think it's your jam in the first two hours, it's probably going to be your jam for the next 300 hours. So, I am a longtime Souls fan. I love these games more than I should. I love the lore, the world-building, the combat, the ambience, the chracters, the story delivery, the bosses, etc. My opinion is biased. However, maybe not the way it would seem. On the first week of release, I f**king Hated this game. It was boring, easy, and the lore was redundant, or so it seemed. I was obviously awstruck by some events. (I would name them but fans who've yet to play this one will kill me.however, at this point, what souls nerd hasn't played 3?) It took about a month long break after my second time beating it for me to really appreciate it. The first time was on ps4 in which some bosses seemed to have the awesome ability of tanking your framerate. I did complete it, though. Then again on pc. I had hoped it would spark an interest but it didn't. And then I started connecting the game with the previous game(s) (honestly, just DkS 1 because Miyazaki seems to want to forget DkS 2) and then, only then, did my love respark. The Gameplay: It's basically the same as Dark Souls but with omni-directional rolling and weapon arts that diversify your movesets and increase the already skyscraper level skill cap. I don't have any complaints.The Bosses: So, I am biased here. Dark Souls was a game basically about you killing gods. It was so satisfying. In Dark Souls 3, you're killing lords; previous kindlers of the flame. The whole idea is awesome but it does show in the scale of some of the boss fights. Some are far easier than I would like. Luckily, From noticed this and have since then upped the HP of some of the fights to make them feel more challenging or to elongate some very fun fights. (The Dancer needed it and I love her again) Favorite in the game; Pontiff Sulyvahn/ Nameless King. Level Design: Some areas are just fantastically designed. Some stand-outs for me are Lothric Castle, the ever amazing Untended Graves and The-Place-That-Shan't-Be-Named because it's so f**king cool to get there. Unfortunately, there are places that just aren't nearly as interesting such as the Crucifixion Woods and Farron Keep. The game as a whole never quite reaches Bloodborne levels of wonderful level design but it gets quite close. The areas don't diversify in as much of an interesting way as they did in Dark Souls but far more than Bloodborne. The Lore: Wonderful. If you were a fan of Dark Souls lore, you will love digging into DkS 3's lore. Conclusion: It doesn't feel as special as Dark Souls at times but you have to take it as a place in the series. It does well to be the true successor to Dark Souls. It really is the Dark Souls II that we (mainly me) truly were hoping for.",1
Positive,"This game is having me hooked, i was a huge DS1 fan with alot of play thrus and DS3 is definetly amazing aswell. I bought it 4 weeks ago and have almost 100 hours already.",1
Positive,"Oh Dark Souls 3, you are generally a joy to play. The mechanics are good. Punishing you for playing poorly and rewarding you for playing well. The difficulty scaling is decent (Despite the DLC making the final boss feel like a victory lap). And the DLC itself is very fun! I had so many moments going through the game where it surprised me, in both good and ""bad"" ways. Now onto the Pros and Cons:Things Dark Souls 3 Got Right:Just difficult enoughBoss VarietyEnemy VarietyMap Zone VarietyTeleportation To Any BondfireInteresting NPCs and Unique Quest-linesSecret BossesSecret Covenants Easy Co-Op Password (Joining a friend is extremely easy in this game, as it should be)Things I wish were in Dark Souls 3:More weapons for each weapon type (I played majority of the game with a scythe, but there weren't many scythes to choose from)Secret Boss Weapons (Tail Weapons/Limb Weapons)DS2's NG+ Bond Fire Mechanic (Its one of the few things DS2 did right)Make certain NPCs easier to find, I very easily ran past a few of them (very minor gripe)Armor with unique mechanics/effects and variety in stats. (DS3 feels somewhat fashion souls-y)Final Boss Scaling in accordance with completion of the DLC (After the DLC bosses, the ""Final"" Boss was slapped down within 2-3 minutes, maybe even less.)Most of the gripes I have with DS3 can be summed up with me saying ""Man this game is great but I would love more [BLANK]"". With that being said, I'm somewhat sad to have gotten through Dark Souls 3 as quickly as I have (it could be related to running through all of the FromSoft games back to back). However, NG+ is also a part of DS3 that I know I'll be doing for another play-through.If this is your first Souls game, I would highly recommend it! It is fun, accessible, and polished. If you are a fan of the Souls series already, this game is a large improvement over DS2, and a great send off for Dark Souls!",1

The new game launches so then they kill the servers and say ""we love our souls community, we will have the servers back ASAP."" Now passing 2 months and the online servers are still down. I love fromsoft games but this really put bad rep on them I can't recommend this game till they fix the issue with online.*UPDATE*Online is back up the game gets put back on the good list with me.",1
Positive,"[Do Mind my English iz badzor]9/10 , I would rate this game 10/10 if it wasn't for the PC issue Me and others players having issue with.The game is fantastic, better that DS1/DS2 IMHO. At first I thought this game will be just like DS2, I look at the trailer and I saw the graphic doesn't seem improve from DS2 (yes i like seeing Graphic lel) but that was just my eyes problem, after I take alook again, It remind me of Bloodborn. Maybe DS3 inspired from bloodborn? who knows but I'am happy with new animation and new graphic looking :DThe gameplay is amazingly done, I don't have any problem so far with the battle mechanic like bugs.Now let's talk about the issues that me and other PC user having problem with. For some reason I cannot turn everything max setting (my PC can handle ultra setting for GTA5 and other games I have on steam and non steam such as BF4, Star Wars battlefront etc) So its Impossible for me not to run this game max setting. I had to turn off Lighting and motion blur. Everytime I turn my lighting on, my game would freeze, most of the time it will crashed my pc! GG!But after you turn down your lighting setting to Low, It should fixed the crashing. I'am not sure with other PC user, they say they crashed when they were nearby first bonfire, some crashed at start up. Bandai/Software give us patch NOW! So far the game succesfully makes me angry with few bosses and MINI Bosses! dafuq xD. For me, this game is harder than DS1/DS2. Do I recomend to buy this game? yup! GIVE EM MONEH! lol jk but yeah I enjoyed alot!",1
Positive,"Dark Souls III is the third title of the Dark Souls trilogy, it is as well made as the previous ones, while also enhancing a lot of aspects from the series. It maintains the dark gothic fantasy thematics which encompass the whole soulslike concept and it actually incorporates that more deeply in the storyline and the appearance of the characters and regions. The combat mechanics are the same with the rest of the soulslike titles, the regions are well designed and have become easier to navigate, while the teleportation system with the bonfires is also more friendly. The customization has also been expanded, with more hairstyles and other details. One unique aspect of Dark Souls 3 which makes it special is the iconic Fire Keeper maiden with the silver hair which became kind of a cultural icon and also one of the main symbols of the soulslike concept, as she is imagined to be awaiting in the bonfire and works as the guidance.",1
Positive,honestly i almost never bought this but im glad i did worth every penny. the community is very nice too suprisingly,1
Positive,"Easier than previous games(probably because i'm acustommed to it by now), PvP needs some fine tuning, best covenants ever, great design and sound, probably the best story out of all 3.",1
Positive,"9/10The good:no more Soul Memory from DS2 and the game follows the Soul Level system from DS1;multiplayer matching is seamless and now incorporates weapon upgrade tiers;closure to the many memorable characters from DS1; (Yes, this includes Gwyn's First Born)most of the maps are well designed. A few do feel like it's dragging the game on but luckily they ain't big maps;music, environment and atmosphere are wonderful as usual;four different endings (be sure to check out the secret ending as it's probably the canon one);you can respec your characters up to five times per playthrough;four ring slots (upgraded from two ring slots in previous entries).The bad:ranking up Covenants feel like grinding. Some of them are actually faster to grind offline. The Rank 2 Covenant rewards are pretty niche. You might still want to level up your Covenants for achievement;Luck stat seems like an after thought;Faith build is a bit OP but you can prepare for it;each boss has some weakness you can exploit (which is fine). But some bosses (including the DLC bosses) could die ridiculously easy if you exploit their weakness in a certain way;The ugly:bugs. Sometimes you can't enter fog door as helper phantom;final boss to Soul series. It's fitting but it's not to everyone's liking. YMMV;spell casting in general is not as good as melee. Consider mixing some melee into your mage build;ganking, hackers, etc;what happens to Dragon Form?Bottom line:as at the time of the writing, you can probably buy the game with DLC for $15-20. The content is well worth the price;if you are new to Soul series, it may actually not such a bad idea to play DS3 as your first Soul game. If you do, consider DS1 to be the prequel. This way you will appreciate DS3 more. There are a few ties in to DS2 but you can always read about them;I still rank DS1 higher than DS3, but DS3 is definitely the more polished game.",1
Positive,It's a pretty good game to try.,1
Positive,"Dark Souls at it's finest.This is the best game From Software has put out to date. They've improved the mechanics from the other Souls games to create a more fluid, visceral combat by taking pages out of their Bloodborne playbook. The level design and locales are better designed than ever before. There's a lot less ""artificial difficulty"" in this game when compared to previous games. Almost everything in the game can be countered with skill, even if unexpected. Not nearly as many treacherous ledges, or enemies hiding somewhere you cannot see them no matter how much you turn the camera, while they wait to strike and one-shot you. Don't get me wrong, these things still happen. Just not as much. Art direction is superb, and the atmosphere is wonderful. I really like the boss fights as well. Not many gimmick fights. Just one, really. Cons for this game are pretty limited. Camera does the player a disservice in some instances, but it's probably intentional. Music is not nearly as engaging as previous entries, but I suppose that's not necessarily a bad thing to some, even if it all sounds relatively alike. The plot is still mostly non-existant, and hidden behind a few sentences on some items that you may or may not find as you progress. It's taken three full games (two really, since they mostly ignore DS2) to build up to a half-formed idea of a story. What's there is pretty cool, but even with what's given crafting some idea of the story will only lead you with half answers or ideas, and you're often left filling in blanks with whatever you come up with in your head. On PC, the online is bad. There are a lot of cheaters out there now. Wasn't the case when I started playing, but it's only getting worse, so beware. Honestly though, I feel like those complaints aren't really a big deal, outside of the MP. The story is very obviously an afterthought, as it's not a story driven game. The camera doesn't bug me so much because it's pretty rare for it to really get bad, and these games are mostly trial and error anyway. The music I had to listen to after I played the game on the soundtrack, because I was so engrossed in the experience I couldn't even think of the tunes. It's a very finely crafted game, and I think everyone should give it a go, and not be discouraged by dying here and there.It earns a very hearty recommendation from me.",1
Positive,"""Potentially the best game I've ever played, however I can't bring myself to leave a positive review until FromSoftware brings back the multiplayer. There is no excuse for it to have been down for this long."" That was my original review. FromSoft has since fixed the multiplayer; I stand by my statement that Dark Souls 3 is potentially the best game I've ever played. Buy this game.",1
Positive,It's probably the best game ever made tbh,1
Positive,"The game seems to be a little bit easier unlike to the classic Dark Souls 1 & 2. The optimalisation is good comparing other PC tittles. I haven't got any crucial FPS drop. Expect from one location when you light the bonfire and game may crush :(In Dark Souls 3 developers finally fixed mouse and keyboard controls. You are able to play without using controller. Game maybe annoying in some stages but it's normal. Take into account a lot of deaths, frustration moments, boss stucks, broken peripherals :) and patience of course. Music and graphic are flawless, specially graphic has been improved.",1
Positive,"My first game of this awesome title, my friends said the first game is harder than the other, but i didnt try yet!So as a noob, i dare to say that this game is absolutly hard, i spent 4 hours soloing the dancer (those who played will know!), this is a challenge, for real, to everyone, even for those who likes these genre.I lost my insanity playing, trying and achieved 100% of the game.This game defines who are the man among the kids.",1
Positive,"Took me 26 Hours, making it the shortest souls game so far. Even though the actual graphics aren't that impressive, the atmoshere still is hella amazing. (Environmental spoilers)http://imgur.com/a/hP6U5The bossfights were mostly really well done and definitely harder than in DSII and BB. Whereas i've beaten the majority of bosses first try in those two, it took me an average of 3 tries per boss in DSIII. The hardest one was King of the Storm.Generally, the bossfights had some really cool ideas, even if a handful weren't that well executed. The designs themselfs are all amazing tho. I thought the environments were a bit too samey for the most part but coming back to Anor Londo was really cool. The leveldesign seemed to be a bit more linear than the other games (Altho souls games never have been truly open natured), Soundtrack was top notch too. I hope that it is really going to be the last Dark Souls game, after three (or rather four if you count DeS), i'm a bit sick of the middleage setting. There is just so much you can do with it.",1

Positive,One of the greatest game experiences beating this game. Already have it on a different console but still bought it on pc and it still feels as good as the first time playing it. The confusing and mysterious story and lore is incredible. Definitely buy this and the other Soulsborne games if you get the chance.,1
Positive,"I already had this game on Xbox and played through it already. But I bought this version too, so that I could play this with my PCbros. Then the servers got shut downEdit:Fromsoft must have sympathized with my tragic story because a week after I posted this (half a year after the servers were shut down) the servers were reopened.Good game you can play multiplayer in it 10/10",1
Positive,"On my first playthrough, I had some reservations. It speaks to the vision and depth of Dark Souls III that on subsequent playthroughs, those reservations largely faded away. A game of rare ambition that manages to tie together all the previous Souls games - as well as Bloodborne - without compromising the breadth of its experience or dulling the deep satisfaction found in mastery of its mechanics. It is a fantastic experience, and the most impressively designed game I have ever played.",1
Positive,"First I'll say that Dark Souls franchise is one of the greatest thing ever happened to me. Now let's review. Yes the game is challenging at some times but not nearly as the ""game journalists"" portrays as. THE GAME IS FAIR. Combat, level design, graphics, music are great. Combat is based on block, dodge, light/heavey attack and magic. DS has multiple charecter classes with each having correspondence attributes that you can change few times. Dark Souls III has the best boss design after Dark souls I. DS always had the grim, dark, medival theme which I always liked. If you've come here for a walking or button smashing simulator this game is not for you. You have to explore, fight and earn your own shit for yourself.DS franchise has a very subtle way of story telling and from the lore perspective this game is second to none. This game has the best looking armor sets and wepons. Every weapon has some special move set that requires certain attributes.Invading and duel is half the fun of DS. Few of the npc will give you side quest and these quests are not like ""do it later"" quests. These had to be done in a cartain way to get certain things/ending.And finally Thank you Dark Souls.Praise the sun and remember ""Try tounge but hole""",1
Positive,"Dark Souls III is an Action RPG developed by From Software and published by Bandai Namco. I have played Both Dark Souls: Prepare to Die Edition and Dark Souls II: Sins of the First Scholar and have posted reviews of those too. This review is coming from a fan of the Dark Souls games. Again, like the previous games a controller is preferred. Keyboard/mouse controls in these games is a mess. Be warned, a lot of people using Nvidia cards have had problems with crashes and framerate, check the discussion topics if you have those issues. There's a couple of new starting classes this time and the Pyromancer is back! There are starting gifts to choose from and most of them are useless, there's no awesome master key like in the first game. I'd recommend starting with a Fire Gem for early fire weapon enchantment, Sovereignless soul for an easy 2000 souls or a rusted coin for better loot drops early on. It keeps the same bonfire rules as the first game, monsters will not despawn if you kill them too many times and they will always come back when resting at a bonfire (with the exception of some elite enemies). A huge step up in this game is the main Hub, Firelink Shrine. This is a place you will want to go back and visit often to talk to new NPCs, purchase goods from vendors and more importantly, level up. Progression seems balanced, the bosses feel just right for their point in time in the game and not unfair. If you get frustrated you can use an Ember, which is this game's version of Humanity and Effigy, to go online and summon phantoms to help you.Some more new things are spell charges have been swapped out in favor of a magic point (Focus Point) system which can be increased by leveling up Attunement. Gone is the agility stat from Dark Souls 2 and now we get a Luck stat that increases item discovery from slain enemies. Combat itself is a lot faster than previous Souls entries and dodge rolling must be mastered to survive, blocking and Poise do not help that much in this game unless you have extremely high levels of stamina or poise. Each weapon and shield now has a special weapon skill that uses Focus Points. Magic is also not as powerful as it used to be and now plays more of a supportive or supplemental role. You're allowed to change your appearance and respec your stats 5 times per playthrough. Once you join a covenant you can select to be in it by equipping its' symbol via equipment menu.My only complaints is the lackluster color palette and the world is very linear (although each area is huge). Bonfires feel more like checkpoints rather than a well earned respite like in Dark Souls 1 . I'm not huge into PvP so I don't have much to say about that. This is my 2nd favorite souls game right now with DS1 being 1st and DS2 being a distant 3rd. If you're familiar with the Souls games but on the fence about getting this one, I say go for it. But be prepared to die a lot, that hasn't changed.",1

It has an amazing replayability value akin to all souls games (and bloodborne to a lesser extent), combat is nice and fluid, and atmosphere is stunning. As with all games, there are a few flaws (if you can call them that). I'm under the impression that most games aren't stupid hard, the gamer is just trash, and this game is a perfect example of that. The first boss is a good intro to the game. He says, ""Shields don't do shit to me, so learn to dodge my attacks or get rekt."". This new combat system heavily encourages dodging over turtling (sorry for shield/spear builds), which may turn some people away. Parrying, as it's always been, is a massive risk/reward. If you nail that parry, you pretty much get a one shot kill. If you miss, all your stamina is gone and lots of chip damage goes through. Enemy placements and bonfire locations can be pretty unforgiving, (not on the level of ds2), but with the proper path and the right timing, it's a cakewalk. I don't play much pvp so I can't critique it, (mainly because i'm a scrub and suck at it), but i've heard it's pretty nice, especially the fight clubs outside pontiff's bonfire. Overall, the game is MUCH more fast-paced when compared to previous titles, especially the boss fights. Strength, Dexterity, and Quality builds are very good and very plentiful with lots of good scaling weapons, magic (sorcery, pyromancy) shreds through enemies but is relatively useless in pvp, miracle builds are useless for pvp but can be a massive relief off of the pve player's shoulders, and to top it all off for magic users, spells are much easier to achieve. Find the merchant, give them a book, and bam, tier 2 spells. Timing is EVERYTHING in this game. Mess up once, and you are a goner, not so much early-game, but absolutely in late-game, just like in Sekiro, From's newest title. This forces you to play strategically, figuring out the patterns of bosses, figuring out their weaknesses, exploiting those weaknesses, all while having a level of finesse; It makes the boss battles feel more like a elegant dance with swords. 10/10 would engage in jolly cooperation again.",1
Positive,"My name is Walter Hartwell White. I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. This is my confession. If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead, murdered by my brother-in-law Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, Hank came to me with a rather, shocking proposition. He asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using his connections in the drug world. Connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was. astounded, I. I always thought that Hank was a very moral man and I was. thrown, confused, but I was also particularly vulnerable at the time, something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me on a ride along, and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin so I agreed. Every day, I think back at that moment with regret. I quickly realized that I was in way over my head, and Hank had a partner, a man named Gustavo Fring, a businessman. Hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling out. From what I can gather, Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, to which Fring flatly refused to give him, and things escalated. Fring was able to arrange, uh I guess I guess you call it a ""hit"" on my brother-in-law, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured, and I wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge, working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring, and did so. In fact, the bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA, and about that time, to keep me in line, he took my children from me. For 3 months he kept them. My wife, who up until that point, had no idea of my criminal activities, was horrified to learn what I had done, why Hank had taken our children. We were scared. I was in Hell, I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, to end this nightmare, and in response, he gave me this. I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. I. All I could think to do was to make this video in hope that the world will finally see this man, for what he really is.",1

Positive,"Dark Souls III was my first FromSoftware experience and it was an amazing choice for a casual player like me who was looking for a challange. It's mechanics are easily understable, gameplay is challenging and fun. I recommend it to everyone who whants to start their Souls-like expirience!",1
Positive,"PROS:- Very fun to play, especially with the new engine which bring along a whole array of game mechanics- Functional crafting systems that is completely fleshed out and provides a feeling of satisfaction when upgrading your weapon so it kills beasties quicker!- Larger array of mobs than just humanoids, I felt that in dark souls II that most of the jobs were inevitably humanoid, if not with a slight twist, for example look at the mobs of the Shrine of Amana and Heides Tower of Flame for reference here- More NPCS! I love the stories of the NPCS and i feel it contributes to a more fleshed out game that is believable and I can immerse myself in.- Amazing Firelink Shrine, again i feel this is significantly better than Dark Souls 2 dispite not being attatched to the main world, very very similar to Demon Souls.- Plenty of weapons and armour sets to choose from, which makes reading all of the information linked with each item all the more funCONS:- Admintantly I have played around 17 hours as of writing this review, but Thus far I have only found 1 Illusory wall, dispite I feel like I have slapped every wall since the firelink shrine with a tree branch at least once.- Unfortunately I feel that a few attacks were unfair, such as having full tracking for attacks that should most definitely not have tracking (like jump attacks! gotta enjoy 90 degree pivots for a pancake attack, for a follow up, leaving a bad taste in my mouth and just a general feeling of dissapointment).- Elevator shortcuts, pls FromSoft why?! The first time is a shortcut, but I may need to oil the chain or something the amount of times I have died 15 seconds upon leaving that elevator, which I just spent 20 seconds waiting for.- I dislike the change made so that armour is no longer upgradable, it just doesnt sit well with me, but im not entirely sure why, maybe I just liked the option?- again as of this review I have only 17 hours in teh game and future patches may fix this, but I encounter some micro-stuttering in certain areas in the game, but this may be down to my personal rig, but I wouldnt say it isnt on the low end.- I also felt that the PVP was lacking response and hit detection, spears still on phantom range? I thought that was Dark Souls II material? as well as lacking response, almost comparable to attempting to punch smoke.OVERALL:I feel this is a very solid game that both veterans and Newcomers will enjoy, if not just for the outright adrenaline fueled fun from killing that annoying boss, and you most likely cant get that kick from many games on the market, however I feel that some of the bugs currently in the game (1.03) need to be slowly and methodically ironed out, leaving behind an amazing game that I would recommend to anyone to buy full price, you needent wait for that steam sale, this game is worth every penny, Enjoy and keep Soulsin' everyone!TLDR: Amazing game, as well as me personally having slight issue with some of the game, but overall worth every penny (or Cent?).",1
Positive,"Not having any of the crashing issues reported by others, Performance is fine with 60 fps even in the places people reported slow downs.Noticed the player count for this game was up to 120K+ So I'm not surprised a small minority are having issues as it's the nature of PC Gaming, No game is released perfect.A lot of people seem to be complaining about performance issues that are either using low end hardware or laptops because they are able to run Dark Souls II at silky smooth frame rates.Something to remember about this is Dark Souls II was built for and designed around the limitations of the hardware inside the PS3 and XBOX360. Dark Souls III was designed from the ground up to run on the current generation consoles the PS4 and XBOXONE, These consoles while still being under powered compared to a modest gaming desktop are still substantially more powerful than their predecessors and benefit from being static hardware making it easier to optimize for.But even so, BloodBorne and Dark Souls III both run at 30fps with drops down into the 20's on these consoles.So it shouldn't come as a shock to people that they can't run Dark Souls III at 60fps in MAX settings like they could in Dark Souls II with the same hardware. These games are a generation apart in terms of graphical power requirements.Dark Souls III uses much more complicated geometry,Better lighting effects, Higher texture resolution, Higher shadow resolution, Improved enemy AI and more.+Great graphics and art design, Attention to detail is as good as ever and really helps to captivate and immerse you into the gameplay. Mobs are also very detailed and feel like they belong in their respective area.+Some of the best boss designs/Fights of the series.+Amazing soundtrack, Boss music is epic.+Rewarding gameplay, Tougher and smarter mobs.+Seemingly infinite replayability from the sheer amount of equipment and build variety the game offers. Co-op gameplay and PVP with many covenants designed around it.+Possibility of 6 players total in online play.-Network lag and online hit detection needs some work.-Game kicks to the main menu if the online connection is lost regardless of what you're doing.-Poise system could use some rebalancing as it's almost irrelevant in it's current form.-No steam cloud support-No current known anti-cheat in placeOverall I see this as a great addition to the Souls Series and an excellent game in general.Highly recommendedEDIT: Also something I would just like to put to rest is the illogical argument people put forward about this game being like Bloodborne as a bad thing.First of all Sony asked From Software for a new game as they needed an exclusive IP for their console the PS4 and thus Bloodborne was.born (kek).So it really isn't suprising that Bloodborne shared a lot of simmilarities with the souls series, Considering it was made by the same developers and directed by Hidetaka Miyazaki.It's a shame that Bloodborne is exclusive to the PS4, But it's still an excellent game from the guys at From Software.So saying ""This game sucks, It's too much like Bloodborne"" is a completely illogical thing to say because both games are great. And if both games are great, Saying one is bad because it's too much like the other is an absolute nonsensical argument.",1
Positive,"Re-Written Review!Hi guys, I'm here to tell you about Dark Souls 3. This review is slightly more applicable for those who have played through the previous souls games, but is basic enough for people to get the jist if they haven't. Dark souls is a mesh between a horror/survival/adventure game. It's a game with an extremely visceral combat system that is extremely fair and true to hitboxes. If you swing your sword and it clips past their shoulder, it wont do jack. Weapons and movement within the game is tight, and your trusty sword and shield are your best friends.So, what's so special about Dark Souls 3? Well, Dark souls 3 has a fantastic world filled with delight, obscurities, and a variety of locations, creatures and bosses that will have you thinking ""Holy shit"". The game is built around the notion of a single goal, which is to acquire the souls of the Lords of Cinder, by slaying them. You aren't given a whole lot of direction, and there is definately no hand holding. If you like using your intuition, this is gonna be up your alley (As well as the other souls games!)So. What are the Pro's and Con's of the title?Pros+Detailed world, surprising amount of indirect lore and depth.+Runs great. Some people have issues, which is a shame, but it's a minority. It sucks, but this is launch. It's gonna happen. Smooth 60fps with the option for 4K textures makes this game a pretty one!+FANTASTIC sound design, from gurgling death sounds to boss music, the ambient and orchestral sounds are superb.+Swordplay, and general combat is tight as ever. You are making full use of the controller, with a huge amount of dynamic situations and variety.+Replayability. It's a souls game, and the souls games are renound for their replayability.+Interesting Characters and Questlines. NPC's are very memorable, even if their interactions are breif (yet very concise)Neutral points, here goes!/ The world is linear. Not as linear as Dark souls 2, but not as interconnected as Dark souls 1. This isn't a bad thing, Dark souls 1 was interconnected, but gave the impression that everything was tightly packed and squashed together. Dark souls 2 tried to give the sense of you travelling throughout a whole land, instead of a small chunk - however the levels often lacked. The variety was their, but the complex nature of dark souls 1 individual areas was lacking. Dark souls 3 makes a very nice mix of the two. There are many branching paths and a huge amount of verticality in the game, whilst still giving you a sense of direction./Covenants, which are the games factions, seem to be as niche as ever. They are ever more accessable, but still provide not a whole lot of content by themselves./Early game tends to favor the Knight class A LOT, and while there are many viable early game weapons, many will stick with the longsword for a while. Not a problem, but doesnt create a huge amount of variety.Cons-While more accessable, this game is still hard to get into (if you're new.) It's worth the try, but many simply dont understand it. It's like marmite, if you love it, you REALLY LOVE IT, but some simply just don't like it. That's fine.-Netcode issues. This is a pretty fucking big one right now. Dark souls matchmaking uses a dedicated server system to initiate the multiplayer, but multiplayer itself is P2P. It's a fantastic system that in dark souls 3, works very well (You can also password sessions!) But the netcode of the game has trouble handling packet loss, and its quite a big con. Enemy invaders or even your coop friends can be stuck in a limbo t-pose, showing no animations whatsoever. They are sometimes able to be invincible, or see the world in a completely different way. Many times i have invaded or helped with a boss and they just phase right through me, but i can still do damage. It's a huge problem right now for only the multiplayer portion of the game.Definately worth the price, and you will enjoy every minute of it if you are a fan of the dark souls games. There is a lot of homage to the series as it is rumored to be the last game (dark souls, not -souls- game).Buy it!",1
Positive,"Yes Indeed, This is the best Dark souls game.It's very easy to control more than DS , DS2. and I really like the community of this game, every invasion carry its own story there is a troller, cheater, lagger , noop, parry god. If you are interested in the story , I recommend you to watch the dark souls lore videos that's made by VaatiVidya Farewell, Ashen one. , . .",1
Positive,"Dark souls 3 is the game that got me in to the seriesIve got it from a humble monthly after wanting to play the game for a long timeI remember my frist experiance being trying to beat gundyr for the first time,and man was he kicking my ass. I remember when i have beaten him that i jumped out of my chair and screamed ""SUCK MY FUCKING DICK YOU DUMB MOTHERFUCKER TAKE THAT"". Now when i play the game i beat gundyr without taking any damage. And thats the beauty of the dark souls for me overcoming the challanges and making them your bi*ch,and feling fucking great when you do that. Dark souls 3 is the best in the series by my opinion. I have played dark souls 1 and 2 too but i dont enjoy them as much as i enjoy dark souls 3. Level design is best in dark souls 1 but where dark souls 3 shines the most is in combat. Its fast and the dodging feels reliable unlike dark souls 2 where there is input lag and im scared when i need to dodge because it sucks dick in dark souls 2, no longer you need to use a shield because of that and that makes for some great action. So in conclusion combat is best in the series.Thank you dark souls 3",1
Positive,Would HIGHLY recommend to those who are into Games that give you a challenge. If you are new to Dark Souls then go knight class most fun and gives you an OP Shield and gear that will last awhile into the game.,1
Positive,"I've played through Dark Salad's first two installments, though I'm not a massive fan of the series. That being said, here's my spiel on the third installment:From is one of those publishers who apparently really like to reuse their formula for gameplay. This is by no means a bad thing, especially since it works here. Overall, the movement for the player and for the varying sizes of flesh in this installment feels way less stiff from previous games. Movements feel faster and more fluid, allowing for combat to be way more intimate over previous installments where the stratagem was usally just to wait for Bigbritches McBossalot to do a heavy attack so you have time to peck at his ankles. The one place this falters, and feel free to tell me I'm wrong about this, is with shields that have 100% physical block. In my opinion, these things make Dark Sutra games way too easy, as only a handful of enemies have alternate means of damage.The enviornment of this game is something to behold. Many of the areas (save for some out of bounds nonsense, as per usual) are marvelously crafted and mind-bendingly interwoven. It's truly something to visit the other half of a destroyed bridge hours of meandering around later. Something I kind of hated about Dark Souls One was the amount of depressing caves and dark areas that were visually akin to hard pudding. There's a lot less of that here, and environments of that sort are better crafted this time around. All I can really say about PvP from my lack of expecience in prior games and lack of a pretentious state of mind is that it's a lot easier to have fun with it if you're new to the series. Being bad is totally fine, because odds are you'll have like 3+ dudes with you engaged in jolly cooperation anyway. Class rebalancing is pretty solid. Weapon stances are a welcome change to make melee combat seem less mundane. The same can be said for spells. Good God there are a lot of magic and faith options this time around-both in gear and in heathen spellcasting. There's so many that I'd even say that the devs clearly favored all classes having at least a bit of every category, because as Strength BigCubberhousen I feel that I'm missing out on quite a lot.Lastly, and this can be a good thing or a bad thing, Dark Souls Tres really, REALLY wants you to remember the first two games. There are so damn many references through bosses, enemies, equipment, areas, and everything else that are about the first two games, mostly Dark Souls One. I honestly feel that they overdid it a bit, because the game feels less like its own thing and more like a reimagining of the first installment. To this end, you might actually enjoy the game more if you haven't played previous installments.Overall, I'd say this game is worth your time if adventure games are your thing, casual or not. Given the game's resources for the player, these games really aren't as hard as they're infamously said to be. In fact, I'd say they do difficulty extraordinarily well, as encounters are engaging and require you to think quite a lot more than most other modern games, at least that I have played. Murdering those big bosses for the first time really feels like an achievement, and to me that makes the game well worth what I paid for it.In summary:",1
Positive,Long may the sun shine!,1
Positive,"Peak gameplay, peak music, peak characters. Absolute art. Also Firekeeper :3",1
Positive,"I want to make this apparent for everyone reading: Not everybody will be able to get into this. I enjoy it greatly, and hope others will. I don't want to glorify this in the wrong way, as it means different things to many.I feel that before I get into this review, I should give some elaboration on hardware. I can run things at a consistent 50-60 frames at low/medium settings (Textures and effects high, lighting low because of several bugs). This is what I'm running with -Graphics Card (GPU): AMD Radeon HD 7750Processor: Intel Core i7-3770 CPU @ 3.40 GHz16 GB of RAMBought this as a pre-built PC before I knew much about building; it's 4-5 years old at least.Now, that's out of the way, on to the review.I like this game. I like it because it reminds me vastly of Dark Souls 1, and moreso, Demon's Souls. Not in a bad way; rather, in a way that seems refreshing, and breathes a feel that is nostalgic and unique into everything. Mood, design, it's all a wonderful balance, in my opinion. It's paced a bit faster, but still begs the patience you'd expect from the franchise.That probably makes a bit more sense if you're a fan of the series already. If not, then whatever's below is for you.The Souls series, as it stands, is probably among my favorites. It's not for everybody, which is absolutely understandable. It's grim fantasy, and the gameplay, while being difficult, is not done justice by being described merely as such. It's difficult for the sake of making the player learn and overcome, as opposed to just making the experience more tedious or grueling. It's got a learning curve, and a more-than-competitive online aspect to it.That being said, each entry in the series is unique in it's own way. I'll avoid discussion of the other titles here, for the sake of keeping this a concise review. One could start with this being the first Souls game they play, and they'd be fine. Although, there's many references and lore implications in this game that allude to other games of the series. And speaking of lore, there's plenty of it to these games. It's rather vague at first, and much of it is in item descriptions, or the environment you explore, as well as characters you encounter. Personally, that makes it charming and intrigung to many, whereas for some, it makes it seem irritating and lazy. This is where it's up to the player to decide whether they want this, because again, it's not for everyone.So in the end, I've not played much of this entry in the series yet, regrettably. Though, of my 23.2 hours, most of it is probably PVP, which is without a doubt much more accessible in this game. I'd fully recommend this to anyone who's willing, because there's much to be experienced here. it's something I'd hope for many to enjoy.",1

Positive,"Rather fitting with the lore and themes of the game, Dark Souls III feels like a culmination of everything FromSoft has learned over making the entire souls series. Well, sort of.Does it capture the interconnected level design of the original Dark Souls? No, not at all. Does it have the exceptionally fair PVP of the second game? No, in fact in some ways they made it worse.But what it does take is the inspiration from the faster combat of Bloodborne, the level design and worldbuilding of Dark Souls, adds in an array of interesting and exciting bosses, and serves it up in a comprehensive Souls experience that's both interesting to veterans and accessible for newcomers.Sure the environments may feel a little unrefined and linear, and the throwbacks a little strange and overdone, but the sendoff (for now) to the Souls series is well worth your time, with a community that is still very much alive. Spam roll onwards, Ashen One.",1
Positive,"Dark Souls III is an easy recommendation for fans of the Soulsborne games. Virtually every aspect of the combat and gameplay has been refined from its predecessors, and the story provides a great bookend to the Dark Souls trilogy. For those of you who have never played a Soulsborne game before, I still suggest giving Dark Souls III a shot. Your first playthrough will be the toughest, but also the most memorable and rewarding. There will be many times when you want to quit, but keep going skeleton! Your first playthrough will easily take between fifty and sixty hours. Upon completion, you will be given the opportunity to continue in New Game Plus (NG+), which restarts the game from the beginning. The enemies are stronger and award more souls (experience and currency), but you get to keep your current level, weapons, gear, and spells. You will also be given the opportunity to make different decisions this time around concerning any NPCs and quests. There are three (technically four) different endings based on your actions, adding even more replayability to the experience.I was a little disappointed with Ashes of Ariandel my first time through. I completed it in its entirety in under five hours, and the new bosses were very lackluster, with the exception of Sister Friede. I developed a deeper appreciation for the lore of the DLC on my second playthrough, after completing The Ringed City DLC as well. The DLC did add a new PvP arena, and a PvP ranking system. Your rank (honor) nets you a badge that is displayed next to your name when summoned for co-op or PvP. A cool incentive for PvP focused players. The Ringed City delivered in every way that I could have hoped. Tough but fair enemies, powerful gear to be earned, some of the best boss fights in the entire game, and arguably the hardest boss in the entire series: Dark Eater Midir. From a lore perspective, The Ringed City answered a lot of questions the community and fans have had for three games now, and is the perfect swan song to the series.Dark Souls 3 is a masterful 9 out of 10 providing over 100 hours of gameplay. Dark Souls 3 is normally priced at $59.99, and the season pass will run you another $24.99. Try to grab the base game for under $25 for a great deal.

The difficulity of this game is in a tremendous high level, not only those boss could give you the nightmare, but also those creeps could kick your ass so hard. People suffered, but still whilling to play this game over and over again. A masterpiece of game, worth a shot.",1
Positive,"SPOILER FREE REVIEWDark Souls 3 is the third and most likely final installment of the Dark Souls series. It's a beautifully crafted goodbye letter to the fans. The game is set in the land of Lothric, presumably hundreds of years after the events of Dark Souls 1 & 2. The world is enormous and very diverse, albeit more linear than the land of Lordran from Dark Souls 1. The areas are quite large, filled with multiple pathways to explore. Fans of the first game will be pleased to see the return of shortcuts, a vital feature of the world design largely missing from Dark Souls 2. Both of these characteristics make the world of Lothric more like its DS1 predecessor, and personally, I quickly forgot about the linearity. The areas are fun to explore, their geographical positioning makes sense, and they follow the rule ""if you can see it, you can probably go there.""The story is written really well. It's full of mysteries and interesting things for the player to uncover. There are plenty of NPCs, most of them likeable, and their questlines are intriguing. As always, a lot of them are hard to find, and difficult to complete on your own during the first playthrough. The game contains a lot of references to both DS1 and DS2. Fans of the lore will surely get some answers. A few of the throwbacks serve merely as fan service, but the vast majority of them have purpose, and will make more sense after your first playthrough. There's a valid reason for their existence, but it's a spoiler free review. It is a sequel after all, probably the ending of the series, so no wonder plenty of things make a comeback.When it comes to graphical fidelity, Dark Souls 3 is the most beautiful souls game. It is largely thanks to using the same engine as Bloodborne, a game equally as stunning. The graphical options are nicely customizable, and you can notice the changes right away, without having to reload. The game's maximum framerate is 60fps. At launch, many players experienced crashes and poor performance, but most of these problems were fixed. While it's still not perfect, the game runs well, even on older hardware.Visual design is as always, top-notch. The world feels very believable, atmospheric, every single element looks amazing. The clothing in particular is the best in the series. Cloth and capes actually move, and your entire set gets more and more bloody as you progress through an area. There is plenty of armor and weapon sets to choose from, both old and new. Dark Souls 3 contains 100+ weapons, 80+ spells/miracles/pyromancies, and over 60 full armor sets. All of them look and feel great. There's plenty to choose from. You can build your character any way you want to. There are 19 bosses, with small exceptions, all of them are epic, and the fights are memorable. The game itself is full of secrets, secret areas. Illusionary walls work the same way they did in DS1. You have to hit it or roll through it, either's fine. It's definitely more intuitive than pressing buttons against every wall like in DS2. Gameplay is now more refined, and a bit faster than DS1 & 2. Enemies are more aggressive, and tanking hits is much harder now, especially in early game. Dark Souls 3 introduces a new mechanic called ""weapon arts."" Besides a normal moveset, each weapon has a unique ability/alternate 2-handed moveset. The addition of ""weapon arts"" gives even more flexibility to the way you play. Every weapon feels viable, and great to use. Spells, miracles, and pyromancies look awesome. Thanks to the return of the mana system from Demon's Souls (now called focus points or FP), magic users no longer have limited uses on their spells. A new item, Ashen Estus Flask allows you to regain your FP points. You can now split your number of Estus Flasks in any way you want to. For example, if your current maximum flasks number is 8, you can assign 6 of them for healing, and 2 for FP restoration. It is a neat little system, and makes magic even more viable and fun to play with.The online component is the best in the series. There are 8 covenants you can join, each with its own purpose, and backstory. The password system known from Bloodborne makes a return. You can now create a password, and share it with your friends. Then you will only be able to summon and play with people who use the same password. This makes co-op and online play with friends much more pleasant and easier to set up. Maximum of 6 player can be at once in a session. Due to the lack of a designated arena, many players use specific locations to create so-called ""fight clubs."" The host summons phantoms and invaders to battle each other with a specified set of rules, made up by all parties involved. The overall player count is extremely large, and you will definitely have no problem either invading or helping people/cooperating.Finally, let's talk about the soundtrack. As usual, very few areas have their specific themes. That's the nature of the souls games, you need full awareness of your surroundings. Boss themes is where the sound aspect of the game shines. The music is epic, and contains some of the best themes in the series. If you are super sensitive to spoilers, avoid listening to the OST outside the game. Song titles spoil the names of bosses.To me, personally, Dark Souls 3 is the best game in the series. It combines the best elements from all games, and makes them even better. Every game has its flaws and this one's no different. NG+ does not have too many changes, and one or two bosses weren't that great. Otherwise, there is not a lot to complain about. FROM Software still has its magic touch, and made a true masterpiece. Thankfully, that's not the end. There's still DLC to come, first one planned for fall. Judging by the level of quality of Bloodborne's DLC, I'm sure the additional content for Dark Souls 3 will be phenomenal. I strongly recommend this game. Now it's time for me to get all achievements and make plenty of new characters. See you in Lothric, and don't forget to Praise The Sun! \o/",1
Positive,"I Have played every Soul's/Borne (Platinated all except Demon Soul's) game and this one between my 2 favorites(Together with Demon's) . After 2 weeks i have finally managed to complete all the achievements in this game and while doing so i have loved every single moment of this game. Loved the design of the bosses ( even tough they're all pretty easy compared to all other soul's games (Except Nameless King that guy is one tough modafucka)The Pros of the game:The Design of all of the level's: Every single map in this game is awesome in it's own form ( tough i didn't like High Wall all that much)The Enemies are now alot harder: Normally the challenge of a game is it's bosses right? Wrong. in this one the bosses are easy and what stand's between you and them is the real challenge.The Co-Op: I had a fking level 280 character and still managed to find some guys to help me out in Nameless in NG ++ and could find some PVP in Anor Londo still.The Invasion's : Damn i never liked this part of the Soul's games before. guys hella stronger than you stalking around the boss area to cap your ass when you finally get there. But now everything is kind of balanced (Kind of) i managed to fight off 4 guys while on my way to one of the lords of cinder and some of then instead of ganking on you actually help when they think 3x1 is unfair.Now the flaws i saw in this game( only 1 actually)CONS: COVENANTSHoly Hell. I have no words to describe it. With the exception of Mound Maker's (favorite of mine), Warrior of Sunlight and Rosaria's Finger's ( Invading so obviously) all other covenants are dead useless. DEAD.Blade of the Darkmoon: Can only help Way of Blue. (Waited 3 hours in anor londo while i played on my PS4 to have a single invasion.Blue Sentinel's: Ditto as the aboveWay of Blue: only has players until the second or third area of the game and some rare ones later making the other 2 dead as hell.Watchdogs of Farron : did a run on the game with this one on all the time untill abyss watchers (literally went through the whole area's gathering all items at level 35 waiting for an invasion ( Yes i was at Sacrifice Road) never had a single invasion.(Tough i was invaded so kudos for that not as dead)Aldrich Faithful: Literally can only do it's thing in like 1% of game's area(from the area of a boss to the other wich is like 20 minutes of walk if you kill everything in your way and explore) but amazingly it is alive because of the pitfight's in the area( Power goes way up the head of some people i've seen some hot's using a whip and hitting the guys that didn't want to fight literally like he was the owner of the world).CON 2: COVENANT'S PART 2.Yeah.Covenant's again.Problem: as the 2 covenant's wich are to help way of blue are dead and dead as dead and dead( that's alot of dead) after the initial area's of the game you literally can't get rank's in those 2 without some HEAVY FARMING(BORING AS HELL) I Almost went into a Boringness induced coma farming the Proof of Concordt Kept to get the miracle and the ring.And some people really think it's the fault of the players for not getting the damn 30 things before you get to level 40.(Nuts i know)Apart from that farming of the other 2 went smooth ( Mound Maker's and Watchdog's of Farron) Mound Maker's i farmed at level 180 and still found people easily and Watchdog's is really easy to get the 30 killing some mobs in the swamp.Aldrich Faithful is easy too.So why the hell they did the hardest one and most boring one be the one that's the hardest one to find matches? Pure Evil? Satan advised those japanese to do it? probably but let's not get into that.All in All i really liked this game. But if those 2 covenant's ( Blue Sentinel's and Darkmoon) actually worked without depending of a single covenant ( Like making Darkmoon work just like in Dark Soul's 1 wich would be the dream)I would have been done with the 100% in about 30 hour's earlier ( I Just like to make 100% in soul's game's and i won't stop playing even now( i play dark soul's 1, 2 and Bloodborne all the time even to this day.But even with that this game get's about 99% of my love so this review will be a positive one.",1
Positive,this game is like mathyou fail it one time two times tree times four timesfive timessix times you get sad give up then wow you get the trick to do it so start over and fail because this is Dark soul not math,1
Positive,"If you're a Souls fan, looking forward to THE Souls-type-experience, you've come to the right place. Weapon Arts is a great addition to the gameplay, it doesnt just add an extra move, but it changes everything. You have 2 attacks (slow and light) and each weapon would have its own moveset, also you'd meet enemies who use it (NPCs or players). All and all, it brings a big change to the gameplay, while still remaining pretty familiar, if u're a Souls-fan.The music is exactly what you'd expect it to be for a Souls game, epic, right for the current moment, memorable and just simply enjoyable.To give a final conclusion, DS3 is a combination of Demon / Dark Souls and Bloodborne, bringing the best from those games - the art-design from Demon / Dark Souls, with some gameplay elements from BB, mixed up with typical Souls-gameplay with some new additions, like Weapon Arts. This cocktail brings us the best game which Miyazaki has made.",1
Positive,"I didn't like this game from the first try, got to lothric castle and couldn't kill prince there. Should have bail on the game for real. Multiplayer in this game is faster than ds2, seems even 2 fast if someone asks me. Mouse settings are the worst since camera move like 3 times faster than in scholar, stupid how it's worse while ds3 is newer game. From bosses i like only champion gundyr, locations are cool and some armor pieces. DLC is challenging and on some parts rly dumb level to increase difficulty. Getting back to ds3 from ER is very dissapointing. I jump instead of running and rolling 80% of times and often get hit or die bc of that. Why it's not like in ds2 where i can get 2 separate keys for rolling and jumping? I rly have enough of this game. Don't want to play this no more.",1
Positive,"Dark Souls 3 is more of what you love from the Dark Souls series (assuming you love it), but with vastly-improved visuals and a fluid framerate-provided you have a decent machine. Overall it's a damn fine finale for the series, and you won't hear any complaints about the gameworld being tacked together like Dark Souls 2-this one feels quite interconnected.Pros:-Graphics-Boss music-Atmosphere-Battle system-Bosses: they're big, bad and take a real beatingCons:-Aggravatingly obscure NPC quest lines (this is the only real frustrating and unfair part of Dark Souls III)-PVP: cheating and hacking are beginning to rear their collective head-Bosses: some are waaaaaay too easy (Wolnir), while some are going to have you ready to summon help (Abyss Watchers) after getting your ass handed to you repeatedly",1

Positive,"This is really the best game in the franchise. We can see in real-time as FromSoftware gained experience and knowledge over the years to evolve their unique franchise to keep up with constantly changing gaming standards. The combat and general movement system is much more fluid whereas in the previous titles, it was rather clunky and slow at times. Overall, Dark Souls 3 is just more refined and polished and also allows for faster paced action compared to Dark Souls 1 and Dark Souls 2. In 2024 and beyond, you can't even replay those older Dark Souls titles because of it lacking fluidity and modern features that now make video games great. The games are just too old now that it has become obsolete. DS3 can still be enjoyed, thankfully.The biggest issue is that, by the time Dark Souls 3 released, you already had a number of other video games of this idea by FromSoftware but also every other developer wanting to cash in on the design philosophy of making something that was very challenging to play, resulting in much of its criticism coming from people who were excited for another Dark Souls title but didn't yet realize that they had actually grown tired of the genre from overplaying DS1, DS2, Bloodborne, Armored Core, etc. Their failure to properly acknowledge DS3 as the best Dark Souls title mostly comes from nostalgia and rose-tinted glasses that prevents them from seeing beyond what they consider the best thing about DS1: its interconnected map. And that's about it. Because DS1 and DS3 are really the same two video games in terms of a bleak atmosphere and feelings of hopelessness, but DS3 is done better thanks to more polish. Even the argument that it is a ""rehash"" is not completely true, as these are games that are deeply invested in explorations of the ways in which histories and memories change with time, how experience with another or the unknown can alter or displace life from within the spaces it inhabits. DS3 isn't blindly copying its forebearers, it's very intentionally bringing spaces and experiences that the players themselves have seen into its vision of its own world. It would be weird if the game series that's about corrupted, degraded histories and memories didn't revisit and recycle its own settings.When it comes to the linearity of DS3, FromSoftware didn't implement the same interconnected map design of DS1 in future titles simply because it was, well, too convoluted. It was akin to a metroidvania and you could easily get lost and stuck and having to backtrack because you actually did go down the wrong path. What makes FromSoftware a great studio is that they learn from their mistakes. Where DS3 does it well is through its multi-layered and diverse levels such as Cathedral of the Deep or Irithyll or the Undead Settlement. You don't see anything like that in DS1 as its design is more focused on the overall world to deliver better replayability, but NG+ in DS3 is still good regardless.DS3 remains a consistent high 9/10 rating throughout while DS1 drops in quality after Anor Lando. There's great moment-to-moment gameplay in DS3 that is unmatched, it has the best level design in the trilogy (not to be confused with world design), and the best bosses in the series, where the bosses are also much more mechanically diverse.I'd really just recommend skipping out on Dark Souls 1 + 2 and just playing Dark Souls 3.",1
Positive,"Hi, in this review I will talk about how I appreciate the game and how you too could possibly find yourself some fun into the game.First comes my personal opinion on the first aspect of the game, despite the fact that most of the people leaves the game for their very first hours, fact relevent about if you are gonna appreciate the game or not. It may happen that people keep aside a certain pain coming from the game and focus about the lore, graphics, mechanisms and many other characteristics. In my opinion, that is the way for a true gamer to enjoy the game. Don't misunderstood something, their is good pain in this game, the one that make you gain something in result of your efforts. ( no pain no gain ) The next part is about ""noobs"" and the online aspect of the game.But sometime you may just not be able to beat a boss, that's totally understandable, the game has no ""easy"" option in his settings, well yes but, there is an online option in the settings. When you've enable online, you'll be able to co-op with else your friends or else randoms people, for understand well how online works I advise you to check the wiki of the game or else ask for some help for your issues on community servers such as discord or even Reddit. (because yes the game can be shitty about the proper functioning of online mode)And there are rewards for helping people so you can be sure that people will help you.Personally there were boring moments, I remember farming for many hours on some items but I did it and I was happy when it was done. Do what you gotta do, even if it's not satisfying in the beginning but as I said, no pain no gain.I hope this review was helpful to you.",1
Positive,"I've never played the first and the second game simply because I was intimidate by the Dark Souls franchise.It's a franchise that is well known to be hard, unforgiven and that only a a human with godly reflexes can beat but . . . obviously that's not quite the truth.The game is not actually hard, the only thing that is hard is that it's complicated at first for the player to understand that he isn't an overpowered human that can cut through an army of demon with a chainsaw or a semi-god that can kill gods with his bare hand, you are just a nobody that has to fight his/her way through a dark/corrupted world. You have to learn how to fight against giants, knights and a whole bunch of other creatures that are much more skilled than you.You will have to understand that to progress in this game, as well as any other From Software / any game in general, you will have to take some hit to learn how to dodge them, you will have to miss your attacks to know when to attack, you will have to lose to know how to win.The most important thing is to stay determined no matter what, if you are dying against a boss over and over again just stop playing for the day and come back the next one, it worked for me so maybe it will for you After more than twenty hours I finished the game and yes it wasn't easy, I died 104 times and yet I haven't fought against every single boss (I think that I am missing like 2 or 3, maybe 4) and I think that I will start on NG+ to see everything that the game has to offer.This game is worth your time if you are willing to let it teach you how to play it.",1
Positive,"What an amazing journey, an exciting adventure through strange and moody environments, with a variety of enemies (and friends!), a huge number of bosses, tonnes of weapons and armor to choose from, an just, ah, the best homage to DS1. I loved it through and through.PS Make sure to get both DLCs, they are great.",1
Positive,"The Best of the Dark souls series. go from Dark souls 1 to Dark souls 3, cause they are so much alike. Thanks Miyazaki!",1

Positive,"The deep, discoverable lore. The intense, controlled combat. The massive, well designed bosses. The creepy and beautiful monsters. The large selection of weapons and armor. The subtle story telling and amazing atmosphere. Everything Dark Souls One had which made it great is found here, with better graphics, cool new bosses and more engaging questlines and choices. It may lack the genius connectivity that the original game had, but it also references bloodborne and Demon's Souls, so that's a plus. Way, way better than Dark Souls 2, I think this is the true sequel to One, and the proper ending the series needed. I'm really looking forward to seeing what From Software makes next, but I hope they do something very different. I would love to see where their twisted animation and beautiful designs could bring us.",1
Positive,HEBLO AND WHALE COME TO MY REVIEW OF DARK SCROLLS 3 THE PHANTOM MENACEwow what a gate game this is lots of laughs and funt imes especial when yiou paly with ur frend @frotsy523 we like to summon each other in their cool 2 player system and paly threw the game lots of times i highly recomend this if u are good at games and like cool dark faantasy thing but READERS/GAMERS/FRIENDS B E W A R E. IT. IS. DIFFICULT. but well worth to learn and patient and play this game tought me pashience and therefore saved my relationship thanks from softwear and thanks bungie ok and thanks friends for doing a readong ob my rebiew!Have a nice night :-),1
Positive,"This is, in my personal opinion, the best game ever made.The bosses are amazing, the game's areas are detailed, the graphics are beautiful and the PVP is hilarious. You can be going through an area and a guy with only a loincloth and a torch could whip you into shape, or maybe a guy comes in with heavy armor and a huge sword and he dies in one hit. It's up to chance.Additionally, the game has just this right amount of challenge. It's not impossible, but it isn't going to hold your hand either. The first boss seems impossible when you first see it, but then you learn his moveset and pattern. After getting to NG+5 or so, you can go in with no armor or weapons and parry him backwards to death. The game has traps and things you wouldn't know from your first playthrough. If you play the game through twice, you already know most of the game by heart because you have to. It forces itself into your memory and makes itself unforgettable. All of the experiences you've ever had in the game will be with you until you die.I recommend this game and all of its DLC. Get it on sale if you want, though it is definitely worth the full price I paid.",1

Positive,"I figured my original review, which just stated ""Dope and dank"", needed an update. To put it simply, This game is a masterpiece. Demon Souls and Dark Souls are both fantastic games, but are quite dated, especially gameplay-wise, with their four-directional rolling. Dark Souls II is a pretty good game, my first Dark Souls game, and it improved upon Dark Souls in many ways, but was still worse than its predecesor. I have yet to beat Bloodborne, but I love it's atmosphere and it has a lot in common with Dark Souls III in terms of gameplay. Dark Souls III mastered combat in the Souls franchise. PvP feels extremely fluent and skill-based most of the time. The bosses are creative and fighting them doesn't feel like a chore, unless you get stuck, in which case, there's no harm in getting help from a phantom. Normal enemies feel pleasant to fight, they're put in okay places and when there's way too many, there's usually another way to deal with them.The visuals are incredible, the effects, enemies, and NPC's all come to life in Lothric, the fantasy world the game is set in. The bosses all have a menacing atmosphere, even The Deacons of the Deep which is jokingly easy, even if it was just a normal enemy.The DLC is nothing to complain about, it adds to the game and it is definitely worth the purchase.The soundtrack is one of the few video game soundtracks I listen to outside of the game, it's wonderful. It adds to the atmosphere incredibly well, and there's not a single song in the game that seems out of place.Overall, I give this game a 9.5/10, I feel like it's a modern classic, and it almost never feels boring. My only gripes are that the anti-cheat system is awful, it's somewhat short (but it doesn't bother me too much, as its replayablity value is off the charts).",1
Positive,"Farewell Lothric, Farewell Drangleic,Farewell Lordran.We have all spent so much time in your presence, explored every nook and cranny, laughed, cried, and cheered as we ventured forth through your unforgiving landscapes.After countless trails and obstacles, it's more than worth it to sit beside you and watch the fire finally take it's last breath.Even in the darkest of times, even the shadows cast by mere embers can shape how we see our surroundings, and Dark souls has cast shadows that we will all remember long after the fire has gone out.Thank you Miyazaki, for showing me the world you envisioned.And thank you, to the community, for allowing Dark Souls to become a respected roaring bonfire that can be seen across the gaming landscape.",1

In terms of game mechanics there is not much new, except for the behemoth-esque bosses to which you can utilize the familiar souls fighting scheme on.

Positive,"At first game seems hard and some may say impossible, but after few tries (and deaths) you start to understand that world of Dark Souls is brutal and not forgiving. Everything has its own attack patterns and you need to learn them by method of trying. The satisfaction you get after defeating hard boss is glorious. Storyline is ominous and hard to learn. You can't simply say that it's the hardest of the franchise because as wise people on reddit say: First souls game is the hardest.",1
Positive,"After playing (and loving) all three Dark Souls games, this is absolutely my favorite.IF YOU HAVE NOT PLAYED ANY DARK SOULS BEFORE:Please do not be scared by what you may have heard of difficulty level of Dark Souls. It s difficult, but it s designed around that. Don't be afraid if you are the kind of player (like me) who sets Skyrim to the easiest difficulty. In most games, I do not like very much of a challenge. But there is something that sets Dark Souls games apart. And that something makes the challenge tons of fun even for someone like me.IF YOU HAVE ALREADY PLAYED DS1 OR DS2:Have no fear, for Dark Souls 3 is wonderful. It has its quirks and flaws, but on the whole I have to say that it is the best of the three games. I could go on about all the little differences, but most of them are fairly insignificant.The biggest difference is that the bosses are BETTER. Now, I realize that this is highly subjective, but I enjoy the boss fights in this game more than those in Dark Souls 1 or 2. And I love those games.CONCLUSION:Dark Souls 3 is my absolute favorite video game, period. You should play it, because there s a fair chance that it will earn the same spot for you.Oh! One other thing I have to mention is what it's like to play the game with a mouse and keyboard. I can gladly say that it works perfectly fine!

Positive,"When you get old in life,you start to think that u have seen everything. I mean,i played a lot of games,and i know that in the majority of them,after 10 minutes of gridding i'm able to defeat that boss and continue the game. I know that after some hours i will master that game,and will finish it without problems. Now just forget all this.To beat this game YOU have to be better every moment.Equips and level are just a detail,its your strategy of exploring your quality and the enemy weekness that will decide the fight.You will lose that line of thinking ""Thats impossible"" and ""I will never be able to do that"", and start to say ""And if i try that diferent way"" or ""I will try it 1000 times,but if in the 1001 i suceed,then will be worth it"".",1

And also, i enjoyed the game so far!Yes, it's way faster just like bloorborne, but still has own features. The first boss as you all know is a pain in butt for some people, but still enjoyable and interesting.And hey, that's the stuff to which you have to be prepared! This ia a HARD game!Anyway, i still didnt finish the game, and just want to say that i RECOMMEND this game.Yeah, you might have problems, but it's only some chance. And it's Dark souls. If you played previous parts, prepare to lose pretty much there.Good luck, stranger! Praise the Sun!",1

Positive,"Review by UnamDark Souls 3 is a fantastic game that is definitely worth your time. By far the strongest asset this game has are the bosses, out of the entire trilogy this game has the most memorable and challenging bosses that are a true test of your skills. The soundtrack is also fantastic and atmospheric, all of the tunes and songs just click together like a puzzle piece. Something that is very important is that Dark Souls 3 takes a different approach to difficulty, compared to Dark Souls 1 and 2 that had some bullsh*t moments where you didn't know where to go and keep dying to the same enemies, whereas Dark Souls 3 has a more linear and focused method of challenging the player, but this, by all means, does not mean that the game is not hard, Dark Souls 3 will whip your ass until you ""git gud"".Where the game falls short is in the world. Where Dark Souls 1 had an interconnected world that naturally flowed together and Dark Souls 2 had a non-linear world, Dark Souls 3 has a world that feels very linear, with not as many directions that the player can go through, which may make multiple playthroughs feel repetitive.Apart from a minor hiccup, Dark Souls 3 is still the best that the franchise has to offer, and is worth your time. I give Dark Souls 3 a. More Reviews here!",1
Positive,"This game is pretty good, however, there is a feature that bogs this 8/10 game to a 6/10The main issue is that magic is too hard to use. As a big fan of bethesda titles such as skyrim, morrowind, and oblivion, I enjoy myself some wizardry.However, this game FORCES you into this weird 2.5d camrea, which is fine and all. BUT. if your like me and is accustomed to a from a rich competitive environment your used to aiming in the first person POv. this game however seems to made for concol plebs who can't shoot a gun or control recoil if there life depended on it. Now this would be fine if this game had some sort of autoaim feature, such as the one in games like fortnite or gta V (concol versions of course). Also, this game is NOT keyboard friendly, as all of the controls are explained in the context of using a controller. It is a shame that such a potentially e-sports ready game have so many obvious flaws, I hope ubisoft fixes these issues ASAP.Now I'm not one to lie, this game series has a LOT of fun to be had, I recommend it for more casual players, now if your like me and you're a hard/core gamer (like me) then you might not have a lot of fun with it.I give this game 6 popcorns out of 10 :-).",1
Positive,"Best of the Souls series. arguably the most inspirational series of the generation came to a conclusion with Dark Souls 3 and it is a great conclusion the world may be linear and not stacked onto itself like the first half of dark souls 1 but where that game falls short in the second half, this game has the best second half of the series with god tier boss fights and locations seeing the first view of the Irithyll of the Boreal Valley was Jawdropping and it never gets old Every time you visit and the Ringed City DLC could arguably be the best dlc in the series aswell with an unforgettable boss fight. this game was worth every penny when it first came out and nowadays with a sale its a no-brainer to get.Rise Ashen One and Link the Fire once again.",1

Positive,"Dark Souls 3 was the first Souls game I found myself truly enjoying. While the hard slog through the trials and tribulations of Dark Souls 1 was appealing on paper, in reality, the low production values, low impact combat, and technical issues left me uninterested, and Dark Souls 2 is Dark Souls 2, so yeah.Where DS3 succeeds is in broadening the appeal of the franchise without diluting what makes it special - at least not too much. Purists will rightfully complain about the more linear, simplified experience, and while DS3 is clearly nowhere near as masterfully designed as DS1, as a game it performs much better. The technical competency is miles beyond DS1 and DS2. Combat is incredibly meaty, each blow translating a hugely satisfying sense of weight and impact. The audio that accompanies the combat may as well be ten generations apart; it's that good, and the boss fights music is often extraordinary. I tend to be quite hyperbolic when I find something I like, but in the case of DS3, it's no hyperbole - the music is really damned good. In fact, most of the game is.There is a clear feeling of progression - this is very much a journey, moreso than the somewhat stagnant, inter-connecting affair of DS1. New areas present new enemies, fortunately without much recycling, and these enemies have more diverse tactics than in previous games. The combination of different threats and larger groups of foes makes the faster, more tactile combat feel significantly more exciting and demanding, without being overly challenging.The addition of the Weapon Art mechanic gives each weapon a special skill, and though many weapons share movesets and WAs, the added depth is a pleasant touch that creates some interesting opportunities, though expect to rely on them in PvP more than PvE.Once you start joining the dots together - weapon arts, big groups of enemies, increased speed, the new animations and more - it all comes together to form a rather special game. DS3 is fast, and it's intense, and it rewards involvement and risk with great satisfaction. I would often hold my breath during encounters, especially in PvP; exhaling after surviving another grueling fight with only a sliver of health remaining. What it does is manipulate you to an almost hilarious degree: impeding navigation with poison, placing enemy ambushes around corners, having horrible Cthulu-esque monsters drop down on you from above, spikes, death pits and more - it's all there to scare you, to make you feel tiny and insignificant. And when you learn where enemies are, and where the threats lie, and you gradually master each area - that satisfaction is unbeatable. DS3 doesn't have the deepest combat around, it's not a particularly difficult game once you get used to it, and it's not going to kill you unfairly; instead, it presents challenges which are designed to intimidate you while also offering a small glimmer of hope, and once you pull through, you feel amazing.That satisfaction extends to the boss fights, which at times can be reduced to a simple gimmick, but are mostly solid, and occasionally fantastic. One of the more memorable bosses is actually the first one you encounter; at first you're fighting a big guy in big armour, and suddenly he transforms into this nightmarish, draconic beast. This idea of transformations or ""phases"" extends to all of the fights, meaning that unlike the previous Souls games, every boss in DS3 will have a certain line of progression in each fight. It's not unfair, either - they may regain health, use a new weapon or become more aggressive, but it always feels like you have a chance, and if not, there tend to be shortcuts straight to the boss arenas to minimise frustration.Unfortunately not everything is sunshine and rainbows, because the game does have its problems. I've only touched on some of the positive aspects because there's a lot to cover - a hugely improved UI, some great lore, fantastic looking equipment and so on - but the game does have downsides.The elephant in the room is PvP, specifically, invasions. Invaders are at a huge disadvantage in DS3; not only do you get less than half the estus that the host has, but the host can also summon up to four phantoms, turning it into a 5 v 1; they can also use a special item that makes all of the area's enemies hostile to invaders; they also have a habit of instantly re-summoning phantoms when you kill them, which means that it essentially becomes a battle of attrition that's impossible to win. Stamina usage is also inexplicably unbalanced in DS3. Every action costs stamina, and you can roll to avoid attacks. You used to be able to roll at most around 7-9 times in DS1; now, you can roll 14-15 times, and stamina recovery is faster, too. This means that builds that focus on fast attacks are simply impossible to beat if you're good enough. You can roll 10 times, attack once, and then roll some more and avoid ever being hit. These issues are exacerbated by certain items that boost rolling, and if you watch any DS3 PvP video, you'll see that 99% of the action are rolls. Previous games in the series promoted the use of defense with shields, parries and heavy armour, but DS3 basically asks you to just roll all the time. It's boring, it's ridiculous and it trivialises PvP combat.Somewhat related to PvP, but many weapons also have identical movesets among their classes. This isn't too much of an issue, but it's a shame to see a tiny axe having the exact same moveset as a huge, 30 kilo, two-sided magical war axe. The existing movesets are also rather unbalanced, too. Fast weapons are objectively better than slower ones in almost every scenario, and like I said before, fast builds will always beat slow builds if both players are equally skilled, and it's a shame. Poise has been re-implemented in an interesting way, but the importance of armour and defensive play is still very much diminished compared to the previous games. Oh, and magic is borderline useless in PvP because you can just walk to the left and/or roll once and never be hit.Covenants are also hugely simplified, with no entry requirements, special missions or structures. It's basically ""Do you want to join? Okay, now kill 10 people for reward 1, then kill 20 more for reward 2"". That's all there is to it. Sure, you have to kill different kinds of people, but there's no complexity to it. They're boring and unoriginal.The linearity of the game is an issue. The series prides itself on its interconnected level design, and while it's still there, there are moments in which you're basically running in a well disguised straight line. Apart from not being particularly interesting, the simplicity of the world's layout lowers the skill barrier, makes the rest of game's relative lack of complexity more evident, and reduces replayability. It's a shame, because DS3 capitalises on some extraordinary artwork (in spite of the ancient graphics technology) to create some breathtaking scenes, but it never quite reaches the highs found in DS1.Speaking of DS1: DS3 suffers from d j vu. Some areas, enemies, animations and items are copied wholesale from the first entry in the trilogy. Upgraded graphics and small cosmetic changes don't hide the fact that DS3 at times feels like a spin-off of the first game. In fact, it's not even limited to copying previous Soulsborne titles; there is an entire area around half way through the game that is literally cloned and re-decorated later on.There are other issues, but suffice to say that DS3 isn't perfect. However, I found myself absorbed in the game. Regardless of its shortcomings, it's an exciting adventure and one of the most satisfying games I've played. It's both the best and the worst entry in the series in many ways, and that inconsistency may disappoint those expecting another Dark Souls 1. DS3 doesn't reinvent the genre, but while it occasionally lags behind, it's also capable of soaring ahead.",1
Positive,"At the time of writing, I am totally new to the genre and in the space of around 14-15 hours I have died around 60 times. This game is a treat to play, a difficult and fair learning curve which rewards patience and punishes recklessness. The music and visuals are superb and I cannot wait to see what more is on offer. Will update when I have finished, whenever that may be.Update:Having finished Dark Souls III, my first ever game in the Souls series and can say without doubt that it is easily one of the most unique gaming experiences out there. It s an understatement to say that the series redefined the RPG genre in its own way, as the Souls series (through my experience playing DS3) fortified itself as a paragon within the industry. I understand this now. But onto the game itself. As I mentioned before, it is a brutal learning experience which will absolutely waste anybody who intends to hack and slash their way through the intricate, lore-steeped world. Likewise, if you take the time to carefully think about your next move, to learn when to strike, when to dodge and when to avoid a conflict altogether the game rewards you generously. You must be willing to learn from your mistakes to succeed and in doing so, Dark Souls III returns the favour by offering one of the most cathartic and fulfilling experiences in videogames. The tension in trying to reach that next bonfire, not knowing what awaits you around the corner, is palpable yet once you reach that safe-point, it feels well earned and you can take a breather knowing that you have done well to get that far. This constant feeling of tension and relief, whether it is a boss, a bottleneck of tough enemies, a desperate attempt to find that next bonfire knowing your souls are constantly at stake, is a wonderful formula. The gameplay itself features a tight and crisp combat system. Many of the enemies you will meet are unique and have their own attack patterns which can be countered and taken advantage of provided you take the time to properly learn their patterns. This applies to all enemies, from the lowliest Hollows, to the mightiest of the lore s Gods. Any mistakes which are made are on you and no amount of frustration will change that. When you do overcome that one challenging enemy, the reward stays with you and you channel that energy into the next challenge you meet. That is the beauty of the niche gameplay mechanics of the game, and Dark Souls III teaches you this very quickly by introducing you to a boss within the first 5 minutes of gameplay followed by one of the most challenging areas in the entire game for newcomers. Continue to persevere even more and you will have the pleasure of witnessing some of the finest boss fights put to play. Some are better than others, but for the most part they leave an imposing impression either through their design, their fight, their story or all of those factors. The aesthetic design of the world of Dark Souls III is grim, gritty, morbid and genius. Much of the lore of the game is presented to you through the design of the game itself, like an artist trying to convey a story through their canvas. As the Unkindled, you feel loosely tied to this world where much of the story has already been told from ages past, but is now in decay and you must decide what will become of it. There is no true happy ending only fleeting outcomes which may or may not make a difference in the future. In short, this game is nihilism made flesh. The soundtrack is masterful, for the majority of the game. Every single boss has their own unique orchestrated theme. Like the boss fights themselves, some can be lacklustre, but when there is a boss which means business the soundtrack is there to back it up. Truly a feast for the ears. All in all, if you have never played a Souls game start with this one. Take it from another first timer when I say that Dark Souls III is an incredible genre-defining experience which has endured the test of time. You owe it to yourself to try it out if this game clicks for you as it has me, it will leave a remarkable impression. The reputation the Souls series has gathered for itself truly cannot be overstated. 9/10As a side note: There are a few issues with online play. Invasions and co-op play can generally be riddled with lag and latency issues, but this is a minor one. A larger one is the growing presence of hackers, some of which have the potential to corrupt save files from what I have heard. Remember to back up your saves regularly if you intend to play online or use a mod designed to protect you (such as Blue Sentinel).",1

Positive,"Dark Souls 3 is a great balance between the first game and the second. It has all the amazing moments and subtle coherency and cohesiveness of the first game while also bringing with it some gameplay improvements from the second. I appreciate the balance, especially leaning a bit more towards Dark Souls 1. I do miss the powerstancing from Dark Souls 2, but I'm happy that they left the other mechanics behind. For some people it comes down to what you were introduced to, and I started with Demon's Souls. After playing Dark Souls 1 it became my favorite and remained that way. Dark Souls 3 being a close second. Those of you introduced to Dark Souls 2 first may have entirely different feelings towards Dark Souls 3, understandably so. Even if it may not rank highly on your favorite list, we all know each and every Souls game is an amazing experience.",1
Positive,"Wow. just wow.Before this game I only played and finished Dark souls II in the souls series (and tried a bit of Bloodborne), but I can say Dark Souls III is a huge upgrade.The graphics are incredible, it is easier to pick up the story and lore aspects than DS2 (while remaining hard to undersatnd like in the other souls games), the combat feels tighter and quicker, the levels are dense and well-built, the monsters and the bosses (that I encountered so far) are well-crafted and well-balanced,And of course the challange - it is harder than DS2 (I understood from reviews that it resembles DS1 in it's difficulty) - and I love it!I do have some FPS drops here and there, but nothing that would ruin my experiece.overall, this is a must buy in my opinion for someone who loves well-crafted RPG fantasy games with tons of lore that challange you in every step of the game.Praise the sun, and good luck - because you're going to need it :)",1
Positive,"The most accessible introduction to Dark Souls. Dark Souls is extremely rewarding to 'git gud' at because the world makes no pretensions about being fair. Your character is often times, and especially on NG+, not stronger or tankier than any of the enemies. Hell, often times you're not even faster and you're susceptible to more hit stuns than they are. So your only choice is to outwit, outspace and outplay the AI which feels utterly amazing.",1
Positive,"DSIII has the worst atmosphere, in my opinion, out of the 3 mainline Souls titles. The two biggest draws to the series for me are 1) The atmosphere, and 2) How good the games feel mechanically to play - DSIII *feels* the best, mechanically, to play. Everything from rolling, blocking, parrying, R1/R2, weapon arts (though new to this entry) feel the best they've felt in any of the main 3. I recently went back and beat 1's Remaster, and I'd forgotten just how bad it felt to have to come to a full stop to drink Estus. It's painful. DSIII is mechanically one of the most rewarding games to play, well, ever. The (viable) build variety is at an all time high in DSIII as well. There's SO many different weapons/magic/pyro/miracle combinations that are viable to put together that it makes the game extremely rewarding to replay. Voice acting is as good as it ever gets in FromSoft titles - some of the line delivery gives me goosebumps still even after hearing it for the 100th time. The bosses are mostly quite fun, though some are kind of more RNG heavy-feeling even than they felt in DSI/DSII, in that some runs, I'll absolutely easily WRECK a boss, 1st try, in a minute or less, then in another run, the boss will happen to do a totally different set of moves, and feel 1,000% harder because of it. Partly just the nature of the beast, I think.Although I don't think the atmosphere feels as oppressive, depressing, and. mournful as it often does in I and II, it's not without its moments - Irithyll comes to mind immediately. That + its Dungeon are two of my favorites in the entire series. The art design of III is an absolute high point - there's so much loving detail in every single area, room, corners of rooms. If you've ever been curious at all about the Souls series, but haven't jumped in, DSIII is a good place to start. The mechanics feel more player-friendly than I or II ever did. If you keep a guide handy, even if you're a total noob, you'll be able to beat this game with patience and dedication to it, and it's worth it IMO. Although, I wouldn't go into expecting the ending itself to be *the* point of playing the game. The endings are. serviceable, but they're very similar to the other entries in the series, and they're kind of not the point of it, in a weird way. This is a game that definitely actually deserved its full price tag, and if it's ever $40 or $50, it's worth that too.",1
Positive,"Not as hard as people say, still a really fun game. Now the DLCs, oooh! those are evil. Hard af.",1
Positive,"You will die, a lot. You will die by a slash of a sword, by a slice-and-dice axe, by a bonecrushing hammer, or by a piercing spear; you will be poisoned, eaten, stabbed, assassinated and pushed off cliffs. Death is everything in Dark Souls III. It is education, it is progress, it is the recurring stylistic and thematic motif that runs through all of its spectacularly varied, decaying and depraved environments. The first thing that you have to understand about this game is that survival is in itself a tremendous accomplishment. It can be punishing, cruel, sadistic and uncompromising. It can also be the purest, most thrilling adrenaline rush in your gaming experience since forever it can take over your life and reward you like nothing else can. Because your chances of success seem so slim when first starting up a new game, each victory feels monumental and self-gratifying. The DLCs' are also great and thrilling to play through, and in my honest opinion also have some of the greatest and most arduous boss fights you will ever encounter in the Dark Souls series, but i'll let you decide on that matter. One of the most memorable experiences that I've ever been blessed by, therefore I shall rate this game 10 out of 10 finger but holes!",1
Positive,"My rating - 4.5/5.The game starts of difficult but gets easier as you progress through the game as you get more weapons and options to take on your enemies.

Positive,"Done the game and both DLC, that was a great pleasure to play this game.I ve came here after I ve done Sekiro (my first From Software game), DS Remastered and Scholar. First thing I ve noticed that it s much faster game than Remastered and Scholar, more closer to Sekiro in terms of pace, if I can say so. Mostly I ve done game pretty much ok mostly in Offline mode, all bosses I ve done without help of other players (though I ve used NPC s from time to time, few of them were useless btw). I think I ve lost more attempts to Nameless King and Sister Friede (around 40 combined) than to every other boss in the game combined. Dancer took me around 10 attempts, Lord of Cinder 3-4, Slave Knight also 3-4 same goes for Midir. About DLC s, try to buy Season Pass on Sales, they re not worth full price for them. Especially after so many years. Better buy Elden Ring at this point. DLC Ashes of Ariandel Really cool looking DLC, I ve liked visuals of this one more than Ringed City, but it s shorter, took me around 4.5 hours. There are some cool weapons and enemies in this DLC. DLC The Ringed City It s a bit longer than the first one, I ve found this one more difficult, there are a lot of strong enemies there. Bosses in this DLC are great, don t miss dragon though, you can get cool katana off his soul. Now, I will wait for Elden Ring.",1
Positive,"Dark Souls III is a masterful conclusion to the beloved action RPG series, offering a harrowing yet captivating journey through a world on the brink of apocalypse. The game strikes an impressive balance between familiarity and innovation, refining the core mechanics that fans have come to love while introducing new elements that enhance the overall experience.The Kingdom of Lothric and its surrounding lands are visually stunning, showcasing From Software's most impressive environmental design to date. Each area is meticulously crafted, offering breathtaking vistas and a strong sense of place that draws players into the game's rich, melancholic atmosphere. The interconnected world design remains a hallmark of the series, though the ability to teleport between bonfires from the start alters the traversal dynamics somewhat.Combat in Dark Souls III is fierce and punishing, yet deeply rewarding. The introduction of Weapon Arts adds a new layer of depth and flexibility to the already robust combat system, allowing for more varied and stylish approaches to encounters. Boss fights are particularly memorable, often featuring multiple phases that keep players on their toes and require careful strategy to overcome.The game's narrative and lore are as cryptic and engaging as ever, with plenty of interesting characters to meet and questlines to unravel. Dark Souls III cleverly weaves elements from previous games into its story, creating a sense of nostalgia for longtime fans while still offering a fresh experience.Technically, the game is a visual masterpiece, with stunning environments and detailed character models. However, some players have reported performance issues, particularly on PC, which may detract from the experience for some.Despite minor flaws, Dark Souls III stands as a triumphant finale to the series, offering a challenging, immersive, and deeply satisfying experience that will captivate both newcomers and seasoned veterans alike. Its meticulous attention to detail, refined gameplay mechanics, and rich world-building make it a standout title in the action RPG genre and a fitting send-off for one of gaming's most influential franchises.",1

But. don't buy this game. It's not fun anymore. The Dark Souls 3 Hayday of summon signs everywhere and constant good invasions is over.

This game is not worth the multiplayer.EDIT - A 2024 UPDATE TO MY OPINIONExcellent game the origin of my Soulslike addiction, and for good reason.

Positive,"This review comes from a player who have never got banned or came across a hacker after more than 150h playtime Overall Dark Souls ExperienceMy name is Gal and I am a huge fan of the Dark Souls game searies. I strated playing the first game out of the three in 2013 and finished it twice (on PC and on XBOX 360). While playing Dark Souls 1 I became obsessed with the game and loved every single thing about it. Then, in 2014 Dark Souls 2 was born and a new saga began to the Dark Souls searies. I have played the second game the second it came out and I finished it a week after, and to be honest, it wasn't a blast. I had fun time playing it, but it was just not like the first game.And then, Dark Souls 3 showed himself to the world in 2016. Current State in Dark Souls 3Finished the game about 4 times. Have 3 PvP players. Playing a lot of PvP, and trying to get more characters to level 120 (PvP Meta). First CutceneWhen I launched the game for the first time I was so happy to go back into the world of Dark Souls, the menu screen, the sounds, everything was exactly like good old Dark Souls. Then, the first cutscene started (and with it the goosebumps ^^) and god. oh god the voice acting in this game is just. SO GODDAMN GOOD! Already in the first cutscene you hear an old woman's voice telling you about the history of a place called Lothric and while hearing the woman's voice you see characters and lords that you know, you are going to meet and probably fight. First Gameplay and Boss ImpressionThe gameplay starts, and you pick up your Ashen Flask after killing a bunch of dudes and then you light the first bonefire, wasn't so hard right? Meeting the first boss 2 second later gives you that breathtaking feeling that you are fighting against a gigantic armored guy that got some cool moves. After few tries you manage to take him down to half health and you see phase 2, and oh god, that is just terrifying! Some dark creature is just cracking his way up from that guy and you need to fight against it! After managing to take that thing down you fully walk into. the world of Dark Souls 3! 40 Hours Into the GameYou are geared up, got your own playstyle with unique swords and spells and you crawl deeper into the dark lore meeting up glorious and scary bosses. In your journey you get to choose things that will affect the end that you will get ( there are 3 endings to the game and another special end ) and to be honest, on my first playthrough, I didn't knew what I was actualy picking (Blind playthrough) but at the end I figured it out. Story: 8/10 - I realy love the Dark Souls franchise lore (the things I know about it.) but I didn't like it so much how the developers delivered it in the third game. there are a lot of NPC questline that you most likely missed on your first playthrough and how the lore is being told. it is too foggy in my opinion. Sounds (Music and Voice Acting) : 10/10 - The music in this game just matches so good into some situations and the voice acting is amazing. Gameplay and Mechanics (Xbox 360 Controller) : 9/10 - I realy enjoyed how the game is being played and the new weapon arts is just great. I was sad to see that they took down the dual wielding stance and some of the mechanics are just hiddin inside the game and you only realise them when watching a toutorial or by accident. PvP and Online Matchmaking: 8/10 - Dark Souls 3 is the first Dark Souls game I started playing PvP and I having super fun with it. The problem is that some of the weapons are just not balanced enough and the hitbox can be a pain in the ass sometimes. Graphics and Sceneries: 10/10 - The game looks great and most of the sceneries are so amazingly good ( Irithyll of the boreal valley was just so beautiful ).This was my first review, hope you guys liked it :)",1
Positive,"One of the best games i've played ever, completed NG today unlocking one of the three endings and there is still plenty left for me to do. The boss fights were both challenging and rewarding, The PVP was intense, and the lore was great. It combines all the best elements of the Soulsborne games into one super game essentially. There are glitches and bugs here and there which I hope FROMSOFT fixes like the no animation summons/invaders as well as lack of summons for Sentinel/Darkmoon covenant members, but other than that, I enjoyed the game a lot and will continue playing for a long time :D! Thanks FROMSOFT!9/10 (10/10 with ember)",1
Positive,"I remember seeing a trailer for Demon's souls on gametrailers back when it was about to release in north america. Now I've always been a big fan of monster hunter so when I saw the main character run around in 3rd person perspective, wielding an enormous demon killing sword, I just had to get my finger in it. Even though it wasn't clear whether it would even release in the EU.Two games followed which indeed was memorable, but still was lacking something.Then this finally came along. The third and supposedly final installation of the series.There is something here for new players as well as for old. It's basically like if you combined all the four games into one.The thing I really love about this game is the atmosphere and if you're into gory, dark fantasy, worlds shrouded in fog with bosses way stronger than you then this is the game for you.Just be prepared to die. a lot. :)",1
Positive,"I might review this game very late. Especially when sekiro is already launched. I see some people got over hyped by sekiro and thinking it's good for someone very new to souls like series. But i rather recommend this game compared to sekiro which need more skills in my opinion since i rely on poise and spells in dark souls 3 so i am positive that sekiro is not my play style. Either way i recommend this game to anyone who might not be familiar to souls game if you are scared with invaders play offline mode or just ask your friend to accompany you.Community is cancer :D even when playing with friends. There are so many cheaters on low level you might wanna play offline untill reach level 200+ even though it doesn't guarantee there will be no cheater on that level. The cheaters can ruin your game, your save and might get you banned check discussions for details it is quite annoying. You can report them but they just gonna do familly sharing and make a new account , which was reenabled? as far as i know. Didn't experience being hacked my self, but i believe i got invaded by hacker once? i am helping my lower level friend in high wall of lothric, 1st map of the game after the tutorial. An invader came and make me and my friend got ""Cursed"" status, i believe there are no spell that gives this status from players, also we are near the boreal boss. also encounter a ""no clip"" invader where he straight just blink to my friend who is far away even though he was infront of me a second ago. Got no proof so you might not want to believe me, but i do believe you don't want to experience this. So becareful when you are playing online. I just remembered, something does goes wrong with my account, i think some hacker did it or it's a game bug? I can no longer use dark hand or the pyromancy that fist the enemy and then burning finger them as an offensive weapon. i mean i can grab them sometimes, but not damage anyone with it. well most of the time i use dark hand as a shield bcs it barely has any weight, still annoying when you want to screw arround your friend and ended up doing nothing at all.I hope ELDEN RING won't have this kind of problem. but that's too hopeful of me for a PC game",1
Positive,It hurts and I like it,1
Positive,"this ds1,ds2,bb have wrecked all other games for me.they all feel very empty and unrewarding compared to the souls games,sekiro is also a amazing game .",1

Positive,Fantastic game. Love coming back to it.,1
Positive,"I feel like a lot of people who don't play Dark Souls come to it for the wrong reasons. The series has become this symbol of difficulty and challenge but the funny thing is it's not that difficult, but it's hard to believe that when you get slapped around by the tutorial boss like you're a cheap whore. Still, once you figure the series out its smooth sailing from there. When I originally pirated DS3 in 2016 (forgive me Lord Gaben), I'm pretty sure it must have taken me at least 60-100 hours to beat. The game felt impossible but when I beat it I felt rewarded and that feeling pushed me to play the other souls games. And now years later, after beating many soulslike games from From Soft and other studios, I've realised that these games aren't that difficult, you just have to think a little differently to play them and that the main attraction of these games isn't the difficulty but the world around you.When you start Dark Souls 3 , you're surrounded by graves. There's an unsettling feeling that this game is different from other games and that you're not in a happy hopeful world. Even the boss fight against Gundyr makes you wonder, this huge man-like statue impaled by a sword. Who is he? Why is he stabbed? And is he gonna slap me around like a cheap whore (yes)? For a game this bleak and dark, it induces so much wonder. I will never not awe when you open the door to the High Wall of Lothric. That's what Dark Souls is about, this feeling of ""Oh shit! I am here!"".Since getting this game on steam I have played this game twice, first playthrough lasting about 10 hours and second around 6. This game is not as difficult as people say it is, the original Super Mario is harder than this game, actually any Mario game is harder than this game and yet it never gets boring. In a lot of other games when you get used to a game and it starts getting easier, it becomes boring but here the enemies and levels are designed in a way that no matter how good you get, you still have to think and pay attention. It's never mindless and mashy. I say it's easy but at the same time I know that one second of not thinking about what I do could lead to death. If you're struggling to beat this game, here's a tip, it's not about how much damage you do or how much you grind your stats, you have to learn the patterns of your enemies. Trust me, the game becomes wayyyyy easier once you start paying attention to that.I played this game so many times back when it first came out and even now I keep going back to it once in a while and this time I paid for this shit. And after so many playthroughs I can say that this is one of my favourite games of all time and you'd be crazy to not give this a go.",1
Positive,"Here is my opinion about Dark Souls III after almost 200h on this game. (Still playing)Combat: 9.5/10 The combat formula still works and it is super addictive. After getting used to it, for a new player, you will find your self ""dancing"" around mobs which makes the game feel like an arcade hack & slash experience.Kinda punishing at some points (not even close to dark souls 1) and very rewarding.Atmosphere: 8/10The atmosphere of the game is pretty good, dark, eerie, pretty much what you expect from a game of the series.Cannot compare it to Dark Souls 1's atmosphere which was a fatigue visceral world of death but you feel pretty ""lonely"" here also so worry not.Bosses: 9/10The bosses are excellent! Amazing design (even for 2021), You don't need something like 50 wipes to memorize the move set, extremely rewarding and very well placed on the locations of the game lore-wise.Npc's: 9/10They are all brilliantly voiced, lines are ominous and dark with no small-talk or extras. They also add to the atmosphere, the mystery and the ""why am i here"" of the game.Music: 9/10Intense music as the previous of the series. Top notch placement decision.Builds & Items: 8.5/10Most people I' ve seen use the same starting setup BUT the game has to offer so many items you can choose from and almost none of those unplayable or non enjoyable.You want a super strength tanky build? You got it! A stealthy dexterity agile build to sneak up on enemies and backstab them? Mages with a LOT of sorceries, miracles etc? All there!Plus this game has the BEST armor sets/fashion of that medieval dark setting period. (also a good chunk of the armor sets seem to be inspired by Bloodborne)Level Design: 8.5/10No comparison to DS1 or Bloodborne but oh man, that was nice!Multiplayer: -/10Haven't played more than an hour so I don't have anything to say about the PvP aspect of the game :(Overall: 9/10If you want a Zelda type experience, on a dark fantasy world & try to find out why are all these things happening, with excellent steady super accurate combat mechanics, I strongly recommend to give this gem a try and by try I mean play it more than 5h.IMO a good game should have you captivated and be self-explanatory way earlier but this is a part of the story of the game plus a ""mechanic"" and you will not be disappointed in the end that's for sure.",1
Positive,"After hearing a lot about the series, and my friend spamming me every day to buy Dark Souls III, I gave in. I bought it. I expected pain, struggle, and a refund after the first five minutes. However, that's not what I got. I'll admit, I have a lot of experience in RPG games as I have over 300h in The Witcher 3, but this took quite some time to get used to. You'll constantly get destroyed by mob enemies, and even when you think you're safe, you'll get a giant tree that smacks you down. However, once you get the hang of it, this game is going to be one of the most enjoyable games you've played. There is no minimap, there is no saving and loading (there are checkpoints, though). There's not a single indicator of what you're supposed to do. The game has a lot of sidequests, but you'll have no idea how to actually complete them, so the wiki will probably be your best friend in the game. Multiplayer is a big thing in this game. You can either summon a white phantom, who can help you kill a boss (even though you should fight the bosses all by yourself, or you'll find the game too easy), or a red phantom, who will absolutely destroy you with his +10 Ultra Greatsword that he bought from Tesco. I'm currently going through my NG+ and I don't plan to stop playing any time soon, so I definitely recommend this game to you.",1
Positive,"Dark Souls 3 is another high quality Souls game with some minor flaws. The game is most impressive technically - the controls are very smooth and responsive - certainly the best out of the 3 Dark Souls games, and the graphics are a visible upgrade from DS2. The world looks gorgeous, expansive, and detailed, while still maintaining that dark, desolate Souls feeling. The gameplay is very fast-paced compared to DS/DS2, with attacks landing faster and monsters overwhelming you very quickly. Whether you'll like this or not depends on personal preference, but I enjoy the slower combat of DS/DS2. I'm also not a big fan of the travel system which is pretty much the same as Dark Souls 2, and makes the world feel more disconnected. Dark Souls is still the best in the series, but that's simply because any Souls game is such a unique experience that you can never reproduce it after playing it once. Overall though, DS3 successfully brings back the familiar core of the Souls gameplay and setting, while adding enough new things to keep it fresh",1
Positive,"Edit: I now retract my previous review, which is listed below. Currently, I recommend the game. It's a great game with lots of replayability, and has been going strong since 2016. I'm glad to see Bamco reinstate family share once again, which is why I gave the game a negative review, seen below. ""Don't buy this game now. Bandai removed family sharing 4 YEARS after launch to force those who got banned to re purchase the game. Hackers have gotten myself, and others banned btw, by dropping things in your world/running scripts. If they made the ban system ACTUALLY work, i'd say, why not? But as it currently stands, it's just a greedy move on their part to force the community to buy the game again, KNOWING the ban system is flawed. Review bomb the game into oblivion. They don't care about the community, or the people who've been screwed by the way bans work. They just want your $$. And $59 for a 4 year old game that receives zero updates? HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHHAAHHAAHAHAHAHAH!""",1

Positive,"I've played through all of these games. Dark Souls 3 is a great addition to the franchise. Has the most polish, a very good variety of bosses, classic souls lvling system, and updated visuals. This is the crown jewel on the head of fromsoft. Ds 1 might still be my fav. but it's hard to not have this as a CLOSE second. Well done 9/10",1
Positive,"Dark Souls 3 is an incredible game and a true hardcore masterpiece. It is a perfect example of inderect storytelling, with a rich and haunting game world, expert voice acting and a beautiful soundtrack to accompany you while you journey through this dark, dieing world. The controls are smooth as silk, and the weapon arts add many new strategies and ways to combat the terrible foes you face. Of the Souls games I have played (not including BloodBorne) I would have to say thatthis one is technically the smoothest, with very helpful features like homeward bones having extra options and many other things. Multiplayer is amazing, and once you get the hang of how the elaborate system works, many awesome experiences await you (except for point down). The game also has amazing replayability and alternate endings to achieve, as well as NPC story lines which all intertwine and that can change how the story will go. Overall, I would recommend this game to Souls fans, lovers of a challenge, and newcomers alike who want to experience the hauntingly beautiful, decaying world of Lothric.",1

It's a really well made game that deserves to be played, regardless if you played the other games of the trilogy. If you played the other ones, it's even better. Highly recommend it.",1
Positive,"My first time playing a dark souls game, I'm a huge fan of RPGs and when dark souls 3 got released I decided to try it out.It's different than other RPGs and sometimes god damn infuriating if you die on a boss you have to run a long way back up to it. there are no checkpoints there is something called ""bonfires"" they serve as some checkpoints but everything respawns when you die or visit a bonfire. The reason I haven't tried the game before is that it has a reputation for being insanely hard and unforgiving. That is mostly true, it is pretty hard yes but if you struggle with a boss or an area you can just grind souls ( souls is the currency in this game you get an x amount of souls each enemy you kill) and level up and then try again. If you still have difficulty with a boss you can summon phantoms to help you out (other players online). Dark Souls is different than most traditional RPGs, gear in this game don't give you extra stats or is upgradeable which for me I personally did not like. But you can upgrade your weapons and infuse them ( infuse is sort of like enchant) One thing that I really didn't like is the lack of story, what I enjoy most in RPGs is the story, the sidequests or if you stumble upon a book which tells another story if you stumble upon a sword hidden deep in the water then finding out why it was there. It does have sidequests but it is impossible to figure out them yourself when you are first playing, you have maybe 3 or 4 sidequests and the story was short and thin I mean really short. I had to do 2 playthroughs to get all the sidequests done and it left me really unsatisfied. The reason I had to do 2 playthroughs is that if you do one action they might leave and you have no idea why. You have to look it up there is no way of knowing when first playing. The music during the boss fights are really cool and amazing, and the boss fights are really satisfying killing a boss for yourself after your 10th try and then seeing them go down is really satisfying. The ending to this game was a short 1-minute cutscene and that's it, there are 3 endings to the game and they are just as short I completed them all every single one of them left me unsatisfied. But despite all that I still like the game very much, the areas are nicely designed and the bosses are really cool I didn't find the game that hard but at times I did struggle. But I do have to admit I do like the more traditional RPGs like the Witcher series.",1
Positive,"It is a Dark Souls game, and it is more of it. It is more like Dark Souls 1 in its mechanics than Dark Souls 2. Not only that, but there are very memorable moments in the game already, and I have only played 10 hours in. there is also far more lore to this than Dark Souls 2 presented.With that said, there are a lot of reports of game crashes and bugs. So far, I have not encountered any (thankfully) and thus my experience has been free of such issues. I suspect it has something to do with me not upgrading my graphics drivers for some time now.If you have a strong computer that meets the recommended requirements, it is suggested you get this game.",1
Positive,"Faster paced than the first two games, kind of like Bloodborne gameplay-wise. The level design is more linear than the first game but it still has it's share of optional areas, bosses and items you reach by exploring.The graphics look gorgeous in my opinion and i found myself taking a lot of screenshots, which i never do. I would say the game is kind of easier than the first two games but that's probably because i played them first and gained some experience. However i would not advise people to play this first because then the first two games would feel very clunky and that may turn some people off from them.I really have not much to say about it because the points i made in the review for the first game are mostly valid in this game as well. It's still the good old amazing Dark Souls experience. (Though i would say that i like the first game a lot more).",1
Positive,"My friend and I starting playing this a today, and everything was going well, then I summed him into my world, what he hadn't know is that I dry fingered. So in about 30 seconds we had two phantoms ontop of us. The first one was a so called ""Mad pahntom"" and the other was a red. The mad phantom toyed around with us but we did kill them and the red invader. After about 45 minutes, the same ""mad phantom"" invaded us again, this time we left them alone, soon another red invader came into my world and my friend died from him, so I was alone with the mad phantom and the red invader, the mad phantom that I killed previously walked infront of me and blocked the red invader from attacking me. That mad phantom saved my life today, and I will never forget.10/10 I got the one nice mad phantom in Dark Souls 3",1

Positive,"Was worried of how the game would turn out, considering how Dark Souls 2 was; but now that Miyazaki is back it's better than I expected. Pros:Fucking beautiful gameA lot of callbacks to the old gamesWeapon variety Armor varietyGood NPC'sGood bossfightsNot overwhelmingly difficult Lots of gameplayThe SunBros are backRage InducingCons:Hard to run well without a great computerRolling is slighly less effectiveCatacombs are back3 Swamp areasRage InducingOverall Rating: 9/10Feels like a genuine souls game that didn't hold back. The game feels great and is really immersive with great lore that's fun to try and dig into. Despite that the rating was put down a little bit due to quite a bit of reused textures and some areas felt (just a little) half-assed, though not many felt that way. Great game though, I highly reccomend it; especially if you're souls a fan.",1
Positive,"Dark Souls III es el tercer y ltimo t tulo de la franquicia emblema de acci n cuasi-dungeon crawler en tercera persona de FromSoftware, publicado en 2016 por Bandai Namco y adoptando un ritmo ligeramente m s veloz que en t tulos anteriores, posiblemente gracias a lo aprendido desarrollando Bloodborne.Es un juego muy reiterativo, otra vez. A grandes rasgos no se diferencia de Demon's Souls, Dark Souls, Dark Souls 2 y Bloodborne, por tanto vas volver a ver las mismas animaciones, combate met dico, kinestesia, din mica jugable (relativo a escenarios y enemy placement), multijugador y, en t rminos generales, el mismo planteamiento. Y esto es importante criticarlo.Sin embargo lo hace todo tan bien que cuesta quejarse. La m stica de su fantas a oscura es fascinante y los combates (salvo un par) son un examen de lo aprendido por el camino. Nada de esto es nuevo, ni siquiera los m ritos de la ejecuci n de estos planteamientos, pero eso no le resta valor.Ah, y los DLCs son excelentes, en especial The Ringed City. Muy por encima del juego base. En conclusi n? Su mayor defecto es ser un derivado y no un juego propio, pero no puedo ignorar la belleza de sus escenarios o la extravagancia de la m sica o de sus jefes.",1
Positive,"This game is one of the most intersting ang thoughtfully crafted games out right now that offers you a variety of playstyles that are actually effective and fun to play as. The combat is the closest a game has gotten to recreating the raw emotions and fear one would feel while in a sword fight to the death, it's great. The game world is just as well made, every corner offers new enimies in varied groups, and a fair share of ambushes and traps, and boss battles that make you learn enemy movesets and call on phantom summons to help you fight. It is hard as shit, but if you learn the layout and enemy moves it becomes a task that is more doable and rewardiung to complete. This is a perfect game if you wanna just burn weeks away at a time.",1
Positive,the best souls after bloodborn,1
Positive,It's like bloodborne with shields,1
Positive,"If Dark Souls 2 wasnt fast enough for you maybe Dark Souls 3 is - its like baby between bloodborne & DS2 cutting itself out of the womb with a greatsword enchanted with dark magic essentially. It has fixed lot of the issues i had with Dark Souls 2, such as lack of shops to sell items to, better hub zone, faster combat, better graphics and better multiplayer system, without stupid soul memory system.Dark Souls 3 is actually still rather hard game, but i slightly feel there is more casual elements (Or perhaps the word is convenient) to it like making the game more linear rather than this giant hub where you try to decide where you start (Like in DS2). Playing in multiplayer will drop the difficulty quite much and make it easier for you, if you can t do it on your own. Also i have to praise the things that they improved on the character creator. Lot of cool different weapons with different playstyles Game offers atleast +40h of gameplay along with NewGame+ you probably are bound to get around 100h Bunch of sidebosses and secrets to unveil Unforgiving game and offers real challenge Multiplayer aspect is great and fun Level design is rather great and you can see the castles and places from highground and the world is connected well in geographical level The game doesn t really tell you how to complete the side quests and what decisions to do at certain stages, which forces you to look wiki or google for answers and guides. You still cant compare the gear you buy from merchants to ones you are wearing right now, its not that hard to do guys :/ Story exists, but its rather hidden on item descriptions, the game does little to nothing to tell you about it and even bosses dont really give any dialogue (With exception of two). However the game really isn t about the story, atleast not for me Some Internet issues exist on the PC side of the servers",1
Positive,"The finale in the best trilogy you ll ever play.If you're checking in to see if Dark Souls in general is the kind of game you'd like, you're better off reading the far more comprehensive review of Dark Souls 1, which can be found here: https://steamcommunity.com/id/ninthbelief/recommended/211420/As with the other Dark Souls games, there s two things that need prefacing before you hop right in to DS3.First, make sure you have a controller available to play on at the point of writing, between Windows 10 and steam, any last gen and current gen controller can be plugged and played on without any additional setup (unless you ve messed with controller drivers before). The game is much more enjoyable on a controller and is designed to be played with one.Second, yes, this is one of those trilogies you re going to want to have played the previous games on. Thankfully, with Dark Souls 1 s remaster and Dark Souls 2 s Scholar of the First Sin release, it s never been easier to play through the trilogy, and it s worth every second of your time. Now, on with the review, avoiding story spoilers. As you should have played through the other two games, this one ll be pretty short, you know what you re expecting from a Souls game by now.Dark Souls 3 is the final game in the Dark Souls trilogy; it is intended to be the last Dark Souls game, and as a result a lot of the things you see and play through in the game are a result of thousands of years of history culminating at a key point, the time of the Ashen One.Gameplay, in a similar sort of way, is the culmination of all the lessons FromSoftware learned from Demon s Souls, Dark Souls 1, Dark Souls 2, and Bloodborne. An obscene amount of care has been put into making the game feel great to play, and with 2 other in-universe games of content to draw from, there s tons of familiar and no-so-familiar enemies, friends, weapons, armor, spells, and locations you ll be visiting throughout your journey. Many of the playstyles people choose for the Dark Souls games have been thoroughly enhanced for Dark Souls 3 there s flash sorcery for defending yourself with a blade of pure magic, pyromancy for shoving a flame into someone s chest and watching them explode, miracles to make your greathammer a Blessed Weapon. The game s RPG elements are absolutely nuts. All weapons have accompanying weapon art , which adds an insane amount of diversity to what is already a mountain of viable options for both PvE and PvP.Dark Souls has never been prettier, partly due to the improvements made to the original DS1 engine for DS3, and also majorly because the locations chosen for DS3 are simply jaw-dropping. Bosses now all have two phases, accompanied by a soundtrack for each the music as a whole has never been stronger. Motifs across all 3 games are used, leading to some truly awe-inspiring moments, especially during phase changes.Dark Souls 3 treats most of DS2 like the red-headed step child, so there are, I would say, intentional steps away from some design decisions of DS2. Powerstancing is gone and is probably the one most will miss. A more visible change, as you ll see right from the very start, is that the story is much, much more intertwined with DS1. I personally feel that this is a flaw of the game, but if you re part of that popular bandwagon that DS2 was literally Hitler and DS1 was the second coming of Christ, you ll feel pretty at home in DS3.The PvP in this game is my favorite, although there are some long-standing issues that remain systematically even for DS3. Twinking is just as bad as ever, hacking isn t any more halted than it was in DS2, there s no reason for a host to progress through a level you re invading, and running straight away from smeone has absurd power. The arena itself is a blast, I d say fighting premades with premades in the arenas is some of the most fun I ve ever had.DLC (and thus the Deluxe Edition) is absolutely worth it, but both are separate from the main story so if you want to complete the base game before you buy it that s an option available to you.The game is worth your money and time. I d recommend it to anyone.",1
Positive,My first souls game and i love it!,1
Positive,11/10 would be a Warrior of Sunlight again. Praise the sun my dudes.,1
Positive,"My game of the year, amazingly challenging without being bullshit (Unless you're in the Irithyll dungeon)Great soundtrack, great level design, well written lore, loved it, and im looking forward to the DLC.",1
Positive,"So the current entry into the souls series. I played Dark Souls before playing Dark Souls III. Let look at how this game and see how it stack up. Story: For those of you new to the series, do not fear that you'll be the only one lost in the lore and story of the game. Most people are. Just know that you are an immortal being destine to die 100s of times. It is you job to hunt down the Lords of Cinder. Just leave it at that, it easier that way.Gameplay: You can use magic, shields, swords, spears, scythes, clubs, crossbows, bows, fists, and etc to fight the various monsters that appear. Use dodge rolls to avoid attacks, shields to try block attacks, or parries to deflect attack and leave enemies open for counters. The way you play is up to you. But you better be prepared to die a lot. Dark Souls have always been notorious causing many deaths to players. In each level you are given bonfires which act as checkpoints and Etus Flask (health/magic potions). You'll find yourself running from bonfire to bonfire, and then going back to explore the area for items and secrets. The enemies are tough and even when you return to past areas with an high level character, those low level enemies can still be a threat. One thing I admire about this game is how enemies can still kill you not matter what level your character is at. As you defeat enemies you earn souls which is the currency for the game, you'll use souls from buying items to leveling up your character stats. But the second you die, you'll lose all the souls your have on you at that point and restart at the last bonfire you found. So heaven help you if you missed a bonfire and had several 100,000s souls on you. This is where the misery of Dark Souls come from. But it's a good misery, it's like being a gambling addict and on a winning streak and letting it ride. Only to lose it all on and say ""I can win it back"". If that wasn't bad enough, you got players who can ""invade"" your game with the only objective of killing you. Not to mention you could go to other players games to defend them from hostile players or assist them in an area or boss fight. What I'm saying is that this game can be tough and leave you pulling your hair out, but FromSoftware have mastered the art of making a game hard, addictive, and satisfying.Final Comments: Dark Souls is an addictive and hard game. The scenery is beautiful and the music perfectly fit the atmosphere of each area. Bosses are epic to look at and present a unique challenge defeat. With players entering your game to help you or kill you; or just leaving trolling messages to make you go to your death. This game is guaranteed hours of fun and heartache.Praise the Sun!",1

Positive,"I will sum up this game by telling you my first Dark Souls experience.I got dark souls 3 and played it yesterday because it was on sale. Never have played a Dark Souls game before, I was vastly under-prepared.I considered picking deprived for my class at first thinking it would be an easy game and that it would make it a bit more challenging, in hindsight it s a good thing I ended up going with assassin.My friend got the game too and we wanted to play with each other but found out we had to solo the first level to be able to summon another player so I go at that.Going through it the game seems really easy and I consider restarting with a harder class. That didn t last long as I came up to the boss for the tutorial level.First I try some sneaky stuff and going around him, that didn t work as you can t open the door till he is dead. Next I try just rushing him and swinging my sword around, that didn t work either since I found out I didn t even start the fight and had to pull a sword out of him to be able to damage him.I pull the sword out and kinda just stand there not know what to expect. He then precedes to hit me, pick me up, throw me across the field, and kill me.I m slightly irritated but realize that I had no clue what to do and think I ll do better this time. I go back in there and frantically run around trying to get back to my Souls to recover them. I m kinda a completionist so I m not gonna let myself lose any souls. When I finally get my souls back I try fighting him but he s already gotten me low and I e had to pop a potion or two so I die quite quickly.I repeat this and start getting stuff down, I m actually able to get to the boss without taking damage consistently. I still get rekt by the boss though.After a hour or so of this grind I m starting to get the hang of it. Until I realize that s just not true as he turns into some giant tar monster thing after half health and recks me.I kept going at it for a long while but then something happened. I failed to retrieve me Souls before he killed me. I was furious. I threw my controller and went to make some pizza rolls.When I come back I considered restarting as like a knight since I already lost all my souls and have seen in most Dark Souls clips they are a knight. I ended up deciding against it as my friend reminded me that I have been getting items from the guys I kill leading up to the boss that will give me Souls. My friend had beaten this boss on his third or fourth attempt and was just farming everything before the boss whilst waiting for me so we can do stuff together.I continue to try this fight attempt after attempt and I ve gotten to the point where I can do the first half of his health bar flawlessly but keep getting killed by the second part. I m starting to get the hang of it, at least I think I am but in actuality probably still suck. I m not really used to this type of game since I normally play games like CS:GO, PUBG, overwatch, and Osu!.After about another three or four hours of trying this I m finally able to do it. I kill him. It s over. Then I see the bonfire that spawns after killing him and I m so relieved. I continue on and can finally meet up with my friend.Some of the time I spent failing at that boss my friend spent looking up how to do co-op stuff so he had it all ready. He joins my world and I sigh a sigh of relief as I think I ll finally have a good chance at doing stuff. Then someone invaded my world, kills us both, and we go to bed.10/10 would get fucked again",1
Positive,"Quick background. I have beaten Demon's Souls, Dark Souls, Dark Souls 2, and Bloodborne. I enjoyed these games, each for different reasons, but now that I have beaten Dark Souls 3 I feel it's the best work by FromSoftware.I was gripped by Dark Souls 3 from the beginning. It's great to see the franchise meet the world of modern AAA production, shedding its repressed PS3 and Xbox 360 derived skin for something wonderfully detailed. Early on the game's influences from past games show in its environment textures, but soon these familiarities were left in past chapters as I explored some of the most breathtaking environments in RPG history. There's great diversity here, and despite the game requiring less time for me to beat than Dark Souls 1 and 2, I felt like I had visited more memorable places.The boss encounters are dynamic, with multiple phases that prevent one strategy from defeating them. I had to adapt to changing conditions, and survive increasingly difficult odds that were the gatekeepers of my success. Some of these bosses had tremendous production value that inspired awe and delight. Each remained at a high standard, preventing any form of loss of momentum.In the case of both regular foe and bosses, enemy design is breathtaking. Enemies don't only look, but sound and behave in a way that brands the game forever in your memory.What I think commonly goes unappreciated by many gamers is how great the gameplay in Dark Souls is. Many complain about the camera system and other peculiarities, and while these hold it back from being perfect, I can't think of another modern RPG that makes me feel more like I'm swinging a massive sword, raining fiery hell on opponents, and clobbering foes into smithereens. It's something that is the result of meticulous work in all facets of production: programming, art, and audio. In addition to the high stakes and merciless of enemies, this tactile gameplay aids in making the somewhat repetitive nature of the combat enjoyable for dozens if not hundreds of hours.Dark Souls 3 isn't the most challenging of the series, and will commonly be compared to Bloodborne in this regard. For this reason hardcore veterans will probably give it a tough spanking. However, what it does exceptionally well is providing a balanced difficulty curve. This game doesn't suffer from the spikes in difficulty like the early games. While some players might see this as a negative, it's something that has required a ton of careful design and testing on FromSoftware's part, and for that it should be commended. Newcomers and returning yet hesitant players are likely to find a welcoming atmosphere, at least for FromSoftware's standards.Traditionally, the end of an RPG adventure means the end of my career with the game. Not in this case. Dark Souls 3 is the first RPG I have ever beaten, and immediately started a new game. You may now find me in the swamps and castles of Lothric tossing down White Soapstones to help other players take down the menacing creatures that inhabit this world.All of the negatives that I can name about Dark Souls 3, from its heavily derived influence from past games and performance issues, fall short of holding it back from being one of my favorite RPGs in history. If you enjoy action RPGs, it's an easy recommendation from me. The only question is a matter of if your PC can handle it, and if not whether or not you have a PS4 or Xbox One.",1

Positive,the game is fun,1
Positive,"Update 2020: I'd probably classify DS3 as one of my favourite games of the decade. If you haven't played it it's absolutely worth it.DS3 is my favourite game of the three Dark Souls games. It feels like they took DS1 and improved all of the gameplay elements, the movement is a lot more fluid and responsive compared to the quad-directional movement of the first game and the fact they got rid of the invicibility frame bullshit of DS2 means fights actually feel fair and rolling is less of a gamble. In my opinion 3 does everything better than 1 except for the world, it doesn't mesh and flow as easily as the first game's world did but it's still fun to explore and breath-taking at times. Certain areas can be a pain to slog though, Farron Keep in particular isn't very fun but other places are highlights of the series such as Irrythl of the Borreal Valley. The worst problem with DS3 for me is PvP. I don't enjoy PvP or actively take part in it so getting invaded isn't something I look forward to if it weren't for the fact From Software still uses P2P instead of dedicated servers and as such 3/5 invaders are always laggy as hell inflicting hits when they are no where near and never recieving damage from clear strikes that connect. I dislike DS2 with a passion but the ability to burn an effigy to prevent invasion is one thing I wish carried over from it into 3.Dark Souls 3 is a good place to jump into the series if you've never played it before as it's definitely the most polished experience of the 3 games but playing 1 first will definitely allow you to appreciate it more.",1

Positive,"Having 100%'ed this game now I feel this is a good time for a review.TL;DR:Overall, this game is honestly the best game I've played this year. It's better than the games I played last year too - and it managed to pull me away from Overwatch for basically 3 weeks straight, and I'm still not finished with it, even after 280+ hours.Very highly recommended, even for newcomers to the series. In fact, especially for newcomers to the series, as this game is probably your best way in to what is most definitely one of the best damn game series ever created.Long(er) version:Dark Souls 3 is the first Souls game I played that I actually enjoyed - I own Dark Souls 1 & 2, and neither of those immediately grabbed me like Dark Souls 3 did. I didn't have to try nearly as hard to start enjoying DS3 as I did the other two games in the series.Because of this, if you are a newcomer to the Souls series, I would highly recommend you play this game first to get a feel for the controls and playstyle of the game, then after completing it, go back and play the older games, which is what I am doing now.As for DS3 itself, I haven't played a game this captivating, both inside and outside the game, in years. The last time a game occupied my everyday thoughts this much was many years ago, back on my old PS3 days with Battlefield 3. I played DS3 for a couple of hours to begin with, and made fair progress. But - the moment I beat the 1st real boss you face, after the ""tutorial"" boss, I was hooked.Every time I put my controller down I was immediately thinking what I was going to do next when I played again. I put 60 hours into this game in my first 2 weeks of owning it - whilst also working full time. Like I said, I haven't played a game that captured me this much in years.The combat system is intuitive, fluid and feels fantastic to play at 60fps. The hitboxes are awesome - a simple search on youtube will reveal to you just how good they are. The rolling thresholds are gone from the old games, so now you can ""fast"" roll at 70% equpid load, rather than the 16% from Dark Souls 1.The graphics are fantastic and very well themed - playing on an Nvidia 770 4GB I can run this game at a solid 60 on high. Walking through one of the later areas of the game that is lit with moonlight looks stunning - you'll know which area I mean when you get there!The story continues from the previous 2 games, and is as deep and fascinating as ever. You can skip the story completely, by not reading item descriptions and skipping the NPC dialogue. But, if you pay attention and spend some time every now and again reading a few things, you'll quickly become immersed in this game (and series') amazingly deep and thorough story. If anything, I recommend you play the older games just to learn the origins of the some of the bosses and items you find in this game. If not, there are many lore videos on youtube, all worth a watch.The PvP is. Well, its Dark Souls, so very competitive and sometimes kinda toxic. There is an established meta Soul Level you can stop levelling once you reach - it is at this level you will experience the most varied and plentiful PvP. Invasions are broken, with the invader being at a huge disadvantage, but these can still be fun from time to time, if you get lucky and invade a good host. If you're looking for good, fair PvP, look up honour duels for this game and try some summoning rather than invading - I enjoy honor duels substantially more than invasions, but it all comes down to what type of a PvP experience you are looking for. Poise is broken "" working as intended "", so be careful when using super slow weapons in PvP as enemies with faster weapons will very easily stagger you and get you in a stun lock - not fun at all.The weapons are varied enough to keep you busy for a long time, if you want to learn and use each. Some weapons that were very good from previous games have been completely borked, but there are many other awesome alternatives you can use that are equally as fun. The armor is good with many blast-from-the-pasts from previous games, allowing you to cosplay as your favourite bosses or make some hideous monstrosity wearing only a loincloth giant fat armor.Character creation and customisation is also improved from previous games, allowing you to tweak your character to fairly deep measures. The music - oh man the music. Give the composer a Grammy, please. The boss fights in this game are awesome as they are (well, most anyway.), but the music really takes them to the next level. The music in the forefront of my mind is the track that accompanies the first Lord of Cinder you fight, but all of the tracks are amazing in their own right and perfectly accompany an already fantastic game.Overall, this game is honestly the best game I've played this year. It's better than the games I played last year too - and it managed to pull me away from Overwatch for basically 3 weeks straight.Very highly recommended, even for newcomers to the series. In fact, especially for newcomers to the series, as this game is your best way in to what is probably one of the best damn game series ever created.",1
Positive,"Dark Souls 3 is a sendoff for the series. Not only have From Software confirmed that the series is going on a break, but while playing it s clear that this is the end of the series as we know it. The game constantly references the games that came before it, borrowing visuals from Demon s Souls, Dark Souls 1 & 2, and Bloodborne. The greatest complaint you can level against Dark Souls 3 is that it doesn t convey a strong image of its own, as it s making you think of other games all the time. But as a sendoff for this series of games, that s perfectly appropriate. I didn t mind this approach at all, because the quality of execution is From Software at their best.This is probably the most consistently good Souls game yet. For example, in Dark Souls 2 and Bloodborne I felt the quality of boss fights was too uneven, and in Dark Souls 1 some areas of the game felt rushed. In this game though, the minimum level of quality is very high, and the boss fights are better than ever. It presents the sort of challenge I like, where you have to learn to read enemy animations to learn when to dodge or attack. Given that even normal enemies now have more animations than before, regular fights outside of bosses retain a high level of tension and excitement, even after you ve spent a few hours in the same area. Leveling up can only take you so far, so you re pretty much forced to patiently learn enemy attack patterns to win consistently. It s nicely balanced, where it feels fair. Most games like Witcher 3 can often mess up subtle details in how combat works, and add a sense of chaotic sloppiness. I m talking about things like hit detection, invincibility frames while dodging, how target lock-on works, and so on. The best games make these things predictable and dependable, where your losses feel like your own mistake, and not the system screwing you over. Dark Souls 3 is such a game, where you CAN master it, and it will treat your fairly. As much as people (and Namco) hype the difficulty, it s really only about on the level of Ninja Gaiden or Devil May Cry on medium. It s not a cakewalk, but most people should be able to get through this without going nuts. I mean I had more difficulty getting through Uncharted 3 than I did this.When it comes to story, the game is as obtuse as ever at conveying information, as you really have to dig into it to learn anything. Especially at the start of the game you feel starved of information, to an extent you don t in other games. So it s more of a slow burn where pieces eventually start falling into place. One disappointment is how there are things that don t pay off properly in the story. There are things put into the game seemingly because they thought they were cool, and not because the game is about those things. So there s a sense that the game could ve been even better, had there been more depth to the story here. But I guess we ll have to settle for it being merely good.Even though the game reuses a lot of assets from earlier From Software titles, it does so with good direction and intent. The world design and layout makes sense, unlike Dark Souls 2 which was more like an amusement park than a world. There you went into a windmill, traveled up an elevator behind a throne room, and ended up at the entrance of a lava mountain land. A mountain which by the way wasn t visible behind the windmill itself. It was a complete mess. Because Dark Souls 3 only came out a year after Bloodborne, I didn t dare set my expectations too high, and as a result it consistently exceeded them. This is the kind of Dark Souls sequel you d hope for after the first game, as it has most of the qualities that made the first game so good. One thing that bugged me is how every location has fixed time of day and weather effects. Every location is tuned for a particular look and mood. This would normally be fine. But because you can teleport everywhere in the world via bonfires, it s a bit odd to go from a sinister solar eclipse in one place, to a moon lit night in a different location, in the span of just a single load screen. I m hoping this is something they can improve in future titles with better technology, so that the entire world can change its appearance as you advance through the story.As the final Dark Souls game, this is a great way to end. This is just the amount of game this formula can take before running itself into the ground. Same goes for the tech they re using, which also feels like its played out its role. For every flaw in the game, there were a hundred more things I thought were just awesome. I had a great time, it didn t feel its length, and I couldn t be happier with how it ended.",1
Positive,"For the third year in a row, the studio has pulled it off, and Dark Souls 3 remains a deep, complicated, fascinating experience. Newcomers can jump in, old fans will experience lots of ties to the previous games both visually and lore wise, and if this is indeed the final Dark Souls game in the series, it went out with its monster arms swinging high! It s fitting that the end would come like this, not dead and buried but at the pinnacle of its hollowed life.",1

Positive,"It's Dark Souls 3. It walks around in the skin of Dark Souls 1 quite a bit as far as areas visited and NPCs, which can be disappointing or nice depending on how you feel. The speed of the combat is closer to Bloodborne, but lacks the rally mechanic and feels a bit out of place as a result, but it's still good Dark Souls combat and the weapon skills add some nice variety to choosing your offhand.Multiplayer servers are currently down due to a severe security vulnerability, but the multiplayer is goofy and fun when it's up.",1

Positive,"Can't recommend this game highly enough.-Performance: Well optimised. The engine delivers frames in a beautifully smooth manner, so 40 fps looks more like 45. Does require a 4 core CPU at a decent clock rate to prevent bottlenecking.-Art style: Classic Miyazaki, this is what fans of the original dark souls and bloodborne have been waiting for. Atmospheric and incredibly immersive.-Level design: Complex and interconnected, incredibly enjoyable. So dense that at some stages in the game the scope can be overwhelming, something I haven't experienced in a souls game before. It's a good thing.-Enemies: The enemy AI is intelligent and punishing, but not to a disturbing extent. Patterns vary greatly from boss to boss, and each fight requires the player to learn different tactics.Edit: One downside I have to mention is the texture resolution. It is apparent that the textures have been compressed, likely to allow consoles to be able to handle the game. It would have been nice if they gave us the high definition versions. This is only apparent when you move the camera angle close against the textures, and won't bother most people, but I am a bit of a stickler for this kind of thing. This is especially the case when they have the ability to use high definition textures, but just haven't included them.~ I'm not having any of the controller or crashing issues that some others are, but all I can say is that hang in there and hopefully From Software will address it. Don't let these horrible technical issues put you off what is, and will be a greatly enjoyable experience for you.",1

Positive,Magnificent. Even the fairly linear level design and predictable encounters/traps don't mar the experience over much. It's a game completely comfortable with its' own new ideas and the ones that came before it. PVP is still active and likely the best of the series. A fitting end to the Dark Souls saga. so when's Bloodborne 2?,1
Positive,"It is done. I m done. I finished Dark Souls 3. With all DLCs. Beating all opponents in the game with at least 4 different builds: Pyromancer, Knight (from Deprived), Mage and Cleric. Played for more than 400 hours. Mostly on Linux (flawless!).What to say? Well, I recommended Dark Souls 1 as a masterpiece in the past. And Dark Souls 3? It s all Dark Souls 1, *but even better*! Dark Souls 3 is simply awesome. The only thing to note is that again, From Software stories are hard to follow and do not unfold. Another point is, that some ways are simply too long. E.g. why do I have to walk back into firelink shrine to the smith to adjust my Estus flask distribution?Yet, the environment, the look & feel, the mechanics are simply some of the best.Sure, it s hard. Yes, it sometimes makes you cry. But then again, it never really is full unfair. You always have the idea, that you could manage it.A masterpiece.10/10",1
Positive,"I recommend Dark Souls to anyone with a spine and anyone who is looking for a game that is actually worth the money you spent for it. It does not hold your hand like all the other games out there. You won't be able to beat it without using your brain unlike most action titles. (batman/tomb raider and so on.) This is the best looking Souls title to date and really shows it in later areas. DS3 employs the same stuff as before just a little faster and with more aggressive monsters. I would say play the first before hand as this one heavily references the lore of the first, that and there is no respect for those who watch videos instead of playing it themselves. As with all Souls games, this one really begins on newgame plus. In fact they are usually designed for you to miss or mess up story arcs and ""quests"" the first time around. So yeah, adapt, ""git gud"" and beat the Dark Souls games or tuck tail and retreat to the safety of your hand holding titles.",1

Positive,"One of my personal favorite games of all time. This game is very punishing and doesn't expect for you to get through it easily. Even in just the first ten minutes of the game, you encounter a boss battle, almost serving as a test for who will endure through the rest of the game. There are traps around every corner, powerful enemies that pack huge hits, and many other small things that can tick away at you.The challenge is what makes the game so good, and the feeling of getting through it is rewarding. Many of the locations you travel to have amazing scenery and are based on the first dark souls art style (a lot of the original dark souls locations were based on real life structures). If you can handle the challenge or want one, dark souls is known notoriously for that.",1
Positive,"TL;DRLong game (If it is your first entry into the Dark souls series it can take you anywhere from 30 (with coop help) to a 100 hours to beat)Great Co-op functionalityLackluster storytelling methods (You get most of the interesting story bits through item pieces and gear sets)Most builds are garbage (Playing a sourcerer or healer is only really prevalent when you're playing co-op) DARK SOULS III is most likely the final entry into the cult following series but it is a great entry nonetheless, where the series felt weak in several regards to previous entries, DARK SOULS III fixes many of these issues and places a great emphasis on a fluid combat experience unlike the previous two games.e.g. dodging and rolling felt very wonky in Dark Souls 1, because you couldn't have omni-directional rolling in a locked-in state, which could lead to many ridiculous deaths, but in the third entry, if you die, you died cause you genuinely sucked major ass.PVP combat can be very annoying at times, but that's mostly because of the nature of Dark Souls combat, many times you simply dodge attacks even though you can hear the sound of you getting hit, or vice versa.Overall, the game is great, and I recommend grabbing it with all the DLC on sale.",1

Positive,"One of my favourite Souls Series game after Dark Souls I,It's just too beautiful yet brutal to play. PROS One of the best thing about DS III is the graphics, too beautiful and you can even sit on a spot and enjoy the view of the world.I really love the story that happens in DS III. Main storyline, Side Quest storyline and DLC storyline are very interesting and fun. The lore of the bosses interesting but most of them are sad and sorrow.Lots of interesting weapons and armor in the game. There are some weapons that are specially designed for PVP, and using off meta weapons against player will surprise them. There are not best weapons for PVE since you can use any weapon you like against them. Fashion > Defence, and DS III provide lots of badass armor for player and you can build any cosplay you like.Souls games always contain rolling and dodging, It's combat is just too fun for me. You can level up to Lv802, switching playstyle as you wish, and rebirth(respec/relocate) up to 5 times per character. Feels good to parrying and backstabing enemies. CONS The only bad things I found in DS III is PVP. The delay in PVP is very sucks since sometimes you thought you dodge the attack but it hit you anyway. Sometimes you see enemy player sliding towards you instead of running. Really hope FROM could fix this issue. Invasion is not fun anymore. Most of the time they just keep running away from you and waste your time. Even invaders themself also keeps running away. But I still love the game anyway, just can't stop playing it. Definitely recommend to anyone out there who loves RPG. 9.9/10",1

You have to find the pieces on your own, in every aspect of this fascinating experience.Take the plunge, it's a journey you will never forget.",1
Positive,"Dark Souls III is a solid addition to the series. It does seem to wallow in itself from time to time, leaning heavily on referencing past installments but I think that s heavily tied into the theme and purpose of this iteration. It s a definite treat for fans of the series as it s more of the same but with enough novelty to keep them invested and it s a bit more accessible and with a more gradual difficulty curve so new players don t feel alienated. The only thing that remains for me to do right now is to finish the game and then try to remember what life was like before. Oh yes, and to git gud.Full Review Here: http://pressa2join.com/reviews/dark-souls-iii-review",1

So went back to first charecter and I have now doubled my level since then. So baisically what I'm saying is. this is the Dark Souls we know and love!This game is awesome 4/5 its alot like the originals but adds so much more depth to the environments, the story has a little better hook for me, and as a whole a lot of fun.Prepare to Die!",1

Positive,"Probably the best game I have ever played.It's challenging! Yes, it feels bad when you die 30-40 times to a single boss, but it just builds towards the reward of killing him/her. These moments of great pride and excitement upon completing a challenge are just priceless. Graphics are beautiful and artistically it's very creative/weird. Bosses are so cool and fun. Music is insanely good. It has some replayability too, but nothing special in my opinion. My first playthrough took around 40-50 hours.The negatives: Random PVP is not my cup of tea, but it isn't that bad, because it's easy to avoid (don't use ember or simply enter the boss room to remove the invaders). Co-op is super clunky to do and annoying, but honestly - it's bad to do it. Co-op just trivializes the game so much and ruins it. Same with summoning NPCs (phantoms). I would strongly recommend - DO NOT DO IT! Play the game completely solo, without summoning phantoms. I personally did my first playthrough without phantoms or people AND an ultra greatsword. It was very hard at times, but so satisfying.Overall, worth every cent!",1

Positive,"Great game. Not quite as good as DS1 IMO, but more polished in many ways.Servers have been offline for MONTHS now though, with no resolution in sight. There is no reason whatsoever to pay full price for this broken product.EDIT: Servers are back online. Good game.",1
Positive,"I don't even know where to begin with this game, but of course I recommend it. Fromsoft's most recent addition to the Dark Souls series carries over the high standard of visuals and amplifies it tenfold, this game looks gorgeous. It was an absolute blast traversing each of the environments, and I liked how most enemies thematically match with the locales they are placed in. The bosses in this game are some of my favourite out of the whole series, from the elegance of the Dancer to the aggression of Sullyvahn, every moment was filled with a tense urgency, even some of the easier bosses hold a potent threat if you happen to misstep. The game maintains the unforgiving-yet-not-unfair nature to the gameplay, it still provides a good challenge for veteran players, however, streamlined mechanics and simplified navigation make it a good way for new players to ease their way in to the series. On the subject of the mechanics, you can tell that the game took some cues from Bloodborne, DS3's combat feels pretty fast paced compared to the other Souls games, mind you, it's still wrong to have a blatant disregard for strategic engagement. The faster pace could just be due to better optimisation and refined mechanics, whether it's a good thing or a bad thing is entirely subjective, some people prefer the clunky charm of the first DS and that's fine. Be sure to get your summon sign placed down and ember yourself up cos this game is really fun with friends, cooperative play is beneficial for both easing difficulty and farming souls, as well as sharing insight with players that might not know a lot about the games hidden intricacies. My favourite part of this game as with every other FromSoft Souls game is the delivery of the lore through item descriptions, inscriptions within the environments and employment of show-don't-tell methods, and the mellow yet empowering orchestra makes for a fitting soundtrack to accompany your entire journey. Last good thing I wanna mention is the more streamlined navigation of the menus, makes it easier than ever for those true to the Fashion-Souls way to navigate all the gear you'll end up acquiring. Whilst I have a lot of good things to say about the game, I don't wanna be positively biased, so here are some things I personally didn't like. The combat could be a put-off to those who prefer DS1 due to the less authentically sluggish feel, like I said, this game took more cues from Bloodborne, giving the character a separate levelling branch for equip-load also seemed a little unecessary. Another hit-or-miss feature is the abundance of fanservice, whilst it's fun for the vets to see returning mechanics and NPCs/enemies, it did start to feel a little distracting at times, but this is another entirely subjective critique. The only other qualms I had was the less intricate connection of each part of the world, sections of each area felt a lot more linear and was more about creating loops than actually weaving each zone together (it's massively outshined by the interconnection of DS1), my last qualm is that some of the NPC side quests were a little too obscure, so those going for a completion run should beware, whilst I'd usually advise against guides, if you think you've missed major points in a characters quest then it wouldn't hurt to look up a walkthrough since some of the requirements are pretty damn easy to miss out on. Overall, I had a lot of fun, playing through with my friend, discovering all the optional areas and bosses which despite having the choice of skipping them entirely still have a staggering amount of detail poured into them, it truly is incredible seeing the craftsmanship of the environments and tone. FromSoft, you did not disappoint. Now to dig my claws into the DLCs.*ENDGAME SPOILER, STOP READING NOW IF YOU WISH TO AVOID*The final boss being an emalgamation of the DS1 base classes with mechanics carried over from the first Chosen Undead in the form of the Soul Of Cinder was an incredible final boss to finish the series, and brings the whole story full-circle, having his second phase inherit the moveset of Gwyn, the final boss of the first Dark Souls, was a moving moment as the remastered theme kicked in, it was a brilliant end to a brilliant series and honestly I can't think of any way they could've made it better.",1

It is difficult at first, very much so but with time you learn to appreciate the pacing, the lore and story told within descriptions of items and placement of enemies. You'll discover how and why locations look how they do with vaatividyas videos and end up contemplating who's the real vilain and which ending is really the good one. After all that, and if you chose to play online (which is great for coop with buddies and strangers alike) you'll be greeted by red and purple spirits. They might guide you, give you gifts or just plain murder you. But this game is about not giving up, as all dark souls are. ""There is no game over screen, only 'you died' screen"". So if you chose to join. You might end up like me. Randomly picking up the game on sale, falling in love with it and wasting more than a thousand hours of your life invading lonely hosts and 4 man gank squads alike.

Bosses will either kill you in one fell BS swoop becuz you said in your head ""can we please hurry this up"" and went for 3 attacks insrtead of the normal two.4. HYPER ARMOR is retarded remove it please. it turns every PVP encounter with a greatsword into a stamina guessing game with lucky hits thrown in. :)5. Faith and Intelligence spells are ripperoni unless ganking. (PVP only)6. Gankers you never have the privilege to point down. Its just like bruh come on 3v1 really and i suck at this game? a. if invaders taunt or throw dung pies that aSS is all game boy hecking lay him with the spin point down.7. For the love of God please make titanite chunks have a higher drop rate.8. King of storms, fight with camera not boss, fire move is close to undodgebale.9. So many fighter .pl wannabes.10. Why do i get one attempt with siegward in dark souls 1, but unlimited when helping anri fight Aldrich or sirris fight her ganked victims. Punishment?11. Holy shnikes dying is hella nnoying and I only seem to die when i have a junk ton of souls. (personal)12.

Positive,"What will I say after completing Dark Souls 3? The game is excellent, but I do not recommend it to all fans of ""light fantasy"". This game suppresses the atmosphere of a dark and dying world, where any story can end in your tears. Complexity is the hallmark of the SOULS series. (Network components are high, graphics are good, recommend to anyone who wants to immerse themselves in the dark story of dark souls . ^ _ ^",1
Positive,"After Spending a few months playing this game i have come to many different conclusions. I love this game!It's beautiful and gob-smacking, the animations are fluid and quick. Areas are challenging if you don't know what you are doing and its brilliant, i just simply cannot get enough of this game. The boss's are memorable, so are the areas which you can explore, the voice acting is amazing and the music, it's an orgasm for the ears. It's an absolute breathtaking game and i love it.Although it may be an epic game and awesome to play, i do have some concerns.My problem is invasions, and i know, i know, you're going to say ""Pvp isn't suppose to be fair."" and all that crap but there are genuine problems that a majority of you will agree on, I have some ideas on how it should be.The whole point of invasions are suppose to be fun and enjoyable, but it's facing more then 2-3 people if you're the invader, okay, i can agree with that if you are desperate for help but really that many people is simply not needed, at all, the whole point of the invasion system should be to enhance the difficulty for said host, with 2-3+ people, where is the challenge? The souls series are based off challenging difficulty and with that many people there might as well be an ""easy mode"". or even a ""Beginner mode""When you, the invader are faced up with them people with 3+ phantom, you got no backup you may as well crystal out. Not only that but all the people at said area and they just linger around the bonfire, with your 2-4 bodyguards with their heads up the hosts ass. Overall i can forgive all that, that's right, Invasions ain't suppose to be fair, and you should have to fight at least the host +1, maybe +2 phantom('s) (If you can play smart.), BUT, (Now this is what really gets to me!). If you kill the phantoms, the host has the power to summon them an unlimited amount of times and chooses not to fight you at all without a helper, which is unbelieveably stupid, and down right pethetic, It's really bad game design, expecialy when the host is 1) A higher level then you. 2) Has more heals then you. 3) Way more better then you at Pvp 4) has 30% more health then you. It renders the invasion system completely useless and not fun at all. DarkSouls2 was more forgiving in this matter, if that phantom died, you COULD NOT summon that same guy again untill either you died or you rested at the bonfire, yeah sure it resetted the NPC's but that was but a small price to pay for the back up you needed, and looking back, i loved that feature. Back to DarkSouls3, this time the wolf covinant, and the aldrich covinant, they are awesome don't get me wrong, but when im playing solo trying to make my way through (This has happened to me loads of times.) i get 2-3 watchdogs or aldrich faithful invade me, when you say ""Invasions ain't suppose to be fair"" you actualy being a hypocrite. Oh the Irony. The point of invasions is to have fun and really, it's not. In DarkSouls2 there was always the suspence of the possiblility to be invaded, you were always on edge and alert, and you needed to be prepared and DarkSouls3 takes that brilliant, brilliant mechanic, and takes a shit on it, then proceeds to smother that shit over it's face while laughing histericaly.Overall It's a fantastic game and beautiful, it's an absolute thumbs up for me, it's not perfect but with certain fix's, it's really has the potential to be perfect. I can almost taste how perfect it would be if the invasion system wasn't as flawed.",1
Positive,Not as hard as people say; or atleast i was just having a lot of fun and not realizing i was dying.,1
Positive,"I can't recommend this game highly enough. It's genuinely, in my opinion, one of the best games of the past decade. It is punishing but fair. It makes every little accomplishment feel amazing. The challenge of this game is part of what makes it so fun. You gradually learn how to fight, and progress from struggling to fight little dogs to killing literal gods. The atmosphere is so dense and rich. The game itself looks amazing (look up screenshots of Irithyll of the Boreal Valley for some stunning examples). Each region has its own distinct enemies and style, most of which are engaging and enjoyable. (Except the Irithyll Dungeon with those stupid jailers -_- )The story and plot is very bleak and dark, but in a refreshing and captivating way. It isn't thrust in your face like many modern titles do. It's dripped to you in subtle little hints in such a way that you gradually piece together what is happening in this miserable world you find yourself in. Being able to pick up on little hints rather than having a massive sign with neon lights pointing at every plot point is a smart way to reward exploration, and really helped me to immerse myself in the world.Compared to DS1, it feels more responsive, less buggy, more pretty and more well designed overall. One gripe is it is definitely slightly more linear than previous titles in the series, but that is in a way a trade off, as this game is able to balance itself far better than DS1 was (particularly in the end game) and doesn't have a massive drop off in quality at any points.It's freaking great, not a tonne more I can really say at this stage.Jeez dude just play the game already I'm gushing far too much.",1

Positive,"A great game, like all the previous Souls/Borne games. Actually the first game where I was able to put together a good part of the story without help from VaatiVidya (and that's kinda saying something as I love story, but want it kinda thrown in my face just enough that I'll look for the rest if it really intrigues me). Combat is just as fluid as ever (if not more so). By and By worth a buy! Bought the season pass edition (whatever it's called) 3 weeks before the game released TWICE! (one for me and the other for a friend). Still worth every penny and I would still throw them more (not much more considering I did pay 170ish dollars but more still the same.) One of the few games I have actually enjoyed and continued to play till the very end (just not the DLC's yet because 600 steam games and I've only beaten like 30 of em.). Also this game made me cry when it not only killed one of my favorite NPC's, and yet another as I watched in horror (on my first play through of course) as my character in a cutscene killed my other favorite NPC. Both of which caused me to immediately play through the game a second time to make sure they lived (after looking at a guide of course ;). Now everyone has had their (sorta) happy ending and FromSoftware has all my money. Thanks FROM!",1

Positive,"So I boot up my eMachine W3653 and after waiting 15 minutes for steam to load I see that the sequel to my favorite game of all time DARK SOULS II was just released, DARK SOULS III, directed by the great Miyazaki himself. Now I could tell from the trailer that it's got swords, armor, and enemies, and Kiki's Delivery Service just happens to be my favorite animated film of all time, so I knew I had to check it out. So I download the game, open it up, and, just wow. It's so great. The title screen is wonderful. It's similar in style to the title screens of it's two predecessors, however with a genius addition - three ""I""s follow the titular ""DARK SOULS"" (I believe that this is to represent that it is the third game in the series).In DARK SOULS III you again strike out as the Chosen Unkindled Curse Bearer. You have the ability to choose a class at the beginning of the game, which affects what armor you start out with. The design of this is truly genius. Miyazaki has tailored each class such that their abilities reflect the difficulty you wish to play the game at. At the moment, there are two classes you can play as - Knight and Deprived. Perhaps Miyazaki will develop more classes and add them as DLC? As you venture through the world of Lordran once again, you will meet old friends, and old enemies. Siegmeyer of Catarina, Andre the Giant Smith, and Patches (we all hate him!) all return to assist you on your quest to slay the Lords of Cinder.DARK SOULS III is undoubtedly the most difficult game in the series. After 6 hours of play, I finally arrived at the games second boss - The Winged Knight. This big boy wields a ""Winged Knight Halberd"" (Which he has a 10% chance of dropping) and is really large and hits really hard. My advice? Don't get hit by this enemy. Instead, avoid his attacks and hit him until his poise breaks (stunned). Now continue hitting him. If you're lucky, he will die before he can hit you enough to kill you. Remember, in DARK SOULS, your fate is in luck's hands.DARK SOULS III has covenants. Something that this entry of the SOULS series is seriously lacking is the Mask of the Father and the Giants set. These two armors are iconic to the series (as the Chosen Undead is shown wearing them on many promotional materials) and I think that it is a real shame that they have been left out. (P.S. The Legend will never die! (laugh out loud)In conclusion, DARK SOULS III is a great game. I personally don't like it, and couldn't recommend it to any of my friends, but it is definitely one of the best and most enjoyable games of all time. This is due to it's hard difficulty, and because my favorite Twitch Streamer Lobos Jr. plays it. (TLDR: 10/10)",1
Positive,"DIed, summoned sun bros, sat around the born fire, got invaded, went camping, end of story.",1
Positive,just got past the tutorial,1
Positive,"Game is a lot of fun.And now you've got mods when you feel like the base game has got nothing left for you, i think for me that was around the 1300h mark. Just make sure to boot the game starts in offline mode, can be done in the settings of DS3. I am unsure if setting Steam to offline will work on its own.",1
Positive,"Taking its cues from Bloodborne, the speed of play has been dramatically increased in this latest Dark Souls outing and combat is a lot more stressful and punishing than it was in the first two games too. Relative to a series renowned for its challenge, the earlier levels contribute to a fairly reasonable difficulty curve, but souls (the currency that allows a player to gain items and improve their character's abilities) are kept in short supply and the hub area where they can be spent is locked away until a player ""graduates"" from the first boss fight.Whereas the bosses are comparable to previous games in terms of difficulty, they're almost upstaged by the regular enemies who attack with heightened speed and aggression at every opportunity. Long gone are the lumbering knights and club-wielding underlings of Dark Souls II, here you're frequently accosted by bizarre horrors including crystalline beasts, demented stat-reducing jailers, and crazed demons that will literally try to rip your character's head off!Aside from new features like the smart skill system and some welcome changes to how magic behaves, Dark Souls III is very reminiscent of past games in the series. The story concerns the four Lords of Cinder whose departure has plunged the cursed Kingdom of Lothric into chaos. Players take on the mantle of the Ashen One and must return the Lords - or at least their heads - to their ""moulding thrones"" so that the undead curse can be averted once and for all.Fans of the series will be glad to know that Dark Souls III does not sell out on the qualities that have made it so successful and admired up until now. The gameplay is still tense, the environments still inspire awe, and the fragmented tapestry that makes up the game's narrative will take many hours of decrypting in order to knit together.There are elements that feel a bit tired; it's only natural after so many sequels, but it's commendable how successful FromSoftware has been in trying to keep the series feeling fresh and exciting. The boss battles are an especially good example of this. Improving on the mediocre confrontations that characterized much of Dark Souls II, here the actual number of bosses is reduced in favour of providing more honed and interesting confrontations. Dark Souls III has bosses that set a new high for the series and each one is very different in look and execution. The variety here is bolstered by several good commonalities including interesting arena design, superb backing music, and dynamic move sets.Dark Souls III does well to introduce some circuitous level design towards the end and even though the more linear approach in the first half is focused and effective, it's fair to say that those expecting another vast and interconnected world like the one from Dark Souls are probably going to feel a tinge of disappointment. That's not to say that this is a small game though as you'll find Lothric to be a huge place that's absolutely brimming with enemies to slay and secrets to find. It may not be as vast as Drangleic was in Dark Souls II, but Lothric does feel more packed with content and it's a rare area indeed that doesn't feature a satisfying verticality to it.In terms of this PC version specifically, Dark Souls III is a success beyond words when compared to the ports of previous entries. The 60FPS action is fluid, the graphics are sharp, and the loading screens are so short that item descriptions will disappear before you can even finish reading them! Conversely though, there is a tendency for the game to pause slightly when picking up items and it sometimes has trouble streaming certain areas; blocking them off behind unsightly fog barriers until they finish loading. The environments are still well designed - you can expect to see plenty of ""gorgeous views ahead"" - although the game as a whole is rather grey in appearance and it can be easy to miss areas and NPCs because of how well they blend into their surroundings.My time with the PC version was smooth sailing on the whole though and I can only hope that future software updates help those players who have reported crashes and related bugs during the launch period.In terms of performance, it's important to state how well this game plays with regards to its multiplayer too. Whilst Dark Souls was more experimental and arguably ill-suited to serious cooperative/competitive play, the series as a whole has always been too good not to share and FromSoftware have taken steps to further improve the network code for this new release. Players can still summon human-controlled phantoms to assist in clearing out levels and bosses and the number of permitted players in each host's world has been boosted for more team-based insanity than ever before.Multiplayer has been a very strong focus for FromSoftware this time around and it really shows. The disastrous soul memory feature from Dark Souls II has been axed in favour of simple matchmaking rules (including a glorious password system for friends) that eliminate a lot of the undue frustration associated with summoning other players. The realms of PvP and PvE feel closely intertwined in Dark Souls III. Estus healing is quicker, combat is more nuanced, and you'll likely find a deluge of summoning signs and invaders in every new area that you visit.Whether they're the hostile red phantoms that want nothing more than to kill you, the gold phantoms that want to earn medals for helping you, or the mysterious purple phantoms (God only knows what they want) entering your world, the potential for player interaction is off the charts.FromSoftware has acted to make sure that players feel more secure in general though and Dark Souls III seems to be more protective of its PvE players as a result. Likely an attempt to curb trolling, red phantoms seem to be regularly, if not exclusively matched up with ""victims"" who have already summoned helpers into their world. In this way it seems that player invasions have lost some their non-hardcore appeal as a red phantom will frequently find themselves staring down multiple foes instead of just one. There are fewer easy kills to be had in this game that's for sure.There are signs of franchise fatigue, most noticeably in the number of callbacks and references to previous games in the series. At times the setting in Dark Souls III risks losing its sense of identity and becoming that of a mere nod to the first Dark Souls. Whilst a subtle musical cue or visual reference does hit the mark from time to time, there are too many revelations in this game that failed to surprise me because I found it easy to anticipate what was going to be another tribute.It's impossible to feel unsatisfied with Dark Souls III as a complete package though and you can easily expect a 50+ hour initial playthrough if you're committed to searching every nook and cranny the game has to offer. The game has its lesser points, but none of them are severe enough to stop it from being a fitting end to what is perhaps the greatest trilogy of video games there has ever been.Much like the motif of fire and embers; a visual that permeates the game's bosses and locations as much as it does your player character, there's a certain warmth about Dark Souls III. It's a familiar resplendence found in the sweaty grip of the controller after slaying a towering boss, so too is it found in the game's deep backstory, its beautiful environments and the mystery behind its many secrets and hidden endings. The developers may have gotten a little nostalgic for this entry sure, but I'll be damned if they didn't earn the indulgence.Read the full review at my blog [www.celjaded.com]",1

Positive,"""Long may the sun shine!""Dark Souls is based around the 'Souls'and such as a cycle between the Flame and Dark.""But then there was Fire.And with Fire, came Disparity. Heat and Dark. Then, from the Dark,They came, and found the Souls of Lords within the flame""-As Dark Souls NarratorThere were four kings(Gwyn the Lord of Sunlight;Gravelord Nito;The Witch of Izalith and The Furtive Pygmy) divided the Original Flame(Souls) as four parts.The Sunlight lord Gwyn created the most of thunder magic miracles and sacrificed himself to link the fire and continued the light amount 1000 years. Gravelord Nito created a cemetery world and he lived in there. In order to keep this world,Nito had to devide Death Souls power and thats the reason Nito is weak personally. The Witch of Izalith attempted to duplicate the First Flame from a soul, but instead created a distorted being of Chaos and Fire. Its power formed a bed of life which would become the source of all demons in the end.The Furtive Pygmy more likes human's ancestor (Pygmy in Dark Souls but Normal people in real life).Pygmy gained the 'Dark Souls' and sealed a part of Dark Souls in the Ringed City.'Fire is fading and you have to return the five Lords of Cinder to their rightful thrones in order to link the fire once more.'Overall, the Dark SoulsIII is about the kingdom of Lothric story and you journey through the kingdom of Lothric. As the Fire Keeper said in the end:'I am a Fire Keeper. I tend to the flame, and tend to thee. The Lords have left their thrones, and must be deliver'd to them. To this end, I am at your side.'I gave up the flame and dark world was coming but i still owned the Fire Keeper(Worth enough).Rating:9/10",1
Positive,"Excellent introduction for players new to the Souls series. A healthy mixture of gimmick bosses and challenging fights, dozens of secrets, character questlines, lots of different unique and interesting architecture, scenery, weapons, fight styles. Coupled with a lively PvP scene and a rock solid system for bringing in friends to help you fight make DS3 a thrilling and frustrating must-have. Usually sells for fifteen USD at major sales.

Excluding Bloodborne of course, can't beat that, atleast until the expansions for DSIII arrive, we'll see about that then. The game does have it's flaws of course (without going too much into them) but FromSoft has been doing a pretty decent job on countering them.Do you love RPGs?Do you love atmospheric fanstasy/dark fantasy settings?Do you love to challenge yourself?If yes, then this game is definitely for you.",1
Positive,"Insanely good installation of one of the best games I've ever played.Although I have some major gripes with major components of the game (The implementation of the poise stat, invading resulting in ganks 90% of the time) the PvE component is stellar. Lots of references to the original Dark Souls game, switching covenants on the fly, weapon arts, password matchmaking, fun weapons, all of this makes the game fantastic due to fresh gameplay and improved coop capabilities.Before buying this I recommend starting from the original dark souls and playing each game in order.

The devs probably intended you to fight the enemy in exactly that way. The combat is some of the best I've seen in an RPG. It's depth rivals or surpasses 2.5D fighting games - games that rely solely on their combat mechanics and offer little else. If you haven't found much depth to the combat you haven't looked hard enough. Do your research! Environment is jaw dropping on max settings at 2k - 4k. But, even an GTX 1060 or an RX580 (any GB version) can run this game at max settings on 2k. Frame rates are stable 60-50 fps. I'm very impressed. When I can save up the money, I will buy the DLC.",1

Positive,"I'll be rating the product on five categories which will then be averaged for a final score.Dark Souls 3 is the continuation of the Souls series into its final chapter. For those that don't know, Souls is a difficult series that follows the story of an undead individual trying to link the fire.Dark Souls III's graphics, to be honest, can only be described in one word. Breathtaking. You'll be whisked away to endless vistas of mountainous beauty, gothic cathedrals glinting under the light of a pearlescent moon, and sharp crags jutting out from the dusty ground. The graphics are fucking amazing. The lighting and atmosphere produced by this game is nearly unrivaled and the artstyle is stupidly good. Coherent and immersive on a scale only seen in masterpieces.4.5/5The gameplay of Souls can't really be simplified down to a mere paragraph as it is extraordinarily rich. However, note this: You WILL die. A lot. It doesn't detract from the experience whatsoever though- it rather enhances it. Each death is a lesson and you learn a little more each time you die. The combat in Dark Souls 3 follows a similar formula as the other games except there are hints of Bloodborne's faster pace here and there. It's pretty damn glorious to be honest and the many weapons and spells available have varied movesets and weapon arts that make it feel entirely different each time you swap out your build. Overall pretty fucking amazing gameplay. The lore is immersive as fuck as well and is as deep as the abyss. Better equip artorias' ring.5/5The port of Dark Souls 3 is amazingly good compared to the shitty port of the first game. However, it has one single issue that PC players may find disconcerting: All the controls are shown in console buttons. Nevertheless it's not too hard to learn how to play using mouse and keyboard but I feel that an Xbox controller feels much better (not something I say a lot) and as such players should use one.4/5Wow. Oh wow. Holy mother of fuck the soundtrack in this game is utterly incredible. It's a masterpiece. The game itself does not feature much music in levels themselves due to it being contradictory to the lonesome atmosphere FROM Software creates. However the boss music is absolutely incredible and many times I've been in awe of the beauty of the music and subsequently gotten squashed, lacerated, and defiled by the numerous bosses of the game. Easily one of the best soundtracks I've heard: It's grim, sombre and fits the atmosphere flawlessly.5/5The level design of Dark Souls 3 will fuck you over as much as it can. Enemies are placed in the most irritating and unexpected locations and the areas themselves are sprawling and massive. Do I love it? Absolutely. Games have long since departed from creative and scummy level design that is meant to screw the player over and it is oh so refreshing to play something that does. Damn good.4.5/5-I haven't even mentioned PvP in this review, however the PvP combat is really great as well. Just remember your duel ettiquette and don't chug >:(Overall, a grossly incandescent game that is fucking good.Net score: 92.5%",1

Positive,"This is everything Dark Souls 2 should have been.Still not as good as the original Dark Souls, mainly because the gameworld is not completely interconnected like it was in DS1, it is more linear, but the levels themselves have become much larger and more intricate. Save your estus because if you waste it you'll be left looking for a bonfire like it was an oasis in the middle of the desert.Also. poise. Poise should apparently be there in the game, somewhere, because a lot of items and skills give a poise bonus, not to mention armor. But it just doesn't work. I'm not going in-depth because there are countless threads and videos about this. what matters is FromSoftware's statement about this, saying it is ""working as intended"". I don't know how to feel about this but it's clear they fucked up on this one, somehow.Still, overall this is the worthy sequel to the original Dark Souls, finally, after DS2 and its ""expansion"" left a bitter aftertaste. DS2 in comparison looks like an indie fan-made game, and its lore sounds like straight up fanfiction. ""Well, what is it"" DS2 fanboys? u mad? fite me",1
Positive,"WHAT I THINK IS GOOD- I love it so far, but then again I loved every Souls entry, so there's that bias from me.- Died in the first 15 minutes.

GTX 970 and an i5 4460 at 3.2ghz. - The weapon arts is cool.- Combat is fast, not as fast as Bloodborne but definitely has more pace than the previous two Dark Souls.NOT TOO GOOD-No crashes so far, but there are a lot of instances where the game kinda stutters. It doesn't linger for long (you may not notice at all) but it's there. Not enough to hinder the experience though, I'm pretty sure I never noticed it when fighting the first boss (I managed to beat it yay!)-Firelink Shrine is a little drab. Loved the original's unconventional shrine and Majula's beauty. I know it's a nod to Demon's nexus, but that one was majestically designed. -I miss our cute Herald VERDICT SO FAR (Will update later)Buy it if you're a Souls fan, won't change your mind if you never liked the series.",1

Positive,"Highly Recommended!This game is honestly amazing. I can't say which one's my favourite, 1 or 3, but I've always loved the Dark Souls series. I've played both 1 and 3 and can't wait to play more of this kind of game from From. It's sad to see that it's the last one of the series but that only makes this that much more worth it.The Dark Souls series is my favourite series due to all that it is. The game has a way of gripping you, entrancing you not in amazing graphics (which truly the graphics aren't bad, actually quite good), or instructional guided questlines with a straightforward story (which again, there is a story, yet it's truly hidden and you must be a true fan to really understand half of what goes on), but in difficulty, punishment, and overcoming new challenges. It's amazing to see a game that some can finish in 1 hour, and others spend 200 hours, but both can get the same great takeaway of challenge.This game has given me amazing memories. I highly respect those who put their effort into bringing this game to us. Thank you.",1

Positive,"Dark Souls III is an engaging, somber and atmospheric, intense combat driven experience.At its core it is a 3D Action RPG with limited hand holding by design.You control a character from a 3rd person perspectiveThere are 3 core stats: HP, FP, & Stamina Running, attacking, blocking, & casting spells uses StaminaStamina naturally regenerates at a rate based on your attributesUsing skills and special abilities reduces FPIf you run out of HP you dieKill enemies to gain SoulsSpend Souls on gear, items, weapon upgrades/augments, and stats for your characterWhen you die you lose the souls you have collected and leave behind a vaporous verdant glow which when interacted with retrieves your Souls which you had at the time of deathOnly one death vapor can exist for any given player at any timeAll players can invade to kill and also come to aid in their and your worldThis is the most linear Souls game so far, but also the most accessible to new players- taking roughly 8 hours straight to complete the first time for someone comfortable with the combat system.The story is somewhat of an extension of the previous titles. You'll find a lot of references to all of the previous Souls games in the details.Compared to the previous titles in the series- Dark Souls III is much of the same thing with some refinements, cuts, and additions.Rough terrain, ambushes lying in wait, overwhelming groups of enemies, and death pits. Dark Souls III challenges players not to die, over and over again. This game can be as intensely frustrating as it is rewarding. The standard sword arts have been refined drastically and ""power stance"" dual wielding of weapons is no longer available to players. Weapons have abilities which can be activated for an amount of FP which have various effects, such as a special attack or temporary increase to a stat/attribute among other modifiers.There are checkpoints scattered around the game worlds various zones which you can teleport between much like in the previous titles. They appear much more often in this release of Dark Souls, than in previous titles, making the overall difficulty somewhat paltry. NG+ and onward is a sad increase in difficulty by merely increasing the amount of health enemies have and an increase in damage dealt.The major improvements to the core gameplay of the Souls series are especially apparent in the boss fights, they've been improved from the previous Souls titles by leaps and bounds with transitions that drastically change the bosses attack patterns requiring players to change up their approach from aggressive to defensive and vice versa on the fly.Sound design leaves nothing to be desired at all.The soundtrack and the atmosphere are absolutely perfect.Dark Souls III runs excellent on all last gen video cards and it looks beautiful though it is fairly CPU demanding in order to run above 30fps consistently.Online play can be frustrating due to the connections being Peer to Peer. The worse a players internet connection is the more likely there will be desyncs which will cause all kinds of issues and drastically alter interactions between other players as well as players interactions with other players world's enemies.",1

Positive,"So let's be real with ourselves. We were disappointed with Dark Souls 2, but were longing for a sequel so badly that we tried convincing ourselves that we thoroughly enjoyed it. Dark Souls 1 was a fantastic game that left a mark on a lot of people. Now don't get me wrong, I enjoyed Dark Souls 2. I put over 300 hours in to it, but it was still a huge disappointment. Now we have Dark Souls 3, and it's finally the sequel to Dark Souls 1 that we wanted. When playing it you can just feel the similarities to 1 with game mechanics and story. It also brings over the nice little tweaks that Dark Souls 2 gave us with armor aesthetics and such. Is it perfect? By all means, no. But you can't ignore the fact that it feels like a FINISHED GAME. Something that Dark Souls 2 was not. I'll be honest and say that I was a bit hesitant on buying when I saw a day one season pass, but after finally beating the game I can say that I look forward to playing the DLC and having hilarious Co-op adventures. And I can't wait to pump more hours in to this game.It also has something that Dark Souls 1 and 2 lacked. A GOOD FINAL BOSS",1
Positive,"-welcome home ashen one-ashen one , be sure to bring more soul's",1
Positive,"honestly one of my favorite games of all time. Easily something that I put over 400 hours in (across multiple steam profiles,) and continue to put multiple more into. Dark Souls 3 and its brother and sister titles are wonderful series that I can't help coming back to. Only thing that I can complain about is the cheaters in PVP. If you're planning on putting any time into pvp covenants make sure to download Blue Sentinels mod to keep yourself safe from soft bans. 11/10 game",1
Positive,"I feel horrible for that darkwraith that is trapped behind a locked door because nobody can perform the requisite invasions to unlock his room.He was imprisoned forever for our sins of using cheat engine to uncensor the word 'Knight'But ultimately, this game had the worst online mechanics in the whole series, so it was worthwhile.At least you can't go wrong playing single player unless you pick mage, and coming back to it from Elden Ring reminds you of a time when bosses were actually good.",1

Positive,very good yes,1
Positive,"In this review:I'm addressing the only aspects of the game I think are the best. For all other things you think the game has and what to read about, or a pros n cons type of review, you came to the wrong place.I had one big problem with Dark Souls 1 and Dark Souls 2. Neither of them managed to mantain an above average level of interestingness throu out the whole game (at least for me). They had great innovating ideas as for the storytelling strategy goes, being them based on an enviormental way of selling the information needed to understand the lore behind the events happening at the moment. We all know those games had a great gameplay mechanic quirk that worked all game long, but it felt really repetitive. whether you started the game at Firelink Shrine or Anor Londo, the moveset nor the general look of the enemies changed much. Don't get mistaken, the lore behind those in-game places was astonishing, but the picture behind was over used throu out the game. In conclusion, they both needed variety on enemies.Dark Souls III completly change that fact, and to an amazing result. It not only had tons of different character models for all enemies in games, they also had completly different movesets, forcing you to spend time or patience understanding them all. That, plus the new hyper bloodborne-type game speed, made this game a different type of difficulty. Before, after dying a few times to the same enemies, you understood there was nothing to do other than keep dying until you get how to win, or farm ultil you get the level to continue. In this game, the speed makes the learning curve really faster, and the enemies variety makes it more interesting than before. Basically, It makes failure interestingHope this addressed topic is of use to you. I tried to speak about something new.If you ask yourself whether to buy the game or not, do it. It is completly worth it",1

Always try first on my own a few times though.",1
Positive,"Dark Souls 3 is an Action RPG in a Gothic Medieval fantasy setting, with Japanese inspirations from it's Japanese designers.I'd like to start off by saying this is by far my favourite and the best souls game I've ever played ( Haven't played Demon Souls or BloodBorne though). It is a vast improvement over the previous 2 Dark Souls games, not that they were bad games, not at all but it's done what a sequel should do, and has (in my opinion) outdone both of them, taking the good from both. In this review I'll try go over the key parts of what I think will make you want to buy the game ( the short of it is that you should).This game's performance has been mixed for the most part, it's worked fine for me and I've not suffered any serious issues during my entire playthrough, the only one's I've encountered are the occasional stuttering or a few frame drops here and there.To clarify, my PC meets the minimum requirementswith;AMD FX-43508GB DDR3 RAMNVIDIA GeForce GTX 750 TiMy game ran at 45 - 60 FPS most of the time on High settings, with the occasional stutters coming from over the top effects ( A problem which was in DS1 too).Like I mentioned, I've had no problems that were critical, but some of the people who are complaining have valid reasons, for example if they have quite a powerful PC, but if you're a half wit who's got a worse PC than the minimum REQUIRMENTS, yes what is REQUIRED to play the game with minimal problems, then don't complain. And if you're someone in that situation looking to get this game, you might get lucky, but I'd get a better PC honestly.For people who have never played a souls/borne game before and you're looking to get this one, seeing as it's the newest then you may already know about the supposed 'brutal' difficulty, which isn't entirely true for the most part. It's a difficult game in the sense that your hand is never held during the game, you're given a basic tutorial at the start of the game, teaching you the need to know mechanics for combat and the world then you're told to go out into that world. There's also the matter of things such as a lack of health regen (to start with) which means you've got to be a bit more methodical in your combat and how you approach a situation, because rushing in and getting spanked from pillar to post will get you killed, alot.For players who are somewhat familiar with the game, a new feature was added called 'weapon arts' or something like that, allowing you to perform different attacks/buffs from the normal moveset of the weapons in the game. The range from simple guard breaking attacks, to ludicrously fast slash and dash attacks.The pace of combat has also been sped up, in favour of faster attacks and more rolling in most cases, which is similar to what I've seen from BloodBorne, which is good and bad, but for me it takes away from this medieval theme, with some of these really cool swords, that are just too slow in some cases.In my opinion the combat in this game is what sets it appart from other games and you can't have the game without it, so if you're not a fan of fast paced, skill based (mostly) action packed combat that will punish you, but will be so rewarding if you win, then maybe miss out on this game.Since the start, the souls series has been known for it's epicly sized worlds, with massive landscapes, enemies and bosses and it's no different in DS3, and unlike in DS2 the world is more interconnected like in DS1, so if you see a cool looking area in the distance, chances are you can visit it, but more often than not, it's not a direct route.Some people seem to forget the story of this game, because a lot of them play it for the cool looking combat or simply the challenge, but Dark Souls has a lot of lore behind it, even though a lot is hidden away and you have to go and find it yourself in some cases. In DS3 it's not just it's own standalone game, it has references, some big and some small to the previous titles and as someone who's played a lot of the previous games, I like how they've kept some form of continuity in the series. So if you'd like a deep, interesting lore to get into then this is a great game for that.The difficulty of this game needs it's own category, simply because it's a staple of the series for most people. The most difficulty comes from the bigger enemies, that attack aggresively, or that need to have their patterns of attack learnt to defeat them and the same is with the bosses. Now if you've played the previous games, you may have noticed how (again in my opinion) Dark Souls 2 difficulty, wasn't as hard as DS1, which I believe to be mostly in that the attacks of the DS2 bosses had somewhat better hitboxes (so you didn't die from as many bullshit deaths) and their attacks were more predictable and easier to dodge. In DS3, the difficulty is noticeable ramped up, mostly in the later game after you've gotten used to how the game works and feels, but Bosses and enemies alike are more relentless with attacks, and can chain a lot of attacks together, which means you mustn't rely on simply blocking attacks, as rolling now costs less stamina, so being agile is often the key to victory.During my first playthrough, there wasn't a boss that I couldn't handle eventually, sometimes you need to level up a bit and come back, or simply summon someone to help and I'll explain the online next.Now I personally have a love/hate relationship with the online in this, mostly because of invasions. Invasions are when other players, come to your world with the goal of killing you, the host. For me personally I'm not overly bothered that they exist, it's annoying in some cases such as when you're trying to get through a particullarly hard area, and then a bad player invades and only sits behind tough enemies then gets you while you're overwhelmed. Now I can admire PvP, when it's fair. For new players this is extra difficulty that just isn't needed, even if they have summons it can still be irritating (Summons are players the are invited to help the host player in their world, mostly to defeat the area boss.) You can however invade and be the good guy, for example as a 'blue sentinel' which are players, dedicated to aiding other players in need, and do their best to protect them from invaders. This for me is somewhat satisfying, as you get to both help a new player not get stomped on, and you get to put an invader in their place and ruin their day. A big problem with the online PvP is that, in a game where life and death is decided frame by frame sometimes, the latency issues are a real problem and it doesn't matter if you're like me and have superb and fast internet, someone with terrible internet will ruin a fight, because they'll be hitting you before their animations even start, they'll lag all over the place and all sorts, it's just not well optimised for some people, who still insist on playing and ruining other people's experiences. Online extends beyond invading and co-op, as you can see messages in your world, left by other players in theres giving hints (usually) and 'bloodstains' which show how other players died in that spot.Lastly, while it is entirely possible to play the game in offline, so as to not get invaded by players, this also cuts you off from help from other players, through messages and summons, which some people may want rather than total isolation.Sadly there's not enough space in these steam review for me to write about everything I love and hate about this game, such as the God awful community (at times) or the Beautifuly made sound track, but hopefully I've given you some insight to this great, albeit flawed in some areas-game. Definitley recommend this, maybe wait for a sale if you're strapped for cash, but this is something any souls fan should experience!",1
Positive,This game will put your mental strength and patience to the test.,1
Positive,You can cosplay as an anthropomorphic Onion in robes that swings a sword twice it's size with one hand.,1
Positive,"When I first began playing this game, (my first of the games) I had absolutely no idea what I was getting myself into. I died 8 or 9 times to the tutorial boss, but the next day, I defeated it. This game made it difficult to put down, and I found myself swinging away and enjoying every boss fight (except curse-rotting greatwood). A few hours later, and I have started a new character, one whose play style I enjoy every bit as much as the original character. The game has a steep learning curve, and it is one of the best games I have played.",1
Positive,"Personally I always hated games with confusing plotlines, hard to understand stats and numbers and just rpgs in general. But holy shit this game is amazing. This is my first souls game so you know I went in butt naked and in return got my ass handed to me an uncountable number of times but man oh man was it fun. I wouldn't call the game unforgivingly hard but it is quite challenging to new players. But never ever let that stop you from experiencing the game. Also people who say it is impossible to play without a controller are wacked in the head because I play with a keyboard and it's just as good in pvp. Don't let all this distract you from buying this gold mine. I'd tell you to experience the game butt naked with no guides but that's just me.10/10 amazing once in awhile game.",1
Positive,"This is one of my favorite games of all time. But be aware that hacking has been an issue for all of the dark souls PC releases. The anti-cheat system is at best mediocre and at worst actively harmful for normal players. It would honestly be better if the anti-cheat system was just disabled entirely and left to the modding community, who has been doing a significantly better job than From or Bandai for the past three games. On that note, if you are going to play online I highly recommend checking out the anti-cheat mods created by the community. Hackers are capable of ruining your save file and getting you soft banned. Luckily Bandai did re-enable to family share feature so if your account gets softbanned you can use steam family share to get around this.",1
Positive,"How would I rank this episode compare to Demon Souls, Dark Souls 1, and Dark Souls 2. This is a hard choise. On a technical stand point, Dark Souls 3 is the most beautiful out of all the souls series and by far. However, the game still suffer from optimzation issues on PC such as no support for Triple Monitor (can be done but requires a modification of exe file), SLI is alright, drops in FPS, etc. now story wise, well, not convinced about it. It seems to take place in between Dark Souls 1 and Dark Souls 2, so it is I guess a prequel to Dark Souls 2, not sure. The gameplay is good and controls are spot on. Overall, it is a great game but falls short of the rest of games in the series. Another thing too, the game feels much easier to tackle than the other two. So, I will still recommend the game :)",1
Positive,"never have I been more frustrated and simultaneously enthralled by a game. this being my first SoulsBorneKiro game, it at first seemed as though it was punishing for no good reason and stopped after I reached somewhere around High Wall of Lothric. eventually it drew me back in and I sure am glad it did. it may have partially been the hunger for internet clout in beating it, but the main draw for me was its incredibly layered world-building, cryptic storytelling, and tough-but-rewarding gameplay style. all of its incredible aesthetics had stuck with me even after I had written off the game in my own mind. this attachment led me to go out and get 100% achievements in the game and continue along down the series to do the same thing.after having played a small amount of Bloodborne, DARK SOULS II : Scholar of the First Sin, and DARK SOULS : Prepare To Die Edition , I can say this is likely the most accessible one to new players and I would recommend it to anyone interested in the Souls franchise. it has a bit of a learning curve at first, Iudex Gundyr may take a few tries initially but if you can surpass him then you are definitely ready to take on the rest of this game. you need to learn how to learn to play games like this. if you don't feel like your efforts are paying off after the first area or two, definitely try and at least complete a playthrough to see if you think this game is for you.while I had a tough time deciphering much of a ""story"" through the base game itself, watching videos from YouTubers like VaatiVidya and hbomberguy definitely gave me more of an appreciation for what goes into the writing and mechanics of these games. no game has made me feel this disheartened and broken as a person upon completion as this. The End of Fire ending was what I ended my first playthrough on and it was such a fitting and glorious sendoff.the brutal atmosphere holds no punches in these games and is entirely meant to wear you down mentally as you go through them. Irithyll Dungeon/Profaned Capital especially had freaked me the f*ck out with what they had in store for me. I HATE THE MONSTROSITIES OF SIN SO MUCH WHAT KIND OF WEIRD FREAKISH FETISH IS THAT MIYAZAKI?!?!my only gripe with the game is the difficulty tends to wear off once you start NewGame+. my first playthrough (NewGame) took me around 50-60 hours to complete. NewGame+ took me maybe 5-10 if even. once you learn the ins and outs of this game, there isn't much that's going to surprise or challenge you except the DLCs or PvP/co-op, both are wonderful to have fun with once you feel comfortable with the main game.just kidding, fashion-souls is the real endgame.all in all, excellent game and definitely kickstarted my interest in the franchise and FromSoft in general. highly recommend but it's not for everyone.9/10",1
Positive,"Generally, the worst thing that can happen to a games series is to run out of ideas and to continue going on only as a revenue maker (Assassin s Creed?!). If Dark Souls III is the last game of the Souls series, then it is a worthy finale, one that goes out with a boom. It changes just enough in terms of mechanics to make the gameplay feel more fluid and refined, while offering the best collection of bosses that sprawl some amazingly designed areas. Although its world may not be as meticulously built as the one of the first game and the future of its online component is uncertain as of now, it is a hell of an experience that kept me addicted for two weeks straight and offered more than enough quality content to leave me satisfied. Despite enjoying it a lot more than Dark Souls II, it hasn t managed to impress me as much as the first one did, but that s perhaps because it was my first Souls experience.On an ending note, I can t wait to see what From Software will do with the DLCs (expect reviews for those as well!), as in all previous cases they have surpassed the vanilla game experience. What s more, I m excited for the possibility of new Souls-based games in different settings that are built on the same design principles.Pros:+ Impressive artistic design+ Epic soundtrack+ Mysterious and captivating story+ Good level design+ Refined combat system+ Greatest roster of boss battles and the best difficulty curve in the series+ Atmospheric+ Good itemization+ Fun PvPCons:- Bugs from the previous games made it into this one with new additions- Some issues with mouse & keyboard- Linear world design with a few exceptions- Perhaps too much fan service- The graphics quality and graphics related problems- Little incentive to continue with NG+ and onwards- Weapons balance issues due to Poise stat having no effect- The lack of proper support for the Online component- Annoying lag in Online playRead the in-depth review here.[thegameslashers.blogspot.ro]",1

Positive,"It's definitely got problems (connection issues, hacking problems, lack of proper balancing), but it's a great time. Still play with friends today (160 hours and 2 years later). Dark Souls 3 is basically Dark Souls 1 in the Bloodborne engine both in a good way and a bad way. In a good way being that the gameplay is active and fast, giving you little time to breath and on your toes. In a bad way because storywise it boils down to Dark Souls 1 references in the end.Definitely fun, would recommend even more if you have a friend to play with for Jolly Cooperation. Grade: B",1
Positive,"It's not an easy game, but that doesn't mean you have to git gud. You can bum rush into hordes of enemies, or choose to snipe them one by one at a distance like the cheeseburger assassin you are. Combat feels extremely rewarding when done right, and there's many different ways to progress including summoning phantoms and completing sidequests with NPCs that might help you later on. Prepare for lots of 'ohshit' moments.Interacting with other players, even if you can't chat directly with them, was the icing on the cake for me. Good times were had with silly gestures and being tricked into an untimely death from deceiving messages. It's an interesting dynamic to say the least, and one of the most unique forms of online interaction for someone new to Dark Souls.",1
Positive,I felt like this was a really good end to the Souls games. No series has made me feel such reward with struggle. Amazing detail in the level design. Lore is fascinating like the first installment. The weapon arts are really fun and encourage you to try all the weapons. Bosses will have your heart beating like crazy as you get to the end of their health bar. And the DLC ended up being some of the best add-on content money can buy.,1

Positive,"UpdateAs time passes on, so does the hackers (I presume). I bet it's safe to buy now, yet always keep in mind, that you do NOT want to take gifts from people you haven't met, and don't trust.I'm not the type which puts a lot of effort into his reviews, but I'll say what's on my mind.So overall this is the greatest milestone in the Souls series. However, it's also the most troubled version of all the Souls games.Yes. We're talking about hackers. Now, it's nothing new with hackers on the PC platform, however what's been going on with DS3 lately is ridicolous. I'd like to refer to my thread at the steam discussions for more information about this.The atmosphere and general sound, is amazing. Especially the atmosphere. Have you heard the Firelink music? It's awesome, go look it up on Youtube. Now, now. I'm not much in this game for the sounds ofcourse, as it's the gameplays (and partly the graphics?) that really matters to me.The gameplay is solid, and is challenging like you'd expect from a Souls game. I personally don't feel like it's the hardest there's been, but that may be because it's not my first Souls experience anymore. What I find most astounding, is the online play (except for the mentioned hackers and modders), which consists of you, and other people being able to both invade, summon and being summoned into other worlds as phantoms. My 64 hours in this game, is mostly consisting of PvP. The variety and fun you can have, finishing a PvP build, and then wrecking havoc in other host's worlds is really great.Now, is the PvP balanced? No, and you probably wouldn't be able to name one game which has perfect balancing. however, From is doing a good job at trying to patch, when someone finds, and exploits an insanely good combo/weapon.That's it. Not a great review, but I don't really have more time to write this now.One last thing: Please for the love of god, don't pick up items from a person whom you find highly suspicious, or have seen hack. This may get you banned. To combat this ridicolous anti-cheat, do regular back-ups.",1
Positive,"I can easily say Dark Souls III is the best buy of the year so far for me. I'm already a fan of the genre so I can say it's probably a biased review, but the game's worth it.I've got many of hours pumped into previous titles especially Demon's souls, even with my experience I'm finding this title challenging and fun, also definitely rewarding. 'Git Gud or die trying'. I can quite easily say I think this is my best game out of the Souls series for sure.10/10 - It's very nice to play a title I can enjoy endless hours playing instead of jumping from game to game.",1

Positive,"i love my balls being crushed between 2 things that maybe even slightly turn me on, if you like torture and pain with a climax worthy of divine scriptures then play this game, you beat boss and you happy but fighting a boss is like bashing your head into a wall and using a benedryll as a potion every 30 mins until you realize an easier way to destroy your braincells and the wall.",1

Positive,"This game is simply fantastic! A worthy finale to an excellent series, albeit unfortunately the last chapter of this deep and amazing lore. Praise the sun!",1
Positive,"An excellent end to a fantastic series. Whether you're new to the series or a returning vet, you're gonna absolutely love this entry in the Dark Souls series. This one has more roots with 1, more so than 2. Combat is fast paced, enemies offer a decent challenge even if you've played the previous games in the series. I found this one to be a bit more difficult than 2. If you played 1, then you should recognize the references, and returning characters that make appearences. Small spoiler, the final boss will really hit the long time players right in the feels. Overall this game looks, and plays great, and remains a very challenging game for newbies or vets. If you haven't played the Souls series yet. Then what the heck are you waiting for? DIVE IN AND PLAY",1
Positive,"After playing every souls game (not including Bloodborne [for very long that is]) I can say this game is best left at ""short, but sweet.""Things that killed longevity for this game for me personally: 1. You can't be invaded after killing the area boss.2. Everyone and their mother's have enough estus to last them long enough that if you're invading a host, they'll most certainly have the advantage. I could go into this for a very long time, but I think the Dark Souls 2 system for estus was better.With that said, the game is still pretty fun and I enjoy spending time doing pvp and looking into the lore of the game. It's always fun to make friends and duel people too.Just not invading. :)Anyways, I personally really like the game still.",1
Positive,"One of the best game I ever played, a lot easier than the other souls game imo and the graphic nice. I kept getting back into the game because it never get boring for me.10/10",1
Positive,Its a very good game but my biggest critique is its not interconnected as other souls games in the series. imo it has better bosses especially in dlcs(dont buy this game without dlc its on of the best in series). also easier than other souls games but totaly worth your money and time.May the flames guide thee.,1
Positive,"its just awesome! Buy it. Its so challenging, but thats the fun part. You will definitely suffer and cry, be mad and almost quit, but the moment you finally beat that boss feels amazing! Although the first DS is considered to be the best, I would put this at the top, because its the most beginner friendly, still very challenging but leaves out all the annoying features that just make the game useless hard and uneasy to understand",1
Positive,"Very good game. Challenging, but in the correct way. Doesn't just give enemies more health or give them extra damage output. The challenge comes from movement. Expect to die to bosses and tougher enemies more than a few times until you learn their attack patterns. It's very worth it though. The multiplayer aspect is very cool. If you invade, expect to be ganked. You can usually find a friend to summon at bonfires that are closest to bosses. Deep lore too, if you are into that sort of thing. I didn't really pay attention to it.Voice acting is superb. Each character feels like they have their own personality.Wide variety of gear, magics and stats make for limitless build variety. I mean yeah, there are the established meta builds but it's more fun to think of your own idea and run with that. Mine was a Strength-based mage who can buff his Greatsword with several different elements.Level design is also top notch. This is something I've not seen mentioned much, but each area feels so believable. I wouldn't be surprised if FromSoft got actual architects to work on the buildings. They really are pretty.Speaking of pretty, the graphics are quite nice. I wouldn't say it's the best ever but it's really good. This game really nails atmosphere. The game runs exceptionally well. This is a game that I can truly say is a masterpiece of porting. It runs on max settings 1920 x 1080 at a rock solid 60fps on my modest machine (i5-4590, 8gb 1600 ddr3, gtx 970). FromSoft really did an amazing job here, and it's really nice to see a company that actually cares about PC and doesn't just half-ass it for the extra sales and focuses on console.Similarly, the game is amazingly free of bugs. I've only found a few.Every weapon and spell feels unique. This is something a lot of games don't do very well, but really every weapon is viable as long as you build around it. And you are gud.Sometimes, bullshit happens. I've glitched a few times and died. Fell through a floor, got knocked a ways. It happens rare enough that you forget about it but it's often enough to be annoying because dying in this game means losing time and progress, two of my pet peeves in gaming. I'm fine with dying to a tough enemy but dying to bullshit is just aggravating.Weapons and enemies can swing through walls. This is probably the biggest con. You'll have an enemy with a weapon that's longer than a man is tall and they are going through a doorway, when they do a horizontal wide swing. Common sense dictates that the weapon will obviously never fit, but this is dark souls. Those weapons find a way. Connecting to a friend via the password system is slow as fuck. It works but expect to wait around for the summon sign. I've spent 15 mins waiting before. To me, having online play be tied to a consumable item that's of limited quantity is kinda iffy. But you gain so many that it sorta balances out.A very small one that's more of a mild annoyance is that fact that you can't quit to desktop from in-game. You select quit, then are ejected to the title screen which prompts you to press start. When you do, you have to go through a loading sequence, which goes to the main menu then you can hit quit.Worth the full price. Challenging in the right way. Creative enemies that won't make you bored. Great depth to the character creator. Lore! The final installment of the git-gud simulator is the best in the series.",1
Positive,"I am and still terrible at this game. Keeping count of all my deaths. After defeating ALL bosses I ended up dying 702 times, but I will never forget the journey I had in this game <3PvP is a lot of fun! I love the fight club the community created!

Positive,"Elden Ring was my first Souls game and it consumed me. I got completely lost in it's open world and the combat was simply the best in any game I have played, ever. It was a joy to explore ER's world and it's still one of the best games I have ever played however DS3 offers something that ER does not. A continuous level design where the entire game feels like a very long Legacy Dungeon from Elden Ring.Each enemy is carefully placed and each level feels very intentional and well crafted to create a challenge of getting from point A to B but often providing several ways to get to B while also in the middle of my journey from A > B throwing in a wrench of a path to C.I personally feel like the level design of the Dark Soul games is where From Soft and Miyazaki shines the best and honestly playing Elden Ring's DLC I missed it dearly.It's hard to say this game is better than Elden Ring and I wouldnt go that far but certainly there are aspects of DS3 where it's limitations of not being open world often provides a more well crafted experience than ER. My hope is that we get to see From Soft return to a game that is not open world and the dream would be to have a DS1 type of level design. Either way, whatever they cook up next Ill be there to play it.As for DS3, game good. Me take big sword and unga the bunga. 10/10.",1
Positive,"Why this game has 5 stars for me1) The game is balanced to give a certain amount of challenge every moment you play the game (The game introduces invasions to players that have a phantom to expose the player to a certain amount of ""harm"", also enables the player to experience the ""PVP"" part of the game.2) The lore is self-interpretation, so you could just play the game for the gameplay3) There are infinite amount of builds (You can do whatever you want, tank mage for example)4) The game is pc-friendly, not requiring that high spec of a setup5) You can install mods but always remember to play offline.Cons:Currently, there's a new breed of hackers that get you banned for putting items in your inventory, remember to have a backup save file.If you just bought it and contemplating whether to refund it or not, please read this: Seeing as there are many that they think they have made a mistake and asking for a refund, I'm asking you to just spend 3-5 hours and give you a guide.1. Be PATIENTa) As long as you try, you can kill the boss, you get to learn more about the moves of the boss when you die, the joy of defeating the boss is more than the remorse of having defeated multiple of times. *Insert meme where you point down to a boss and saying that he/she is trash despite killing you 50+ times*b) Time your attacks and rolls, there are iframes when you roll. (Iframes are the moments where you're invincible or you don't take damage). Don't be greedy too much, bosses can also detect your opening just as much you can detect theirs.2. Don't be afraid to DIEa) Dark Souls is all about dying, as much as the saying ""Defeat is the mother of victory"", you learn your shortcomings everytime you die and you improve yourself. I won't recommend ""GITTING GUD"" since ""GITTING GUD"" just comes along every time you play. Even with 432 hours, I still die to dogs and miscalculations.b) The difficulties of the boss are subjectiveSome find pontiff the hardest and they find friede easier than him, vice-versa. It's fine, we have our own experience on bosses and you get to keep it for yourself.3. Don't be afraid to ask for HELPDon't be angry to ppl calling you a ""CASUL"", just ignore them, a game is made to be an enjoyment for the ppl that play it, not for a certain few. The people here in the forums are very responsive most of the time, but still, try to defeat the boss alone first, since, the enjoyment of victory is meaningless on an easy one. The ""Easy"" type of victory will be explained below""The boss Hp gets stronger too"" - The boss also gets stronger when you summon a phantom, so the element of ""challenge"" is still there, but the element of ""challenge"" is extinguished when you make the phantom do all the work without exposing yourself to a certain degree of ""harm"", this is what I meant by ""Easy"" victory.To counter my argument that recommends players to kill the boss by themselves first, there are also bosses that gets harder when you have a phantom, like Uncle Gael that slaps you on NG++++ and your phantoms really HARD, dies HARD and he gets 50% more hp for each?The point is that ppl have many ways to enjoy the game, and don't let other ppl judge you on how to play the game.4. INVASIONS are part of the GAMEIf you hate being invaded, play Offline, but you won't be getting achievements when you kill a boss. As I have said earlier, this game presents you a challenge every second of your playtime. Being alone is less likely to get invaded, so having one phantom out gets you higher chance of getting invaded. Why? Because an ally enables you to clear an area faster, the game tries to counter this by presenting invaders. Rushing to the boss fog disables you to feel the DS3 experience. If a boss is getting on your nerves and you really just want to kill it by yourself without any hindrances, I advise you to equip the Way of the Blue covenant so that the Blue phantom would buy time for you to go to the boss fog. You can always ""gank"" invaders. What is a Gank? Ganking is playstyle where you have 2 or more phantoms bullying invaders. But don't complain if given the advantage, you and your team still got defeated. DEFEAT is also part of the game. Also you can invade too, so it's a win, right?5. Always copy your SAVE fileHackers are prominent here, but ""HACKERS that get you banned are the worst kind. Always have a backup save file. There's a separate guide for that, I just don't know the link (Please comment it lol)6. The Lore is open for interpretationsIf ur interested in the lore, just visit Vaatividya on Youtube (not that he's the only one, but he's the most famous in this section)7. Giving back to the communityBeing helped is FUN, and helping back is also FUN!8. Have FUN!As I have said before, a game was made to be an enjoyment. As the game gets harder, your skills also would have advanced by that time. A game is a game because there is a CHANCE, and it's fair if you analyze it carefully. You just get USED TO IT. If you feel sad, fret not, my friend, for we were on your shoes once and experienced your feelings right now. And learned the enjoyment of victory over uncountable displays of ""YOU DIED"".",1

Positive,"Warmth. You feel at peace. The gentle heat of the bonfire brings with it an aura of tranquility that only the Unkindled will ever truly understand. There s panic within the calm, but panic is omnipresent on your journey; the stone from which your labyrinth is constructed. Mind foggy, you stare into the crackling flames, trying to piece together how you got back here. You died of course, but cursed ones such as yourself always come back; what got me? is the question on your mind. You ponder this matter; it was something blunt. Yes, blunt; and incredibly heavy for that matter. It felt cold, as death always does, but more so than usual. Ah, there it is, clarity; that accursed watchdog from Irithyll had done you in. He s a fast one despite his stature, and certainly unlike anything you ve faced prior. That mace of his is quite menacing and, though it looks unwieldy, he definitely swung it with ease. A fearsome competitor, a warrior befitting the title Heir to the Fire , but not enough to keep you at bay. You steel yourself and meet the entry to his domain, determined to make this your final visit. With a solemn step, you part the fog; the fire of battle ignited within. REVIEWDark Souls IIIGENREAction RPGThe love-child of everyone s favorite masochistic enabler, From Software, Dark Souls III is the culmination of a series-wide effort to break the record for broken spirits and controllers alike. From the humble western fantasy of Demon s Souls to bloodsoaked eldritch horror of Bloodborne, players far and wide have learned what it truly means to be brought to your knees. And so it s time for the main line s third, and supposedly final, installment to bring its best to the table. With refined combat, improved matchmaking, and a return to form in terms of branching paths; can DS3 make a name for itself among its eternally infamous brethren, or will it fall into step with its predecessor Dark Souls II and be known forever as the mark of a dying franchise? Objective questions like that can t be answered or assured by the likes of me, but I can make certain one thing; you ll die. A lot.Allow me to commune with the spirits that be and channel my inner VaatiVidya to discuss the story of this game. In DS3 you are one of the Unkindled, undead souls unfit even to be cinders. As one of the Unkindled, you are cursed with the dark sign; forcing to forever wander the lands, unable to die. [Sorta.] Against what has been ordained, the Lords of Cinder have not returned to their thrones; making it your job to hunt them down and bring them back by force; though things can t always be so simple. Considering the fact that you literally crawled out of the ground; you re a bit of a chump, and victory won t be comin easy. The High Wall of Lothric wasn t built in a day, and so too must the warrior be slowly chiseled from the base. By spending souls, you can progressively upgrade your character and weapons to make yourself more effective, but beware; with death comes loss of souls. If you die, you ve got to retrieve your souls or lose all that progress, and dying on the way back causes you to lose them forever. So, prepared to die and equipped with a sippy cup of Sunny-D, some blue juice from wannabe Oscar s corpse, and that wonderfully hideous face of yours; you begin your quest to become a lord-slayer.Combat feels satisfying. Whether it be with a hefty greatsword, a grand lance, or just a good ol mace; you can be sure that your attacks will feel meaty and effective. Straight swords sadly take dominance over all other weapon types as of now,but their boring playstyle will hopefully persuade you to peruse your other options. Almost all weapon types have been rebalanced to be not only viable, but interesting and fun to use. Weapon arts add a whole nother level of complexity to the system, and their addition is heartily welcomed into this veteran s playbook. Boss weapons almost always have a flashy, devastating attack; though they re hard to land. Other weapons arts would include stomp, perseverance, and spin attacks, but most weapons just have the stance ability; which allows you to take an offensive form to deal massive damage. None of these abilities can be accessed without the use of focus points, however, a returning feature from Demon s Souls. It s basically mana.Boss fights and level design are equally fantastic this time around. Boss fights are all very fun, but none of them are really anything new to the series. Each has two phases and, though it seems interesting at first, it eventually becomes very, very tiresome. I will say, however, that I think the final boss may be the single best Souls boss in the entire series, but that s just me. Each level is varied and interesting, each with their own set of enemies and hazards to keep you on your toes. My personal favorite would have to be Lothric Castle, one of the final areas. Multiple elevators and hidden doors weave in between the level to conveniently connect important spots and save you time. Each time you find a new shortcut, it s like a breath of fresh air; a great burden lifted from the weary shoulders of a traveler. The lowest point would have to be Anor Londo, a cesspool of all the things horrible with Souls level design. Giants playing dead wake up to assault you whilst priests shoot high-damage fireballs at you from afar. At the same time, two pseudo-human enemies charge after you with quick, powerful weapons; and it s still not over yet. Anor Londo is also home to the Alrich Faithful, the Bellkeepers 2.0. Two of them can invade you at once, instantly bringing you into an unfair fight, and I ll be damned if they aren't guaranteed to fight like pricks. Thankfully the area is short, but that didn't stop it from leaving a horrible taste in my mouth. [And the faint taste of swedish meatballs, strangely ]But here comes my biggest gripe. [Brace yourselves, folks, this one might shock ya.] This game is way too easy. Not easy for video game standards as a whole, but easy for a Souls game. Outside of my first run of the game, which was obviously blind, I rarely died to anything. Boss fights are a breeze; they re no longer dudes in armor, but they re barely a threat in most cases. Enemies have predictable attack patterns with easily noticeable tells, and the only thing that might really kill you is stunlock. With little-to-no skill, this game could easily be beaten by anyone, you ve just gotta learn from your mistakes.Here s the thing though; Souls games have never been about the difficulty. It was never about it being the hardest game of all time. It was never about how much you d die, how hard you throw your controller, how furious you d get. It was about the environmental storytelling, it was about the little details you d pick up from item descriptions, it was about the lore behind the characters, it was about the silent bond formed through cooperation with a summoned ally. Dark Souls isn t the hardest game of all time, and it was never meant to be. Don t get me wrong, I m not saying they re cake-walks; they ll definitely kick your ass if you don t learn, but that s just it. It was, is , and always will be a game about the reward of overcoming adversity by learning from your mistakes. Much like you would in life, you ll make mistakes. You ll stumble, you ll do the wrong thing, you ll take the wrong path, but you ll learn from those mistakes. You ll pick yourself up, dust yourself off, and chuckle as you keep on keepin on. Who s plotting against you, who s there to help, what threat s just around the corner? No one knows, life s not a fair game. At any moment, we re prepared to die, but with the knowledge of the past we can better face the trials ahead. Dark Souls is the game of life, so chin up; you learn something new every day.",1

Positive,"Amazing fast gameplay, the stronger 1v1 enemies feel amazing, with timing being very important, being punished but not instakilled. Smaller enemies can really surprise you in groups too.Areas feel much more alive. No square rooms dressed up with debris like in DS2, you can really feel this is a built world.This could be the best Souls game.However, there is a crashing bug tied to bonfires. This can be fixed by setting ""Lighting quality"" to low in advanced graphic settings. This change is not saved upon turning off your game, so it must be redone every time you restart the game.",1
Positive,"Dark Souls III holds a special place for me. This was my first souls game so it will always be my personal favorite. Yet it is truly something that anyone who is a fan of souls or a fan of RPGs should play.The game is beautiful. The combat is incredibly smooth and satisfying and is, in my opinion, the best in series. The levels are drop dead gorgeous with some beautiful set pieces and great enemy designs. The music is incredible and there's this sense of scale that is hard to describe. The bosses are absolutely amazing. The draw to the souls series always seems to be the bosses. Well there are some bosses in here that are a very difficult challenge and will surely make for memorable fights that will stand out as some of the best boss fights you might've ever played in a video game. This is definitely one of my favorite games of all time and I would love to forget everything and go back and experience it all again for the first time. I cannot recommend this game enough, I think everyone should play at least one of the dark souls games.",1
Positive,"(I have only played 70hrs so dont be too hard on me)How may I sum up a review for Dark Souls III In MY opinion is one of the best games I have played so far. FromSoftware managed to put in a game empathy, which I think is remarkable, not just the lore, but every NPs background is breathtaking. indeed there are issues with the game and sometimes, because we are on PC, the encounter with a cheater or modder online is to be expected.(SPOILER BELOW)Still the game is sooo immersive is amazing, I cannot explain the emotions I felt during the battle with Gael, the moment he stod up I had goosebumps all over. (By the way I did it 1st try). There I felt all the love from the game developers. So in the end, I think this is a very very very well made game, the price is a little high and if you buy it with all the DLCs is even higher, but if you manage to buy it when it is on sale, like myself (NOOOOOB), it is worth it!",1
Positive,"Dark Souls 3, Get Gud Edition.",1
Positive,"Dark souls 3 is a action JRPG made by FromSoftware just for you to play, have fun, suffer, and cry.The ""have fun"" part is not guaranteed to be present for everybody.Anyway, the game's great. A solid 8/10 honestly, very good closing game for the souls series. Is it the end of souls? I dunno, companies these days would beat any dead horsejust to keep their capita's heart pumping.STORY?:So, the story, first thing I want to address, I have no idea what the hell is going on.You have to kill some Abyss Watchers, a giant called Yhorm, Aldrich the snail guy and two cripples so you can start a new age of fire or bring upon the age of dark, as per usual, nothing much has changed with the story as in the previous games. For anybody that really gives a heck about lore I'd suggest you go watch VaatiVidya or whoever the heck is hogging the youtube views from making up theories that Miyazaki later just <can't show this word on a christian gameing site!> on.COMBAT:So combat, pretty fun, pretty challenging, don't get hit, but hit back. Two attack buttons, this time dual wielding is available, no power stance, boohoo what can you do.Two attack buttons, a block, parry button, backstep and dodge. I know it sounds like ""oh wow that's not that complex"" yeah, it's not that complex until you get into PvP Isuppose, then you really need to think what to do. From charged R2's, regular attack into a special with a finishing charged R2, you got plenty of ways to kill your enemies, just make sure you don't get killed of course.The game is this time around way faster than DS1 and DS2, feels like Miyazaki liked Bloodborne so much he wanted to make another one but then remembered he was making a soulsgame halfway through the development.Shoutout to the parry kings out there though, you guys are killing it.BOSSES IN THE BASE GAME:Bosses are all cool and dandy, none of them do really feel unfair, at least in the base game. I got one complaint on the difficulty curve with Pontif of Sulyvahn, because he is probably one of the hardest bosses in the game, and throwing him out there like that felt like a ""casual filter"" as some would say. Like I imagine that's a point where a bunch of people just rage quitted, or is it just me? Might be me, I am still a casual.THE DLC'S:Anyway as I said, none of them feel unfair in the base game, but in the Ringed City DLC a lot of players have been complaining about Midir's massive health pool, so I guess you could write that one down as an ""unfair"" boss, even though he's just more tedious than anything.The two DLC's though? Ashes of Ariandel was a dang letdown and don't let anybody tell you otherwise. Two bosses? Yeah I regret getting a season pass just because of that DLC. And no the arena was not worth it, the usual invasions are much more fun than that. But it's too late to cry about that now I suppose.Ringed City though, boy oh boy, that one surprised me. Don't get me wrong I expected From to make a DLC to make up for their mistake with Ashes of Ariandel but the sheer sizeand content of this DLC was amazing, it might even be better than the DLC from Dark Souls 1, simply glorious, honestly get Ringed City you will not be disappointed. Amazing 4 boss fights and a lot of cool weapons and spells are just waiting for you to pick them up.THE WEAPON AND ARMOR:Armor in this game has no upgrades and poise is useless outside of hyper armor. If you're not using a slow weapon that hits hard, wearing havels really won't matter. But if you're using a havels while you're wielding the Fume UGS then you can bet that you will out-trade anybody in PvP no matter who it is. Well unless you get outsmarted. In which case if you're wearing Havels and are using the Fume and do get outsmarted I suggest you delete the game and never come back on steam you filthy casual.Weapons are amazing as far as I'm concerned, sure From doesn't know how to balance them, but a lot of weapons are just amazing and I love the different weapon arts that each of them have. Just today I found out the Man Serpent Hatchet had charge with the charged R2 after you use the warcry, 10/10 surprised me really.The weapon upgrades might be some of the most detailed in the game, you have heavy, sharp, raw, chaos, fire, simple, refined, hollow, dark, deep, I'm sure I missed some,but yeah a lot of upgrades to choose, so that was a very nice thing.THE PVP:Not sure what to think about it. On another hand I love killing people, but on the other hand the netcode makes it unbearable at times. Well, might have something to do with my internet.

And yet, Gameplay feels more like Dark Souls 1 with the Bloodborne built-in graphic engine with no power stance skill (DS II feature) and non-upgradable Armor set in-game, require Skill over stats, leveling on this game it's only 1/3 way to Git Gud, the rest are majorly depending on your Skills and weapon usage.it's true gameplay last around 30 Hours, i had completed the game around 28 Hours, and i had feeling this is shortest Dark Souls game in DS Franchise. Class: DeprivedWeapon: Broadsword+10 (Except Yhorm)Level: 161 (I used level cheater due to busy work day and increased VIT for avoiding Phat ROLL)Magic: Homeward Cast only (No Other Sorcery/Miracles Used)Style: Solo Mode (No Co-op)Game features really beautiful Orchestra Music Soundtrack, especially on Bossfights and Main Menu Theme.Game also required beefy rig in order to run it, let say GTX 960 with 4GB graphic memory is at least for 1080p constant, i'm encountering stuttering issues especially when entering Road of Sacrifices and Slow loading textures when passing through area/door, but it seems recent patches has fixed this issues [1.05].+ Epic Bossfight in-game (Epic way to die in-game too!)+ creatively well designed enemies AI (Movement and Attack)+ returning elements from DS PTDE+ Atmospheric and Beautiful world of Lothric+ Beautiful Soundtracks in-game- Gameplay feels too short for A-RPG genre (30 Hours long) for first run- Plenty of Shortcuts, world seems smaller.- ""Does not open from this side"" door bruh.Despite in short of lengthiness, still this is really the best Dark Souls yet. and it's final one according to Miyazaki (The Director), reported on working new title IP recently.""PRAISE THE SOUP""PRAISE THE LADDER""SPOUSE AHEAD""",1

Positive,"Dark Souls 3 is an action game with some RPG stats and leveling. You can play in many different ways, blocking with a shield, using magic, dodging attacks with perfect timing. Dodging for me is the most enjoyable, that thrill when you dodge a series of attacks perfectly. There's many different weapons, I can't tell you anything about them as I'm the kind of person to pick one weapon and just roll with it for the entire game. I do like that this is possible, especially when you upgrade your weapons.Let's discuss what Dark Souls actually is. Dark Souls is difficult, Dark Souls is learning enemy patterns. Some of the difficulty very rarely might be unfair, this is sadly inevitable. Most of the game however will not screw you over with fake difficulty as long as you pay attention. Exceptions to this: several bosses that keep breaking your lock on due to poor design.Once you've managed to traverse one of the diverse areas you will face a boss, the bosses too have some great variety and will keep you on your toes. Though Dark Souls 3 Does tend to use a certain boss gimmick a bit too often. Knowing each boss will have a second phase where they'll get more powerful can be annoying.While exploring areas you will not have music, allowing you to soak in the atmosphere. During boss battles however there will be music and most of it is great.Dark Souls 3 requires you to go through multiple loading screens to level up as you'll have to teleport back to home base, level and and teleport back to where you were. This, as you might imagine can get quite annoying.Should you play Dark Souls 3? Yes, but only if you like being challenged; if you don't this is not a game you will enjoy in any way. Though I would like to mention I enjoy the Souls series more for the exploration and level design than the combat. This made the Ringed City DLC slightly disappointing as the level design was terrible. Ringed City was only saved by having some of the best bosses in the entire game.",1

Positive,"I was a hater back then, but now I'm a big fan of Souls games. Patience is one thing you must have during the game, because there are a couple of hard points, which you can pass by learning the tactics and movesets. the story is so vast to the point that I might take class sessions to learn the lore of Dark Souls.Boss Fights are the times when you shout and scream as if you're fighting them yourself lol. although, I had a hard time killing some of them, like The Brothers and Nameless King. I also played both DLCs and boy it was exciting. Slave Knight Gael truly is one hell of a boss fight.The graphics are greats, plus the designs of characters and locations is gorgeous. The Music. OMG the music is so damn good, My favourite is the one called ""Epilouge"" which plays during the credits. With all that said, I still agree that Souls games are hard, but like I mentioned, It requires skill and patience. you have plenty of options like NPCs and online players in order pass the game, though the latter isn't functioning as of now, but It'll hopefully be fixed soon.I might play Dark Souls Remastered someday, but my main goal is playing Elden Ring next. I have some unfinished tasks in the game, so for now, I'll enjoy the time playing Dark Souls III.",1

Positive,"This was my first FromSoft game and although I didn't enjoy it at first, it really grew on me as I continued to play it. I 100% recommend it if you're looking for something that challenges you or if you're just a bit of a masochist :) . However, I was expecting things like hitboxes and various other mechanics to feel more polished than they were at times. I understand the game is meant to be difficult, but the difficulty shouldn't come from basic things like hitboxes not being consistent.With that being said, I still found the game very enjoyable in many of it's other aspects. I found it's environments and enemies really fresh and unique and although I wasn't 100% sure I knew what was going on most of the time, there is a ton of lore you can go and look into for further context if you want that. For me personally I would have liked to have seen more of that in the game other than just in item descriptions, but I feel like the gameplay 100% needs to come first so I understand why they've done it like that.Overall I liked DS3 and I suggest that if you're just starting out with FromSoft games like I was it's a good place to start!Rating: 7/10 (Good)",1

Positive,"In short, this game is a work of art, and it's essentially Dungeons and Dragons in videogame form and it's hard as hell, but you knew that already, it's a dark souls game for god's sake. There's nothing about this game that isn't beautiful, from the swamps of Farron keep to the Boreal valley. Each area has evidence that it was once thriving, but it's all faded now, and all we have left are nightmarish hollows that patrol the area. Seeing how dilapidated the world is creates this atmosphere of bleakness that few other works of art can match in quality and depth. The game play forces you to respect your enemy, or die an embarrassing death. You can't just spam left click and win (except if you pick easy mode, aka the knight), you have to always be patient and take your time with each encounter, which can be hard considering how aggressive some of the enemies can be. It doesn't matter what your level is, it just matters how calm and skillful you are, and I think it's amazing the game is so well balanced to allow that to happen. This game treats you with respect, and expects you to be able to keep up with it's lore and combat, and in this era of constant hand holding and linearity that caters to everyone, its refreshing to be thrown into a game with nothing but your wits and intuition. One final thing I would like to say is that if you're gonna play this game, don't look up anything about the lore, and just stick to looking up tips for bosses that you're struggling with, or some collectibles you missed, it'll make the game much more enjoyable to piece everything together through reading loading screens and from other clues.",1

Positive,"Dark Souls 3 is a game that compels players to persevere on the path to victory, constantly testing their endurance and decision-making skills. It is a game that presents a unique world, saturated with a dark atmosphere, terrifying monsters, and captivating bosses.One of the main advantages of Dark Souls 3 is its difficulty. The game doesn't offer players easy victories, and each obstacle presents a new challenge. This forces players to continuously improve their skills and make decisions that can impact the outcome of the game.The visual design in Dark Souls 3 is stunning. The game boasts detailed graphics that create a dark, ominous world filled with horrifying monsters and animated undead. Every element of the game is crafted with great attention to detail, creating a breathtaking atmosphere.The sound design in the game is also remarkably well-executed. The sounds recreate the atmosphere of the dark world and contribute to a sense of realism during gameplay. This adds even more immersion to the unique world.One of the drawbacks of Dark Souls 3 is that the game can be quite challenging for new players. It takes time and patience to learn how to play, and even experienced players may face difficulties in completing the game.In summary, Dark Souls 3 is a game that demands a lot of effort and patience from the player, but it also offers a unique and captivating world that compels players to persevere on the path to victory. If you're looking for a new challenge in the gaming industry, Dark Souls 3 is a game worth trying.",1
Positive,"EDIT: After 90 hours, beating the game twice including all DLC and optional bosses, this is by far the greatest solo player game I've ever played - no contest. Everything is a masterpiece, with a standing ovation for all the boss music. It's unlike anything I've ever played in my life.Original post: One of the best games I've ever played. The story is so rich and full of mysterious things that keep you wondering, ""wtf is this weird item for?"" And come to find out, it's a vital piece to a much bigger puzzle all along. I'm just now scratching the surface with only 35 hours put in the game so far, but good grief. If you thought this game was all about finding the big badass bosses, there's so much more than that.Quick background: I played through Dark Souls 2, but I will admit that I half-assed it. I got lazy at the end and bum-rushed through the bosses to get over with it. It's been hard to not do that with this game because there's so many things I know I'm missing. That's what makes this game so repeatable, and allows you to explore so many different builds.",1
Positive,"I played this game for a long time, this game is not game which you will do speed run for a couple tries.Bought this about 8/9 months ago and i played it every day litle bit. Last few days i played it alot.My opinon: This game is not for everyone, you need to be rly focused good on fights and you shouldnt be greedy to go for couple more hits.So lets talk now bout stuff in game. Story mode (Exclude DLCs) is awesome rly well done and game is allowing you to play which every boss you want mid game, thats really cool for me.DLCs: Not so good optimized when we talking about enemy attacks, it acts really weird. First Boss in Ashes of Ariandel at Cathredal is so buggy, you dodge attack but it still hits you or you attack and see that she/he got attack, but game doesnt register it and it dont lose health. The Ringed City is so hard dlc but worth to buy it, Boss fights and places are rly cool madeBuy Deluxe Edition only if you are really good focused in game and you rly want to finish every singe thing in game.MY Ratings:Graphics: 10/10 (Really well made and game is rly good optimized in that way)Story Lines: 10/10Characters Actings: 10/10Boss Fights: 9/10 (Cuz Bosses in the end are really easy to get)Soundtrack: 10/10Overral Rating: 9.8/10",1

Positive,this game very relaxing,1
Positive,"This game. man, this game. There's so many different reason why I find this game to be incredible. I'll try to list them below, but forgive me if I miss anything obvious""- Immersive world. From the characters you meet to the lore of the game and even the multiple endings and their meanings, the story just sucks you in. What you think may be the best choices for your character end up bringing the Age of Darkness to the world. Each character is unique, every area beautifully detailed, and every single death as spectacularly frustrating as the last one. - Combat and customization. Where to even begin here? There are over 180 different weapons. While there are some weapons that share a similar moveset, it still leads to a game where each playthrough feel completely different. At this point, each of my playthroughs are usually just me randomly rolling ""What will I use this time? Will I play a pure pyromancer who forgoes all melee weapons? Will I use dark pyromancy only? Will I use Demon Scar and adopt a hybrid playstyle?"" There are so many different ways to play the game that it's hard to get bored of it all. And for me, the combat feels fast paced, which I love. Going from Demon Souls and Dark Souls 1, where combat felt stiff, this game just brings so much to the table. Each weapon has unique weapon arts, true combos, etc. I could go on and on about the diversity of the combat. - Music. My god, the music in this game. There are days where I will just open the game and let it sit on the title screen so I can listen to it over and over. I cannot stress enough how incredible the music is for this game. When you're in the middle of a boss fight and the choir breaks out, you really start to feel that ""Okay, this is a REAL boss fight"". I don't know how they do it, but my God, they nail the music every single time. - Graphics. The first time I beat High Lord Wolnir and stepped into Irithyll Valley, I was BLOW AWAY. And it's not just this area. the whole game is beautifully dark. You can tell someone poured their heart into the design and it shows. My favorite bits are as I'm progressing and reach an area and notice ""Wow. that's where I was the other day. It looks so small from here"". Even the enemy design is beautiful, although a bit creepy at times haha. I just can't say enough about how much love was put into their art style. I honestly cannot recommend this game enough. Even for folks who die to the first boss over and over again. keep going. I stopped playing for a while when I got stuck on a boss and came back later only to destroy them. And it made me feel on top of the world. Everyone should give this game a chance and really experience it",1
Positive,"Where do i start, hearing about Dark Souls before I can remember, its incredible, I did not play the first 2 games either but learned the roped in this game, first time playing is challenging, fun, amazing. Learning abut the New Games afterwards and how it get HARDER, just keeps you playing, after a while you can play this game for chilling time.Playing with friends is a great bonding time and always nice to talk about lore (yes there is some amazing lore).I really suggest this game to anyone, with controller support, a huge community, and years of time passed for any questions you need can be answered online from older discussions, don't be scared about starting it without playing older ones. Get used to dying and learn. Link the fire!",1

Positive,yes its game,1
Positive,"I never imagined myself playing any of the Dark Souls games. I first delved into the series back when I bought a PS3 and played Demon Souls. I immediately returned it and chopped it up to ""I am just not into these types of games.""Recently I played The Surge and Jedi: Fallen Order, and to my surprise, really enjoyed them. So, I finally decided to install it (its been in my library forever) and give it a try. I immediately fell in love with it.The world is absolutely beautiful. In some areas you can look into the distance and see castles and keeps in the distance that you will eventually travel to. The areas themselves, except for a few choice areas (Farron Keep), are well built and really fun to explore and discover new enemy types. The bosses are fun and challenging, and will keep you on your feet. Every day I could not wait to get home and continue the story. The combat in this game is fluid and fun. I really feel like I am hitting the enemy and it makes tearing down that next tough enemy all the more rewarding. I love RPGs, and this game really scratches that itch. The level up system is cool and rewarding. I believe that it does take time to really feel the effects of leveling up, but after a while you can really see your character developing into what you want them to be. The amount of weapons is staggering. From what I had read when beginning the game, every weapon is viable throughout the entire game. Some will be stronger of course, but in the end, does not matter all that much. Getting to level up your weapons is an added bonus that really starts to make you feel powerful.The story is pretty confusing to be honest. I am not sure if it is due to the fact that this is the first game in the series I completed, but I did need to look up the lore to understand what was happening. You can very easily miss important story items if you do not look hard enough. This is fine, I know that this is part of the charm of the series. I still enjoyed reading about the lore online and putting the puzzle pieces together. For a game that tells almost no story, there is so much there. I don't know how, but it just works.Even though there were times in this game that were infuriating, this game is now one of my top 5 favorite games of all time. I cannot believe it took me so long to play this game. Do yourself a favor and play this. Do not let the difficulty keep you away because it really is not all that bad.Now I just want to give Demon Souls another chance. Fingers crossed that the remastered edition will release on Steam! And Bloodborne too. Let us have that too!",1

Positive,This Game Is So Cool And Challenging Its Better To Try It :D,1
Positive,"Well I started playing this with beating it as a goal. Next thing I knew i had 300+ hours spent on it and I was aiming for the Dark Soul achievement. There is no one way to beat Dark Souls, you can always create your challenges and then overcome them or you can learn the easiest way to beat an area/boss and then use that knowladge to breeze through the game. This game is as hard as you make it to be. And this game teaches you through dying so embrace it. Don't give up skeleton!",1
Positive,"Absolutely awesome game. I had heard over the years that the Dark Souls series was among the harder games on the market. For this reason, I wanted the challenge and to see what it was like for myself. From an incredibly immersive and rich atmosphere and storyline to exciting combat and gear, this game did not disappoint whatsoever. It did an excellent job living up to its challenging reputation, and left me constantly wanting to keep playing to get past that one difficult stage. It had me hooked very quickly. I found myself retrying things just for the fun of it, looking for different tactics and always looking forward to seeing that next campfire where I can take a break. The boss fights and strenuous combat always had me on the edge of my seat. The graphics always have me taking a moment to look around, and take a look at that sweet sweet armour. A variety of weapons allowed for me to fine-tune my character to a play style I enjoy, and let me savour every second I spent in combat. There is plenty to customise and experience and I always strive for a better piece of gear. There are many combat concepts that allow for your fighting style to be diverse and to be played as you wish to play it. Slow, heavy weapons to lighter quick ones, shields, and so on. Other combat mechanics, like backstab for example, allow for an even MORE diverse playstyle and combat system. (Note that there is much more than just backstab. Not to mention, magic! Always a treat). Dark Souls continuously has me hooked on the game and fully immersed, eyes on the screen and nowhere else. With such a well-built world that is so immersive in so many ways, why would I want to look away? At this time, with only 57 hours on record, I still find myself working on my character build and improving myself. I am far from completing the deep story and find myself repeatedly distracted looking for some special items. The game is NOT pay to win, which I am thankful for and value in a game. There is no pop-up every few minutes to buy some special sword for 50 bucks. You are left to the game, and that is that. Character customisation allows for you to upgrade specific stats to what you wish, which will impact your abilities. Each stat will have their own effect. For example, some weapons require more strength to wield. The game is also NOT something quickly completed. I often find myself bored when I play through a game where you beat it in an hour with max-level gear. Dark Souls 3 is not like that, and has a lot to discover with a large amount of gameplay. Things do not happen fast, you will not level your stats and get better gear from a single quest. It will take time and will keep you immersed for a long period of time, at least for me personally. A lot of the game's solemn, dark aesthetic was extremely satisfying and felt great to explore. It all has a certain tone to it that makes me want to keep playing even more. There is nothing quite like the feeling of finally beating a boss you have spent hours not just fighting, but reaching. And the relief of seeing that campfire afterwards is like none other. Dark Souls never fails to send a shiver up my spine from how good everything looks and how satisfying everything is. They do not go easy on you, and make it very challenging yet not impossible. It certainly lives up to its reputation. DS3 is regarded as one of the most challenging games of the series, being known to many people as one of the hardest games ever. Take that how you like, and form your own opinion on that one. Note my profile picture. The aesthetic of the game draws me in and I find it incredible to look at, to the point of changing my pfp to match it. Personally, the game is worthy of the hype and high ratings, and I look forward to working more at the game and getting better. I love the game and will be happily spending much more time on it in hopes of finally beating it. To this day, it does not disappoint whatsoever. After some time off my computer due to my computer sucking. I look forward to jumping back into this. I should also note, while I am at it, that the game runs surprisingly well, even on my 7 year old computer that can hardly run anything. I did not have to dull down the impressive graphics at all, and it continues to run smoothly. The money, in my opinion, is certainly worth it. You will get a lot of bang for your buck as well as hours upon hours of good times. Especially with the sale on currently, I think the game is worth picking up. 10/10. Happy soul gathering :)",1
Positive,This is quite possibly the greatest game of all time.,1
Positive,"Darksouls 3 is so far the most infuriating game that I have ever had the pleasure of playing. I play a lot of games on hard difficulty and yet this game was able to make me genuinely angry. There are multiple things that I am going to talk about in this review but this is again from my perspective of the game.The first thing is that I played through the game experiencing stuttering due to what I can assume is hard drive problems. The graphics weren't the problem so I had to do further investigation and found that many people were saying it was something to do with how the game played on hard drives. The community has around 3 sides which are those that cause utter chaos and respond to anyone asking for help with git gud , those that try their best to help and guide you through the game, and those that strictly play offline to avoid people. The graphics for the game are nice and its design is interesting. The weapon upgrade system is nice and decently balanced. One of the main issues I had with the game was that your first run of the game would be absolutely brutal. Someone who hasn't played a previous Darksouls game and isn't used to hard difficulty will get very frustrated and give up. However this is only for the first run of the game, my 2nd and 3rd runs of the game were easy and I was able to complete many of the bosses in one go. Most of the bosses you will either beat first try or end up dying a lot until you figure out the move sets they use. My favorite bosses were champion gundyr and darkeater midir. Covenants are somewhat grindy but add some motivation in the game to either invade people or help them. Playing with friends is fun but is a little tricky sometimes to get to work. I found getting to the boss was much more difficult than the boss itself which at times was very infuriating, I would die 8 times to mobs only to kill the boss on the first go. The biggest thing that I can say that was more annoying than the invaders, lag, and bosses was that when you play with a mouse and keyboard, certain keys have multiple functions. So when I would swing my sword it had a 25% chance to kick the enemy. The amount of times I died to such a thing is utter bull, the fact that you couldn't change it in the settings was even bigger. The community response was a shrug or git gud . The walls do not function as walls a lot of the time as well, you can hit enemies right through them. Another thing that can happen is if you are falling the edges of whatever you land on become a slip and slide, usually ending in your demise. A lot of the people I talked to said that you were supposed to get satisfaction from killing the bosses that you died so much at, it didn't feel like that to me. It felt like I was dragging my fat f***ing nuts through the farron swamp water. I actually went throughout the game saying it was sh*t for about the entire first playthrough. In the end this game was an experience and I GREATLY RECOMMEND THE GAME to any who want to contemplate their life choices and possibly break something you own. It's just something you have to try for yourself to see. The ending scenes were some of the most beautiful that I have seen in games and its lore is decent as well.

Positive,"Dark Souls III has been one of the most unforgettable gaming experiences I have had. It is truly a modern gaming classic and would recommend it to anyone (who doesn't lose their patience easily). There are almost too many different things to look into and collect and that can be daunting. There's also a huge learning curve for learning the combat mechanics. I can safely say, this is a fantastic game though. It has a very grim and lovecraftian-esque theme with larger than life ambiance which is integrated into characters and environment. As far as replayability, I can't say I would play this game over and over. Maybe 4 playthroughs. It is super challenging and fun overall though and I highly recommend it.",1
Positive,100% worth it,1
Positive,best game of all time .,1

Positive,"This is such a great masterpiece.Even u are a new to pc or a veteran u will feel the pressure throughout your progression in this game.Each boss is a challage which mean u need to surpass it.But to surpass them won't be so easy.I recommend this game for you if you love fantasy (little bit dark in here :V) and 1 player game.If u played some MMORPG,u will definitely love DS3 becuz it also have pvp online.The atmosphere will make you fall over it.I love this game so much <3",1
Positive,Its a really good game but be aware if you buy a DLC and play dark souls 3 and you want to refund the DLC after you play when you refund it you can't play on the same character again unless you buy back the DLC other then that GREAT game,1
Positive,"Although I might have died a TON this game kept me trying again and again and again and again until I rather beat the part/boss I have been stuck on, or summon some random guy who usually curb stomps the boss for me. This game can take a decent amount of time to beat depending how fast you pick up the mechanics, and learn how to read your enemies. This game has given me allot of replayability through trying different weapons as there are a fair selection of weapons that work different from all the others. -many weapons(magic,swords,great swords,ultra greats words,axes,great axes, hammers, halberds, spears, shields that you can parry with, shields you can absorb tons of damage with, ect.)-sense of accomplishment when you beat a boss you have been stuck on-Can play offline, with a friend(you will be at risk of being invaded by other players if you are playing online and you are embered), you can also invade other peoples worlds for PVP In conclusion good game it is.",1
Positive,"This game is a pure masterpiece! I love every second of it. At first it seems as a very hard, nerve destroying game, but after playing it for a while, you really change your mind. Initially, I bought it as a challenge to brag to my friends, but then i fell in love with this game. It is sure holding a spot in my ALL TIME favorite games. I would really recommend it to anyone.And don't forget to.",1

But if you can't git gud, just call a friend and it gets a lot easier.(the inicial statement is just to try and make people who are too afraid of the difficulty of DS games to try DS3 out, because it's an amazing game and everyone should try it)Really, just play it. If you like RPGs, if you like character building, if you like deep, intricate lores and interesting NPCs, just play it.",1
Positive,"The definition of depressingly beautiful, the game suggests you play it as it is: defeat the bad guys and save the world.And this is how I went through my playthrough. It took me about 130 hours to beat the game, that's considering I went through the trouble of exploring every nook and cranny, defeating every unique enemy, picking up any orb I see, and admiring any view I would stumble across.From the walk out to the Last Flame and seeing all the destroyed ruins to the view of Anor Londo, this game, despite being labeled a difficult game, intrigues you enough to complete it despite your tumbling. However, once you beat the game, look into the lore, I am in no ways a lore guy, and lore bores the fuck out of me, but hearing how the world had evolved in this game had passed, makes you almost feel bad for completing the game.",1
Positive,"The third installation of the franchise whic is the Dark Souls of the Dark Souls in terms of difficulty, artwork, gameplay and longevity was in shelves almost three years ago but it is still capable to amaze in how much this game is well produced, directed and build.For the hardcore fans it would be the not ""grandiose"" ending of one of the most acclaimed RPG franchise of the last decade that maybe they waited for, but it would be a great one nonetheless, and for those that approach this type of game for the first time, probably is the best chapter to ""start"" with. As a matter of fact, you cannot actually start a story in any Dark Soul ,because the narration always sets you in a moment of time where the great events that shook that cycle (because time is cyclical in Dark Souls) are long past and you are the last, dying breath of that world whic is ready to lay down and die (and in many,many,many occasions, bring you down with him) and let you explore an almost barren landscape wich in reality is brimming with life. And death. Mostly with death.As always, the narration is not built around long and meaningful dialogues by the characters we meet ( even if that dialogues often are short but always meaningful, in their way) but mainly by the items we collect through our journey, and that is one of the greatness of this game, the capacity of make you wonder what is happened way before you where there, and to connect the dots in your own unique way, to have the story leading according to your likings.And as the story unravels in front of you, discretely the world with his now various ambients wich merges almost perfectly with one another makes you cherish every single ""level"" thanks to their variety of ambients, enemies and bosses wich are uniques in their own way, with very little exceptions that are, with a great trick of the plot, greatly justified.The gameplay, with the adding of the ""Weapons Art"" is more fluid than ever and where the past combat animation where either hand-mande but beautiful, or with the mo-cap but stiffy and repeated, all now feels unique in their way, with the animations, special attacks and skills well crafted with both a good mo-cap and computer elaboration. As always every boss fight have its own unique musical theme, whic are majestic and greatly composed, and resonate with the silence whic is omnipresent in the world, where we can only hear our steps and the cry of agony of our foes. Same as for the past installations, the DLC's are a gorgeous addiction and the story do not feels complete without them, so it's greatly recommended to purchase all of them.In conclusion, Dark Souls III is a masterpiece whic every single RPGs fan, and none, should hold in his hands and play it, because not only is one of the cornerstones of the genre, but also a very engaging and challenging game that will make you feel like every single victory in the game, is a victory in real life.",1

The graphics are stunning, combat is fluid and the music and voice acting is just phenomenal.Don't buy this game if you have no patience to learn. Because it will only punish you by bringing tears and anger upon you.10/10 Git Gud or Die Tryin'",1
Positive,"I cannot recommend this game enough. I love it , my favourite of the soul series. Visuals are stunning , bosses are interesting , gameplay is fun and dynamic. Difficulty curve is real. Game is great fun , and the PvP scene - which is the true end game - is very much alive and well , beware of trolls and grievers though. But that is just a feature which makes the game more HARDCORE ! Minor bugs - also called features that make the game more HARDCORE !Sometimes you due to the camera controls.a feature which just makes the game more HARDCORE !Praise the sun , git gud , and die !",1
Positive,"Yes this game has been out for some time now, but still i wanted to give an opinion. This game made me fall in love with RPG games, especially Dark Souls. The atmosphere is just right. Its great that there's this mixed feeling of an open world and linear gameplay, it makes it worth exploring but not too difficult to find your way. The PvP is a bit less great, its been improved over the time but still backstabs dont work great. sometimes you hit somebody but it doesnt damage. This is no problem for people playing offline. I also really enjoy the adding of weapon arts, it gives combat a way different style and makes incredible combo's possible. For me, this is an amazing game.",1
Positive,"its beautiful game, the music ,gameplay, weapons, mechanics, boss, traps, every dam thing is good in this game. i dont say its hard game, its just u have to be careful at every time in game, assume you are level 400 and if u careless, any enemy can kill you in 2-3 hits, and all npc including friendly and non friendly can killable. the key part of game is ""what you have done is done its cannot be undone"" , wethere u do it in purpose or by mistake, game doesnt care about that.This game also tells you that you should never give up, i really learned from this game, i have spend about a whole day for killing 1 boss, and the satisfaction u get from killing or achiving is amazing, u dont get it anywhere.one advice if you are not played and want to buy thisjust blindly go for it. and never watch any guide, walkthorugh or any kind of video, because it will be more fun in that way, i still wish i forget about this game everything and start as a new, its amazing feelingPraise the sun",1
Positive,"about 300 hours of playtime hereFor begginners this game is indeed difficult especially if your new to the souls series like i was this game will train your reaction timing and your usual play style with other rpg type gamesalthough it is difficult there is no better feeling than finally defeating a boss that was giving you trouble for hours straight dont give up keep trying you get better every time, the gameplay of this game is amazing and the designs theyve put into the different areas such as irithyll and the castle , for those who are not sure if they should buy the game or not i can say it is deffiniently worth it",1

YesWill this game confuse you time and time again with its cryptic storytelling? YesWill you get stuck in an area and ultimatley rage quit after attempting to speedrun the area? YesWill you kill the Nameless King first try? NoWill you upgrade luck? Maybe on accident",1
Positive,"I bought this game on release and forgot to write a review. This is perhaps my favourite game of the last couple of years. It takes the Souls games formula to perfection. While the lore in this game seems to be tailored to old time fans, with all its references to the first game, it still stands alone as an example of exquisite craftsmanship. It's extremely rich in content, and both of the DLC's are awesome.Overall for me an absolute 10/10. I love it <3",1

I could talk about for like ages and ages how incredible the atmosphere is, or the visual- and world design, original soundtrack and the implementation of the lore into the gameplay and the world itself, but all of that has been written before, all across the web. And no, Dark Souls is not only about how hard is it, this trilogy offers something which you just can not find in any other title (besides Demon's Souls and Bloodborne). Since I played FROMSOFTWARE's masterpieces, I can't truly enjoy and sink hours and hours into other games anymore.Why would I? I have Dark Souls.",1

It rewards the grinders or the hardcore badasses who enjoy the game and you can joing random people at anytime which you can help or hunt. I would HIGHLY recommend this game to anyone looking for a fun challenge",1
Positive,Overall brilliant game! The easiest Souls game to date and worth every cent. Dark Souls III offers a more polished (noob Friendly) set of mechanics and the enemies are more forgiving. Great game to sink plenty of hours into. It's a game that new players to the Souls series can get into and have a blast.,1

Positive,"Para mi el mejor de los 3 sin dudarlo. Las cosas que tiene este juego superaron ampliamente sus 2 entregas anteriores.

Positive,"Tip from someone who recently beat the game.You can use the cord for your controller to hang yourself.Due to many responses as to having wireless controllers bash your head with it until you forget about the game or you die doing it.I've completed the game and yet, I'm not satisfied.",1
Positive,darksoul's is like anal hurt's like a bitch for the first little while then you start to really enjoy it,1
Positive,"Before I say anything else, this was my first Souls experience, including Bloodborne.People have said you need a controller, and that's absolutely not true - I started the game with M/KB thinking I'd get as far as I could at least, and wound up beating the whole thing without being annoyed about controls, including the endgame optional boss with keyboard and mouse. For those who like controllers, go for it obviously, but for those of us who strongly prefer M/KB, it's a perfectly servicable option. That said, control labels will be off, so you'll need to remember that X and Y correspond to E and F, respectively, and a few other oddities. Oh, and you have to exit to main menu and press a button to exit the game. Or Alt+F4, which it complains about, but I did it anyway.In every other regard, it's a great PC port, and I had no performance issues, etc, and the mouse movement felt great to me. Mouse support in menus was a welcome surprise.The game itself is a masterpiece. I can't remember the last time I played a game that was able to make me this frustrated but keep me playing. The difficulty curve is a little all over the place - I found the last few bosses much easier than some of the midgame bosses - but the whole ""Dark Souls is hard"" narrative is pretty correct. There's very little room for error in most fights, and it gets harder as you go on, for the most part. What's interesting is that they managed to make the progression of your character feel meaningful while increasing that difficulty, which is a place many games screw up, either by making the player overpowered or by having to pull a macguffin and remove abilities to make boss fights hard or something. This game does none of that, but you do feel like you're getting somewhere as you level up.The enemy design is pretty spectacular, although there's some ""oh, Japan."" moments. It's fun to see a Japanese game set in Western fantasy, though. It's an interesting cultural perspective.In terms of the game design, there's some obtuse stuff; unhelpfully named items, a number of poorly-explained mechanics (parrying, damage scaling, weapon upgrades), arcane NPC plots, and quest-crucial stuff being hidden will all have you looking things up online. Let's just say this is a good game to have a second monitor for. I can't imagine what people playing this on their living room TV would have done. I guess iPads are a thing now.Speaking of which, while I can see this being the kind of game that would appeal to people who want to find out everything on their own no matter how long it takes, for the rest of us there are some really excellent walkthroughs and guides out there. Without that kind of assistance, I would never have gotten through the game; I would have missed something important, gotten frustrated, and done something else.I feel like a lot of diehard fans are going to look at me like a casual tourist scrub, and you know, they're not wrong. I don't really play games to prove something, but for entertainment, and while this game did force me to step up my game, and did make me really frustrated in parts (Dancer of the Boreal Valley was a personal low point) being able to finally get past something that's been stumping you for an hour or two is really satisfying. Despite all the flaws - and I DO view the obtuse stuff as flaws - I enjoyed the heck out of this game. I would recommend this game to anyone who thinks they're up for a challenge.Also, for what is technically a JRPG, this game is amazingly light on cutscenes, even by Western standards. Like damn. Still had a full-DBZ-mode moment or two in it, though. And no shortage of helmets worn so far forward they're actually blindfolds.Final opinion:8/10 Gud Sh!t Here",1

It can can be very challenging at times but equally rewarding with a great sense of achievement. The lore in the Souls games is some of the best I ever come across in any game. Great RPG mechanics with optional PVP if your into it. By no means am I a good player but the game still managed to keep me invested in advanceing the story, all in all a great game well worth a playthrough you won't be disapointed.",1

Positive,"This epic game ruined all other action RPGs for me through and through. The community aspect of the game is one of the best parts of the game for me personally. Truly you see all sorts of people in the game, from the nice ones to the a-holes but people are generally awesome for the most part. I've had many positive experiences with players from all over the world and made a couple of really good friends from it too.The game is also versatile enough for you to be able customise your gaming experience and how you choose to enjoy the game. For example, I enjoy mainly PvE and jolly co-op but I know of others who love duelling PvP or solely invading. You can level up as high as you want or finish the game in as low level as possible for a sadistic challenge. The possibilities are endless! And I don't need to go on about how absolutely GORGEOUS the game is because the other reviewers here have already said it for me. I love this game so much and it is truly a masterpiece and in a league of its own. I see myself sinking another 100 hours into it easily.

Positive,"This game is beautiful not just graphically, but emotionally. I was invading as a mad spirit in farron's woods. I find the host and their summon. ""Oh boy, I'm going to get ganked,"" I think to myself, ""maybe I can fool them into trusting me. "" I put my weapons up, wave at them, ""HELLO"" the carving drops. They seem less tense, so I drop a seed of a giant tree. I point down at it and back away, sitting down to wait for then to take the bait. They do it, use it. It's time to jump for joy and they do so back. We fight through countless enemies in a poison swamp, make our way up a tall tower, and there's the mini-boss. Time for the fight.Minding my spacing to not hit my allies, we take the fiend down. Their healths' low, I could finish them in one hit. ""No, not yet"" I think aloud. I'll let them get to a bonfire. We progress, jump down a cliff. I lost my control, I go for the plunging attack but in midair I realize I'd hesitated too long. I turn around so it seems like it was an accident. They both lock onto me. ""Oh no, this is it."" I walk past as if nothing happened. . and it worked!We continue through deadly swamp and basilisk, large demons tromp through but we persist. We reach a new bonfire, the poison has eaten the host to the last of their health. ""I could hit them now and it would all be over."" No, I can't it would be wrong. We've fought together for 30+ minutes, and I've done it all for no souls since I was an invader. The host lights the bonfire. . and sits there. They waited to for the poison to finish them off, I get my vertebra shackle, and bow. HOST OF EMBERS DEFEATEDThis game has made me feel things.",1
Positive,"The words ""You Died"" have been plastered into the back of my skull. Thank you Dark Souls.",1
Positive,"This is one of the greatest games of all time. Its probably the best game I've ever played. You get used to dying and the best tip is when you die it's either part of the game, i.e you're not a high enough level yet, or it was your fault. Its hard but so worth every controller that gets broken in the progress, worth every curse at loved ones and once you've completed it you get to go through all of it all over again!Get souls Praise the sun",1
Positive,"Dark Souls 3 is like a easier version of Dark Souls 1 with the only real issues being 3 puzzle bosses and so much fan service that you can't tell if the game has anything new to add to the series character wise.This being my first real Dark Souls game as I didn't really get into Dark Souls 2 as the P.V.E was totally crazy with horrible hitboxes and insane amounts of enemies being placed in single locations while lacking else where.I have already pumped about 30 hours into the game as I am writing this review and I am yet to try out the P.V.P as I am slightly intimidated by how bad the netcode is and how good people are.Edit: Alright I have put about a solid 20 hours into P.V.P and invasions and I can safely say that it isn't as good as Dark Souls 2 but better than Dark Souls 1. Invasions are annyoing because of multiple opponents going up against you most of the time and it's likely that you die quickly upon entering the world. P.V.P is very basic with many weapons performing better than others and magic and that meaning that those weapons are very common to find. But diversity is possible and you can get away with doing pretty much anything as long as you just make sure that you know how to use your weapon.I have heard that this game is the easiest out of all of the games in the Souls series and it shows for the first couple of bosses but other than this slight difficulty issue that games is great.On to the issues with the first bosses is how easy they are with all of them having small health bars and the only difficult you might have is with trying to use magic on them. They also hit weakly meaning that if you don't just stand there and tank and just get hit once or twice then you will be fine for the most part.Currently this review is still in development but as I experience more and more of the game I will keep on updating this review.SUMMARY:Dark Souls 3 is a great game I recommend for new players of the series with the only faults being easy early game bosses and pretty much all bosses in general having a low health bar with all this being topped of with a pretty linear P.V.P. system.Apart from that I have to say that Dark Souls 3 is a great game with plenty of challenge for newer players but not as much for veterans of the series.Overall this game is very solid and is deserving of 8/10.EDIT: The game is great and that's what I already have said. But this game suffers from some very big and quite glaring issues.The start of this game from the 3rd Area (2nd non-tutorial area) to the 6th area (5th non-tutorial area) are just annoying and slow. The enemies are slow and annoying and are full of horrible concepts that weren't executed right. The places themselves are plain and just ugly. The bosses (not including the 6/5th area boss) are easy. That entire part of the game is just. Not very fun on consecutive runs.After that the game is just infinitely better. Apart from the Dungeon.I hate that place.I wish they could have just done something exciting and fun for those 3 areas and not just some bland and not fun areas.Otherwise this game is great and feels a lot less clunky then Dark Souls 1 and a lot less annoying than Dark Souls 2.The bonfire placement in this game is needless to say kind of silly. Some bonfires being only 10 metres away.Apart from these issues and bosses having really small health pools in the start of the game this game is great.The DLC has come out quite recently and after playing it I can confim that PVP has been fixed to a certain extent. The DLC has added a whole new area and an arena, as well as two bosses, pne being average and the other being amazing. Once again I cannot recommend this game enough as it is an amazing game to enter the souls series with if you haven't already.",1
Positive,"Thank you FromSoftware; as a bored adult gamer, you ve brought the real joys of gaming to me once again.TL;DR: Been getting bored of games fairly quickly in the last few years and didn t seem to have much attention span for most. Then bought Dark Souls 3 when it came out as my first ever Souls game in the series, got massively hooked and felt the real joys of gaming again. Bought the other 2 as well as a PS4 so I could play Bloodborne and now I m a complete addict!I have been a gamer since I remember, and now in my early 30 s, for the past few years, I found myself getting bored of games very quickly. From AAA s to indie games I d mostly end up playing them just so I can beat them and be done with them so I could move on to the next title, like ticking chores off a list, and quite often not even bother finishing the game at all (I m sorry The Divinity, you were one of the better games I played recently!)I d known about the Soul games for years, but had been hesitant to even try them for fear of frustration and boredom from their infamous difficult gameplay and the countless deaths phenomena. Until a few months ago I saw an interesting video that delved deep into the Soul games sense of exploration, and the rewarding factor of the games - something I truly realised later on when I played the games - so i decided to pick up Dark Souls 3 upon its release a couple of months ago. After countless hours of frustration and deaths (as expected), I realised I must be doing something wrong; I may not be a real hardcore gamer, but surely I can t be that bad? That s when I decided to read up on the games mechanics, stats system, guides on how to play as a noob, what starter class to pick, guides on parrying and so on and on and on. So I started a new game, picked up a knight and started to play properly. Never have I ever found myself so immersed in a game in such a long long time. I invested so much time in the game, not only by playing, but also reading up about every bit of the game - something that I d barely and rarely done with any game before, unless it was a little walkthrough through some section of some game I was stuck at or some such. I studied the maps and made sure I missed not a single item. I read up on all different NPC s and quest lines to make sure I d make the most of the play-through, something I realised later wasn t possible to achieve in just one play-through. So not so shockingly, I started the NG+ once I beat the game so I can achieve 100% achievement completion: an idea that I would ve laughed off at in any previous games that I d played. Who gives a damn about achievements?""Nonetheless, I loved this game so much I bought the kickstarter board game and the other 2 Soul games in the series, which I m yet to play because I ended up buying a PS4 (that came with Uncharted4) just so I can play Bloodborne. Yes, I m really that much affected (read: obsessed) by these games. And Bloodborne: what an utterly gorgeous game. It d probably come as to no surprise at this rate to say that I even ordered the game s guidebook, to save myself from countless amounts of internet checking (which I still do anyway!). I could write a long post about how amazing this game is but I ll save that for another time!So thank you again FromSoftware for making some of the most amazing games in all my years of gaming experience, and bringing back the joys of gaming again to this bored-no-more adult gamer. My wallet may hate your guts, but I love you.",1
Positive,"To preface my thoughts on Dark Souls 3 I should provide some background information about my experiences with the Fromsoft series as a whole.I started playing the series at Dark Souls, I never got the chance to play Demon Souls and now the graphics are a bit too outdated for me to want to go back and run through it. I had about 500 hours on Dark Souls for PS3 (which is why I dont have many hours for it on Steam) it has been by far my favourite game. I also extensively played Bloodborne on PS4 and Dark Souls 2 on both PS4 and on Steam (would estimate around 300 hours for Dark Souls 2). In addition to loving the game mechanics I also actively read up and watch Youtube video's on the lore behind the series as I find the Fromsoft version of storytelling to be quite compelling if you dive deep enough.With that out of the way, as many people have said I will rehash, Dark Souls 3 is a fantastic game. It captures all of the essence of Dark Souls while adding some good things Dark Souls 2 implemented like the bonfire fast travel. With that being said it's not as good as Dark Souls in my opinion but it is a fantastic game and if that's what you're looking for then stop now and buy this game. The mechanics are much more refined and the areas are absolutely beautiful in this game. The weapon and upgrading system is as good as it's been with many options for different playstyles. There doesn't seem to be such an easy way to progress in this game as some of the other entries in the series. For example, in Dark Souls the sorcerer class was pretty good throughout the game and it was a solid path if you were just starting out so you could learn the mechanics from a distance. In Dark Souls 3 there are bosses that favour someone using a melee build and bosses that punish it, bosses that favour miracles/pyromancies/spells and bosses that punish it. The challenging gameplay has always been the staple of this series and Dark Souls 3 doesn't hold back. It's as hard as any of the other games with bosses that are just as memorable as some of the favourites (O&S). Adding in the two phase boss fights was a really perfect way to keep replayability high and making you feel on edge the first time you make it to the second phase of a fight. This game also has the hardest boss in the entire series in my opinion, one who shall not be named or spoiled. One thing that sucks is there are some gimmicy bosses but they are mainly optional. In addition to being memorable and having solid mechanics there is also a lot of lore to most of the bosses if you're into that sort of thing. Dark Souls 3 embrases the lore and progress the timeline since Dark Souls where Dark Souls 2 tried to disregard the original. If you're a fan of Dark Souls then you probably already have had this game since launch like I did but if not there is a very nice callback area to the original.My one and only complaint about this game is the enemies and their surrounding areas. Dark Souls and even Dark Souls 2 to a degree had areas where it felt rewarding and almost necessary to kill the enemies in the area you are trying to progress through. Dark Souls 3's enemies and areas feel useless and it's almost a waste of time to clear the areas. My first playthrough I cleared all enemies before progressing as normal but on my second playthrough and beyond it just became exhausting to keep killing enemies that yield little souls and only annoy me, so I end up just running from bonfire to boss, to bonfire to boss, until I've defeated the last boss.I really love this series and this game is no exception. Though I think it's a bit inferior to Dark Souls it is by far my favourite game so far in the year and one of my favourites since I last played Dark Souls. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who loves a challenge both in boss design and area design.TL;DRPros+Great boss mechanics+Great boss lore (if you're into that sort of thing)+Immediate fast travel+Tons of weapons and spells+Great upgrading and infusion system+Signature replayabilityCons-Enemies get annoying to kill so I end up running from boss to boss-Some areas are really annoying (you know which ones if you've played the game)",1
Positive,"Much like the first Dark Souls, this game is difficult and requires a lot of patience to down the epic and challenging bosses and the, sometimes, much stronger enemies.The fact that Dark Souls III returns to the roots of Dark Souls (and Demon's Souls to a lesser extent) is incredibly exciting and I had an awesome time playing this installment. As someone who struggles to stay interested in a game for longer than a couple of hours, I've got 100+ hours clocked into DS3 and I still want to play more.A lot of my opinion on the game is based on PvE and PvE Coop (both matchmaking and password, which is a godsend), as the majority of the PvP I've done is either a pretty good matchmaking experience or I've used a password to be summoned by friends for a friendly duel. I have not experienced any issues with the online thus far, apart from a few summons being timed out, however this usually only happens once.As with DS1, the hack 'n' slash action-RPG style gameplay is what entices me the most and allows plenty of replayability using different builds and equipment. The leveling system is the key to wielding higher-tier weapons and it feels so satisfying to come back to difficult enemies in the earlier areas to slaughter them in revenge.Dark Souls III is easily one of my favourite games so far of 2016 and I'm highly anticipating the upcoming DLC.In regards to my game time and saying I have ""100+ hours clocked"", I spent about 80-90 hours on a pirated copy before I was able to afford the game. I have no regrets buying the game as I believe FROM has done an outstanding job and they deserve my money as I've enjoyed this game quite a lot. I just thought I'd write this for anyone who cares.",1
Positive,The game great. Just as every souls.,1
Positive,"Blood Souls: Prepare to Sin Edition - The Best Of Collection10/10, Miyazaki.",1
Positive,"If you enjoyed the other souls games, you will probably like this game alot. This isn't necessarily a pro's and con's list, but rather important features that make up the core game.-The combat mechanics seem to be a little faster than its predecessors, more akin to Blood Borne agility based rolling to avoid damage rather than block damage.-The story was much easier to follow than the previous souls games and proved to be quite interesting.-The summoning password feature was an excellent idea, making it easy to die again and again with your best buds!-Follows similar patterns of previous games: learning enemy types, movements, attack patterns and weaknesses; with the occasional switch up to make sure things stay spicy and you keep dying!As a returning veteran with advice for new players: Don't take it personally when you get invaded! It's a cool part of the game that you should enjoy and embrace! Who wants to fight the same old AI over and over again? Not me! Having your progress temporarily stalled to have a more technical and mechanical battle should get your blood pumping and keep you on those unkindled toes! Granted you will come across an array of seemingly unfair tactics, but everything has a counter! Now get out these and kick some ash!As a returning veteran with advice for returning players: This game has quite a different feel than the other souls games that you will quickly adapt to. If you're a perfectionist and would like to collect all the items in the game, be prepared to invest some serious time into the game for covenant item collection. I'd recommend remaining at PvP meta levels to satisfy the automatic summon covenants as you will hardly ever be summoned if your Soul Level is too high.In closing, I love this game very much, and having the oppurtunity this time around to act as a guiding hand through the realm of ash for my friends was a very rewarding and enjoyable experience.Highly Recommend",1

Positive,"Okay so having played Dark Souls1, Dark Souls 2, and Bloodborne.I have to say that this is by far my favorite so far next to Dark Souls 1. The level design is very comparable to Dark Souls1 but isn't overkill like Dark Souls 2.The bosses and the enemies are more fast paced comparable to Bloodborne fighting which is great.PVP is soooo easy in this and I love it. At Pontiff there is so many people invading and hosting it is basically like a built in fight club now. No more waiting in a forest or old boring battle systems that dont work haha. Overally I have beat the game a few times now and plan to keep playing for a while. It is unfortunate that this is the last Dark Souls. RIP",1

Positive,God.i love this game. It will make you cry and maybe sometimes you just have to give up because you are playing for 15h straight and fall asleep in a pvp battle. But god damn this game is good shit. It gave me the feel i had playing Dark Souls 1 back. The atmosphere is dark but wonderful and the locations look incredible. The whole online experience is way better and it runs smooth as fuck without crashing or buggs.10/10 would fall asleep again,1
Positive,"I personally believe it is the best of the souls games yet, perfecting combat (It underwent a few changes over the series) and making a very enjoyable rpg. The characters are fun and easy to interact with and I am really enjoying it.However I understand it would be frustrating to be unable to run it the only negative people have is that their pc's are not good enough and however that sucks don't dislike the game itself for that reason.",1
Positive,hey its pretty good,1
Positive,"After the somewhat mediocre second part, DS3 seems to be back to form. The level desgin in the first sections of the game reminds one of the best parts of the series, as well as the enemy desgin. Boss fights seem to be a bit easier so far, although I have not beaten the game as of yet, but the designs are more interesting than in DS2, reminiscent of the good ol' DS1 days. Speaking of DS1, there are multiple throwbacks and cameos, maybe even a bit too much for some. Some would call it fanservice, others well deserved since it seems to be the last part of the series.Weapon variety is given pretty much from the start, nearly as fast as in Bloodborn, as well as a lot of fashion options to clothe one for the Lords of Cinder. Also, armors stats only marginally differ between sets so you can go full fashionborn.All in all the game is fun, looks good, works (mostly) fine on my rig (framedrops when picking up new items below 20 for 1 sec) and I wanted to go to sleep 4 hours ago. so yeah, exploring and getting gud while getting horrible murdered time and time again is still as addictiv as ever.EDIT: Framedrops and performance have been fixed and the game works now without any hickups or technical issues.Also, after finishing the game now twice I can say that the game is more fun than DS2 and offers greater enemy placement as well as more ""fair"" enemy mobs. No more big mobs that crush you from the get go. The mobs you will encounter remind more of the DS1 mobs in Undead burg, which could kill you but were easy to kill. Also enemy groups can be singled out to instead of group aggroing like in DS2 (Bell Knight boss run f.e.).All in all I would recommend this game fully to any fan of the series as well as people who like some challenge and exploration in their game. Multiple replays still entertain as I am now on my third character, ready to discover the secrets of Ariandel.",1

Positive,"Just want to say I haven't had a single crash or anything related to freezes/FPS drops so those aren't affecting my review. However, if you're worried about having technical problems before purchase I'd wait until a patch is released.So far I love it, it's a solid game with a strong amount of bloodborne/demon souls feel to it, which is good for me. Will you like this if Bloodborne left a bad taste in your mouth? Maybe. The combat isn't as fast though it's preeeeetty fluid, however beyond that the game feels a lot more. grim and spooky than the previous souls games (most enemy designs would fit right into Bloodborne 2, along with a few locations if you tweaked them slightly). Once again this isn't a con much like the combat but I want to point out another similarity to the two (the inventory is also the one from Bloodborne). Basically, they learned a lot from Bloodborne and are showing it off here. I didn't want the review to be solely BloodbornexDark Souls but I've had a few friends outright put the game down because it doesn't feel Dark soulsy enough for them and too Bloodborney.Buy it if you're in the crowd who wanted Bloodborne on the computer. DAS3 is far from being a BB copy though you will get a small taste of it through this.Buy it if you just want another solid Souls game.",1

Positive,"8.5/10 Last one in the trilogy, Dark Souls III is a really nice conclusion to the series. The improved graphic quality is seen from the get-go with absolutely beautiful skyboxes and big diversity of enemies, as well as new smooth animations making the fights, both PvP and PvE a lot of fun, yet the game has some negatives as well.Finishing any NPC questlines is close to impossible without a guide, because of characters' unintuitive positioning from one part of the quest to another. The game punishes you for not looking up info if you want to get an alternative ending or finish a NPC questline.Many people complained about Dark Souls 2 world being incoherent, yet the third game suffers from it even more (DS3 has an actual explanation for it, but the explanation is quite weak).Still, the atmosphere in the game is wonderful and art design is brilliant as always, with voice acting being one of the best I've ever heard. Both main game and DLCs were really fun with some of the best boss fights in video games ever. The character movement is excellent and you can feel the weight of any kind of weapon you're using, with huge selection and diversity of those weapons.All in all, Dark Souls III is a very good closing of the series and personally almost on par with Dark Souls II. It's one of the best trilogies I've played and I'll be very eager to replay all three games in the future.""This spot marks our grave, but you may rest here too, if you would like.""PS.: Majula is still the best player's hub.",1
Positive,"I want to make a post addressing all of the new bad reviews for dark souls 3, as they fit neatly into 4 categories. The first is that the game is too hard. This would be understandable from new players, but I've seen people who claim to be veterans say the same. I am a newish player. I only got into the souls series in the last couple of months. Dark Souls 3 is not hard. I am not saying this to be facetious, I am being legitimate. It is challenging, but there is a difference. Like all souls games, if you find yourself doing really poorly over and over again, there is probably an easier way to do what you are trying. For example, I see many people playing ds3 with their shield up and just circle strafing. That works well in ds2. In ds3, the dodge key is your friend, and your shield will betray you. Try a more active playstyle. I hate to say ""git gud,"" but if you are playing passively and haven't noticed how fast the enemies are in ds3, you are either new, or have no idea how to adapt.The second argument people have is that the controls are poorly optimized for pc. To these people, I have to question if you actually play on pc. The reason is it should be obvious that you can rebind keys. It took me no time at all to find a configuration I enjoyed. For those saying go to console. I have to question your sanity. You have a pc. You can plug in a controller if you just can't be asked (though I can confirm the game is way easier on keyboard and mouse once you set the keys right). I will even point you in the right direction. set 'q' as interact, and 'e' as both back out and use items. It works wonders. Also, if your mouse has extra buttons, use them for power attacks so you can pull off weapon arts easier, as those are the only thing awkward with keyboard controls. You can get a cheap 4 dollar mouse from cyberpower pc of decent quality for gaming that has two side buttons, so cost shouldn't be an issue.The third issue people have is graphical. I'm sorry, but ds3 is a graphically intense game. You might not be able to run it on ultra settings. It isn't an optimization issue, you just have your settings too high. I can pretty much garauntee that if your card fits the minimum requirements for this game though, that you can at least achieve console quality. Obviously you can crank it up far above that with better cards. Stop saying go back to console, you have the better version, its bad advice.The final issue I have seen in the reviews is people saying ""too many cheaters, go back to console,"" or ""too much lag, go back to console."" I group these two together for a reason. I have yet to come across a single cheater. It is exceedingly rare, because the anticheat software for this game is very good. People seem to think that just because its pc, it's easier to cheat. easier is relative. It's still extremely difficult, and will still get you banned REALLY quick. As for the lag, I hate to tell you this, but it is just as bad everywhere. Every youtube video I see for pvp has at least one lagger, no matter the system. There is no magical ""lag free"" system, because people all over the world play this. I can say that ds3 will probably in the long run have the least lag on pc, because pc gamers tend to latch onto games longer and play them after the console market has moved on (this has to do with the way marketing is done to console gamers, as well as backwards compatibility in many cases).In other words, stop blaming these issues on the game, it's brilliant. It has its flaws, but these are not them. You need to, and I know you saw this coming, git gud scrub.",1

Thank you DARK SOULS III :')",1
Positive,"Dark Souls is one of the most infamous franchises in gaming for a good reason. Its environments, combat, and boss fights set the standard for other RPGs. It certainly earns its reputation for difficulty, but it isn't difficult simply because the enemies have a lot of HP or because they do a lot of damage (although they do). To git gud at Dark Souls, you have to learn the attack patterns of the enemies. Learn when to dodge, when to block, when to attack, and when to parry. Figure out a strategy and character build that works for you. When you finally beat a boss, you will know that you earned it.Welcome to Dark Souls. You're gonna die a lot.",1

Positive,"Okay so I've played lots of this game already, over 200 hours. I've 100% completed it, and I've done the same for all previous titles not including Demon's Souls because screw you Fromsoft and your Pure Bladestone.So I'm a fan of the series, it's safe to say, and Dark Souls III hits the mark for me really well. If you liked previous titles and you want more of the same, this game has it, you will enjoy it no doubt.My only complaints right now are small, and there's one huge issue with the game regarding online play. I'll get on to that after I talk about the game a little.So I started the game with very little knowledge about what to expect, and I also started alongside a bunch of friends who also bought the game. We all played our first characters solo though, so we could get a better feel for the bosses and learn the game a bit better. Without spoiling anything, this game has fan service from previous titles, and some of it is purely there to get a reaction from returning players. That was kind of a disappointment for me, but as I played on and kept reading item descriptions, some of the returning locations/items/NPCs actually made sense within the world itself. For that, I was happy. The story this time around is again, more of the same, but that is not a bad thing. I love the rich lore in Fromsoft games and I love how much love is put into item descriptions and NPC dialogue, something which you can choose to ignore or dig real deep into it and learn all the secrets about the lore.The bosses are amazing, I really enjoyed a lot of the bosses, with really only two of them lacking in my opinion. I did not like the Wolnir or Deacons of the Deep boss fights. I didn't like Wolnir's mechanics but overall was a VERY cool boss in design and concept. I didn't like the Deacons either, because well, it's a typical Fromsoft multi-enemy boss fight. The fact is (and no one likes admitting this) Fromsoft are bad at multiplayer. There's always issues surrounding the multiplayer and it's always been an issue in the previous games, and now this one. I'm not talking about balance and overall functionality, I'm talking anti-cheat and their stance on banning people. In Dark Souls: Prepare to Die edition (the first game, on PC that is) had NO anti-cheat whatsoever, so cheaters where rampant and nothing could be done about it, other than playing kiss chase off of a ledge for the hacker to die from fall damage. Fromsoft were very unexperienced in PC titles and they did a bad job of Dark Souls 1. It wasn't terrible though, because the mod DSfix cured that game. Dark Souls II was the same, it had no proper anti-cheat. Except this time around it had soft bans. The way someone was selected for a soft ban is simple, they monitored the servers and players for any suspicious activity and if they spotted something out of place and they could confirm it to be cheating. You were soft banned, but. they didn't tell you that you had been banned and you had to email Bandai Namco just to find out if you were. Obviously this system has its flaws just like any other anti-cheat system, but the big problem is the hackers were still everywhere and softbans didn't really help.Fast forward to the release of Dark Souls III and this game has had almost the exact repeated problems, except people are being softbanned for rediculous reasons, like playing in offline mode or picking up an item that they didn't know was cheated in using a third party program.At least you get an error message when there's invalid data. All you have to do is use a backed up save. What if you don't? Enjoy playing offline.To close out, all I'll say is it's the best Dark Souls to date, in my honest opinion. The issues regarding multiplayer can be solved over time, and once they are, this game will be a hell of a game.TL;DRThe game is good. Has some multiplayer issues regarding softbans. Good lore. Good Bosses. I recommend.",1
Positive,"GREAT SHOW <GOOD SHOWBAD SHOWAWFUL SHOWFirst of all, Praise The Sun! \[T]/ or whatever, before I get called a friggin' casual.Now onward to the review.It's Dark Souls, what more can you ask for?It's a HUGE improvement from Dark Souls 2, which had problems, but wasn't terrible anyway.There are complains, that DS3 feels similar to the first Dark Souls, resulting in people comparing the two.Being a Souls fan, I myself felt the similarity. But nonetheless, that is what actually makes it good.The original director of the Souls game, Hidetaka Miyazaki, returned to direct this third installment to the series, and he knew what made the first one so good. So there are bound to be similarities, although it is too much similar at certain places. The game is still different in certain places as well, especially the combat system. It's much faster than the first one, and they introduced ""Weapon Arts"". This makes the gameplay better, but may be a turnoff for some.Multiplayer has been improved tremendously, with the introduction of password matchmaking. Password matchmaking also removes level restriction, but still balances your teammate's level to yours. Which is good. The game also added more Covenants ingame, which can result up to 8 player chaotic PvP invasion. Whole lotta fun.Enemies design-wise, tons of new ones are introduced, while still having some similar mob enemies.The bosses, are a blessing and a curse, unlike DS2, which is only a curse.In DS2, most of the bosses are just ""Big dudes in big armor"". Lazy design, and not so smart attack patterns, which made them easy to handle.In DS3, it is a blessing because their design is terrific and varies throughout the whole game. It is also both a curse and a blessing, because their difficulty has been amped up, but also provides a challenge. DAMN YOU NAMELESS KING!The soundtrack is terrific, suiting the gothic theme and fantasy theme, albeit the soundtrack only plays during boss fights.Overall, great game. It has problems, especially HACKERS. That has been resolved, maybe. I don't know. And there are tons of weapons that are unbalanced or is utterly useless. Also bugs, of course there are bugs. But they are releasing updates fixing those problems quite often.Here's hoping the DLC to be a good one.",1

Positive,"Todays reviewers are 40%+ just nagging about every problem whatsoever. It crashed? Bad game. Performance issues on launch day? Bad game. A few scattered bugs? Bad game.Yea, just forget that the developers put a hellton of time into this, hard work for thousands of hours.I also had a crash, right at the start, the very first bonfire. Right before reaching it the game crashed 3 times at the exact same location, after I changed settings to Medium it worked perfectly. And since then I had one-two crashes and not a single bug.Now to the actual review.Dark Souls 3 is as the name suggests the third Souls game delivered by From Software. You'll still die a lot, no question. In my opinion DS3 is more difficult than DS2 but easier than DS1 - Casually seen.The design of every single area is gorgeous, you'll either be amazed by the view, or frightened by the atmosphere.Music is great as well, boss themes especially.The game is now way more flexible in design for Online play. In Dark Souls 2 there was the concept of Soul Memory in which you could absorve the amount of Souls you collected throughout your journey, but not only that, when being invaded, you get invaders with an equal Soul level. So you gotta spend your souls wise, don't waste them on collecting spells for achievements or lose them all accidently. Spend them on Lvling up correctly and strenghtening your weapons and armor.In Dark Souls 3 you get matched based on your Level and your weapons level - what is enough by far. I have no problem collecting every spell I come upon even as a pure melee class that doesnt use spells whatsoever.I love collecting all items in Souls games, from armour to weapons or spells - now I get to without being matched against people that just straightly leveld up - Not that it always matters, pvp is still 80% skill based.Overall I have no clue at all why this is ""Mostly Positive"", but I guess this is how the reviewing community on Steam just is like. Alltogether Dark Souls 3 is a very GREAT game, with enough content to easily justify a higher price - so stop nagging about every little problem whatsoever - It works great, way better than many other titles at Day one, and if you have some little problems, don't b*tch about it in a negative review, write a post in the discussions forum so the Devs actually notice it.Little Update:The DLCs are awesome, loved them all!",1
Positive,"Dark Souls 3 is brutal , hardcore yet addictive like previous souls games , but way better than them in many way : from the bosses ruthless design , area/world extremely detailed , interesting lore/npc to beautiful weapon art .I already made my way to undead settlement , passed the 2nd boss and haven't encounter any crashes nor framerate issues yet. The game run just fine in medium setting with 60fps on core i5, nvidia gtx 850M , 8GB RAM.Git gud, fellow DS fans!",1
Positive,"If you haven't played the others, I highly recommend you do that to acquire a basis for the lore and gameplay mechanics and how they evolve through the series.That being said, this game beautifully wraps up the series with punishing gameplay and a need to be alert at all times.Fans of the series will love this game and what it has to offer, from the classically cryptic lore the series is known for to the little things like finally being able to give all covenant related items at once instead of one at a goddamn time.\[T]/ Don't forget to Praise the Sun",1
Positive,"btw: Dark Souls 3 is a nice journey about patience, failure & success. Discover a beautiful grim world with a combat system, that let you grow on yourself. Sometimes you will cry like a baby, and in the next moment you will do the biggest flex in the world. Play it online and you will meet honorable and brave friends or the biggest dumb*ss muthaf*ckers in the universe. But let it happen. Let the game touch your soul. It is my favourite game until today! Together we will wait for Elden Ring and maby meet there! Have a nice day praise the sun",1
Positive,"This is my second favorite game I have on steam because of many reasons. First, I love the graphics of the game, I do feel like they improved them a lot from the first and second dark souls. Second, I love the weapon arts and the variety of weapons, such as the ringed knight sword and friedes scythe. Although both of those are in the DLC (I also highly suggest that you get DLCs). If you don't though, there are still other cool weapons such as the old wolf curved sword or the dragonslayer swordspear. And third, the level design is amazing, especially the area of lothric. I love how in the souls series and even elden ring, that there are so many areas where there are places in a level that make you think outside of the box. However, there are many parts of the game where it is way too easy, and there are places that you wish you could go to, but you cannot. There are so many examples of this in lothric and irithyll, it would be cool if they released another version where there are so much more areas.",1

Positive,"Dark Souls 3, It is an amazing game and definitely deserved the GOTY title. As someone who played through the entire series and enjoyed all the game. Dark Souls 3 was the easiest one to get into, and the most forgiving at the start. I also enjoy the increase in endgame difficulty that gives a challenge even to veterans of the series.9/10 good story, but the other dark souls felt like they had more of a theme or a message behind the story.Shitter Souls 3",1
Positive,"Dark Souls III takes place in Lothric, another fallen kingdom. you start out at the Cemetery of Ash, where you will have to defeat Iudex Gundyr, who is there to test your abilities to show if you're worthy of the things to come. this time you're an Unkindled instead of a near-hollow and your quest is to return the remains of the five Lords of Cinder to their empty thrones at the Firelink Shrine.the first thing you'll notice is that the pace has changed. in the first two games of the trilogoy the boss fights, and fights in general, were rather slow and you had to learn the enemies' patterns in order to survive. Dark Souls III however has taken over Bloodbornes faster movement and attack speeds.you will need ligthning fast reflexes in all the boss fights and the first few times you face them you most likely won't notice any patterns; most of the bosses also have two stages and/or you'll have to face multiple opponents at once. one example of this is the brilliant fight against the Abyss Watchers: in the initial stage you will have to face up to 3 Abyss Watchers at once (which can be easily evaded, but you have to know how). once the health of the main Watcher drops to zero, stage two is initiated. his sword starts burning, his speed becomes even faster and his attacks more aggressive and fierce than before.Dark Souls III has hands down the best soundtrack and the best lore of the trilogy. bosses like the aforementioned Abyss Watchers, Pontiff Sulyvahn, the optional Nameless King, High Lord Wolnir and the twin princes Lorian and Lothric cannot be forgotten, even if you suffer from amnesia.the locations aren't interconnected like in the other two Souls games, but they're visually varied and the level design itself is godly. there are also lots of references to the first Dark Souls, like the Firelink Shrine or a short visit to Anor Londo. you'll also encounter NPCs from the first game, like the blacksmith Andre or the (now dead) Giant Blacksmith.the atmosphere is less oppressive and the world seems more alive and seems to almost have recovered in contrast to Dark Souls II, which had a post apocalyptic fantasy vibe.I personally prefer the atmosphere and pace of Dark Souls II to Dark Souls III. if Dark Souls III was a bit more depressing, if the pace was a tiny bit slower and if you wouldn't have to face multiple enemies at the same time all the time, it would be my favorite Dark Souls by far. as it is, it's a very close second and one of my all time favorite games. - taken from my review on RPG Codex -",1
Positive,"Not going to go in-depth with this to be honest. My playtime should show how much I enjoy it. Pretty much imagine that Dark Souls 1, Dark Souls 2, and Bloodborne took turns unleashing their spunk into Demon's Souls, and you get Dark Souls 3. It's a pretty fun game. Some balance issues to be sure, but nothing a skilled player absolutely can't get past.That said, I do have an issue with it. As it stands right now, if you use an AMD CPU(except maybe a Phenom model?), you are guaranteed to get subpar performance. The game does not properly use all cores of AMD CPUs. On my FX-6300 I get good usage on cores 1-3, core 4 varies wildly, and cores 5&6 are pretty much entirely unused. And that's with a fair bit running in the background, mind. If I eliminated those processes, it would probably paint a more damning picture.So pretty much my verdict is this: If you like Souls games, get it, you won't regret it. Unless you have an AMD CPU. Then you will regret it. Dearly. At least until Fromsoft pulls their collective head out and addresses the issue.",1
Positive,"A very dark, gritty, and bru-HOO-tal fantasy world for the ""hardcore"" crowd! This game deserves two talons up, followed by a loud, resounding HOOOOOOOOT! The dark, gothic architecture is very interesting and imaginative, which lends itself well to an atmosphere of dread and horror. Dark Souls III comes with a strong, hearty recommendation, regardless of which class you choose to play. This game was definitely meant for owls and other creatures of teh night-and the challenging difficulty is somewhat legendary, yet manageable if you learn the game's various and partic-HOO-lar intricacies.Thanks for the excellent, entertaining, and sometimes frustrating, diversion Ba=mco! This game is hootiful and deadly, and deserves to be played by those gamers (and owls) looking for a dark, gothic fantasy realm with a phenomenal atmosphere and challenging, yet visceral gameplay (and boss battles).I whole-HOOT-edly recommend this game, and feel that I can safely give it 10 HOOTS out of 10!

Positive,I mean as it is common gamer knowledge dark souls is challenging. Nothing for weak nerves as i experienced with my friends already. The 5th boss run is a common reason to rage quit at these times. But if you are like me and only get more motivated to go for the next one then this is the game for you. And even if you have to take breaks in between the sweet taste of victory over that god damn bastard of a boss is a experience that can not be described. i currently have 30 hours of game time and haven't even reached the first the abyss watchers (one of the 5 main bosses for those who haven't played it yet). I'm looking forward to the day i reach the 100th hour of game time and finally beat this beast.Can totally recommed,1

Positive,"Dark Souls 3 is probably the first game that I would ever call my ""favorite."" It is rich in every category of gameplay; combat, lore, story, progression, and the feeling of community you get from the online experience. Combat is extremely flexible with over 20 types of different weapons, and every playthrough could be completely different depending on how you play and what you choose to use.The linear progression system is refreshing, and feels very well laid out. You can grind as much as you need to gain power and step up to the next boss.Co-Op is something that is very important in Dark Souls. You can run through areas with a friend, and their help is invaluable if you aren't ready for an area yet. Running solo is the classic experience, but having a friend who is willing to help makes it much more enjoyable.The graphics are very realistic, yet timeless somehow. The game still feels very up to date on graphics despite it being from 2015.The deep mechanics are something to learn and explore, and there are so many little things to do and complete in each zone. The UI seems very intimidating at first, but gets easier to understand as you learn the game and make it over the beginners curve.The curve is something to take note of. People will get this game expecting it to be hard, but not THIS hard. To get over the curve, you MUST complete at least the third boss. By then, you will already have fallen down the rabbit hole, and you won't be able to put this game down until you beat it- similar to Terraria or Valheim.The class system adds to the progression. You can find any armor or any weapon in the game, so the class you pick in the beginning only effects your starting stats and items, and you can change your entire gameplay style at any point. Souls are the ""XP"" in this game. You collect souls by killing things, which you then use as currency and leveling up your character. This means you can infinitely grind to get as many levels as you need, given that you have the patience. Weapons can be upgraded a total of 10 times, and that means you can get any single weapon and max it out to endgame level, meaning you can use any of your favorite weapons at a very high level.The online presence is hilarious most times, and if not that, charming. Notes can be left behind by players using a preset word system. You can view notes left behind by players letting you know that the chest in front of you is in fact, a mimic. Then there are other times when you receive messages like ""plunging attack required"" next to an abyss.Of course, the greatest challenge is getting through the game. So, if you are thinking about getting the game, it is worth every single dollar. (. . .but get an online key for 15 bucks)PRAISE THE SUN!",1
Positive,The best dark souls game,1
Positive,one of the easiest games ever made,1
Positive,"So, Dark Souls III. Well, there's a fair bit to say about this game. First of which, it's Dark Souls. As expected from such a game, it's not going to be easy. You will die. A lot. But you will learn from it each time. The first point to dive into is gameplay. Now, Dark Souls III is different from its predecessors in that it's far faster combat-wise. Enemies are faster but so are you, leading to faster thinking than in the previous instalments in the series. This does lead to a much more gradual adjustment to the gameplay if you played a previous title before this. For myself, I played Dark Souls: Remastered and then moved on to DS3. The pace took a while to adjust to, but it eventually clicks.Speaking as someone who currently has ~500 hours in the Dark Souls series, it's clear that these games are addicting. A lot of that time was just playing through for the first time and exploring the world, but a good chunk of it is also just going for achievements. Speaking of which, Dark Souls III is pretty rough on that front. If you plan on doing achievements, be prepared to do a minimum of three playthroughs on the same file. In order to get one achievement, you'll need to play through the game all the way through to NG+2 in order to complete it.Personally, I find it difficult to determine which of the two Dark Souls games I prefer, of the two I've played, but I think I prefer Dark Souls 3 by a margin, purely because it's more diverse. The world may not be too open like in the first game, but there are more different ways to play. More spells, more weapons, better covenants (Unless you're achievement-hunting), which all lead to more play-styles.Overall, Dark Souls III gets a high pass from me. It's fun, it's addicting, and by god, it's satisfying to play.",1

Positive,"DS3, at first glance, is better than all of the previous souls game. More epic bosses than ever, more cool looking gear than ever, refined graphics and plenty of epic locations, huge bestiary with better animations and design, a better audio quality than ever; you get the point, yet it lacks that magic DS1 brought. That magic being the level design. The way the world all connected together in DS1 was the reason the experience was so goood. It is subjective of course, but the teleporting system from region to region doesnt do it for me.Objectively speaking Dark Souls III is undoubtedly a great game. No two ways about it. Decent, it's just DS at this point, we've been able to play games with this type of gameplay since ages ago. It works, and, yes BS hitboxes are still alive and well.Good. Lacks the DS1 structure and feel but it's alright.What can be said ? Perhaps on the best depiction of medieval fantasy ? Such a claim seems reasonable enough. Visually, it's a pure treat ! From mobs, bosses, to npcs, gear, locations. No flaws. No doubts. From software on their A game, masterpiece territory.Every single aspects is good to near perfect. They continue to deliver these perfectly coherent and balanced soundtracks, with drastic rythm and ambiance changes, great NPC voice over, convincing mob sounds etc. Not a single reason to complain, excellent work !DS3 with all DLC's is quite a beast to tackle, huge amount of content plus your classic ng+ and online play.

Positive,"Dark Souls is developed by FromSoftware and published by Namco Bandi (Europe & International), Atlas (US) & FromSoftware (Japan). Dark Souls III is the third & final installment in the Dark Souls franchise. Dark Souls III takes all aspects from the other Dark Souls games and perfects them making this the best experience of the series & a worthy final installment to the franchise.The Dark Souls franchise is well know for its punishing difficulty, but is Dark Souls REALLY that difficult? Well yes, but it's not what people would intially think. Dark Souls developer Hidetaka Miyazaki insists on creating a living & believable world which is more challenging than punishing which makes its difficulty justified.Dark Souls III story centres around the player (known as Ashen One or Unkindled) waking up after the bell tolls signaling the coming end to the Age of Fire, you are considered the next in line to light the fire and prolong the Age of Fire should the first fail to complete their goal.During your quest you must defeat the 5 Lords of Cinder & rekindle the flame to start the next Age of Fire, this is considered the right thing to do, but it's up to the player to decide if they want to persue this age or if they'd rather persue one of the other endings, thus giving the player multiple choices & other reasons to play through again.From here your story becomes your own.Dark Souls III takes off putting your right in the deep end and expecting the player to learn on their own time. There's VERY little tutorial & very little explaination of where to go and what to do. The player must make their way from their awakening point to the Firelink Shrine & reignite the flame there in order to even begin embarking on their quest to reignite the flame but first comes death, then comes frustration & eventually comes success.Enemies at the start of the game are very weak and will die within 1 or 2 hits of your chosen combat style, however this won't last for long & players will eventually find themselves overwhelmed by difficult & brutal enemies which will happily gank you in large groups.If you're not willing to put in hours of time learning how to effectively stratergize and learning patterns to beat enemies this game will kick you @ss. Combat feels fluent & for most cases you'll have very little time getting a grasp of it, learning to dodge, block and parry attacks & finally learning good times to strike in order to take little or no damage. As such Dark Souls expects the player to take their time & not rush into combat head first, but rather examine their surroundings, decide on which enemies should be targetted first & then putting everything you've learned from your multiple deaths into practise and finally progressing forward.Combat in Dark Souls consists of 3 different forms Melee, Magic & Archery, each with their own various flaws and strengths in combat situations & each requiring various levelling of attributes in order to be effective with certain weapons & armour types.Bosses in Dark Souls follow different fomulas & can be overbearing to new players but with persistence can be easily & often quickly dispached of. That's not to say that the bosses are pushovers, they will by all intesive purposes kick your @ss several times until you get lucky or are able to get their attack patterns & your dodge times perfected.Dark Souls features its usual multiplayer aspect here as well, Multiplayer consists of 4 different types of interactions:Other-worldly Phantoms: The most common kind of phantom you will see are the Other-worldly Phantoms, these white phantoms will occasionally phaze in and out of existance as you progress through the game. These phantoms are other players in their own worlds in the general vacinity of you. They serve no purpose but to add to the feeling of seclusion in your own world but they can be entertaining to watch flail around on occasion.Friendly Phantoms: Friendly Phantoms will leave a glowing White or Gold sign on the ground with their White Soap Stone which you can use to summon to your world in order to Co-operate in defeating the world boss or by going through the entire stage and completing everything together. (These phantoms will generally summon with a White or Gold aura around them. They can VERY rarely be Purple as well, if you see a Purple they are considered a Mad Phantom & CAN attempt to kill you in PvP.)Dark & Mad Spirits/Phantoms: These Phantoms/Spirits are classed as ""Invaders"" they will occasionally enter your world at random and attempt to kill you, don't be fooled, these are actually players who've summoned themselves into your world so you need to be careful of what you're doing & what's around you. Dark or Mad Spirits/Phantoms will generally be Red or Purple but they can sometimes be Blue or Gold as well. (This being said not EVERY Mad Phantom or Dark Spirit that invades you wants to kill you. It can be an experience some times.)Player Messages: These glowing Orange messages exist throughout the world, some are placed by the Developers to guide newer players through the world & offer advice. Most however are placed by other players, these messages can offer advice on combat, give tips on ambushes or point players to hidden items or secret locations. Others can point players to their death so trust these messages with caution!Dark Souls is a series that not everybody will love but it can certainly be a series that will grow on you the more you play them. As somebody who used to dislike & not get the hype around the series I finally took the plunge and I can safely say I now understand what my friends were talking about when they kept raving about this game to me all those times.Dark Souls III gives you a challenge but for the most part is fair & when you die it's (MOSTLY) the fault of your own actions, occasionally the game can be cheap & let an enemy stun lock you without giving you a chance to fight back.Dark Souls III is not perfect by any means, it has its flaws & they do occasionally pop up, like delayed actions upon taking damage your action will play out after the damage animation finishes putting you right into another situation you can die from, connection time outs which can halt your progress if a Dark Spirit tries to Invade but fails to connect. But these are few and far between & can easily be overlooked when you get into the other great aspects.Dark Souls III is a beautifully crafted world, fairly detailed for the most part & has graphics that still stand out to this day for its age. There are some TRULY outstanding and beautiful section in this game that are breathtaking, Irithyll of the Boreal Valley & Anor Londo being the most standout of these places.Note: I haven't even touched on half the things in this game that I wish I had the character limit to put here, but with what I have written I'm at my maximum cap. If you want to know more then check out some reviews from people you trust.With all this said can I recommend the game?Yes this is a recommendation from me! Pick this game up whenever you can if you think you'd be interested in it.",1
Positive,"Aloha, this is my review of Dark Souls 3, where to start. It is an excellent finale to a great series. I have played the souls games since Demon's Souls but only got into the game in a big way after I played through Dark Souls. I think aside from the original Dark Souls, this is perhaps the best game in the series, and my opinion of the first Dark Souls is biased as it was what really got me excited about this series and genre of game. Therefore, if you do not have the nostalgic blinders on as I have- this may well be the best game in the souls series for you, and that is not something I say lightly. The multiplayer is fun in the same way Dark Souls 2, the lore and story are incredible just like the original, and the tone is grim just like Demon's Souls. I recommend you get the DLC and pay close attention to the ending.The Good:Perhaps the best game in the Dark Souls Trilogy.Great graphics.Tight controls.Amazing customization.Epic story.Grim and mature tone.Outstanding musical soundtrack.The Bad:PVP is favors melee classes and magic is less viable.Some of the bosses are frusterating until you figure out they are a puzzle boss, not a hit and dodge boss.The Ugly:Some of the monsters have a gross out factor that makes them much more dangerous than equally dangerous but normal looking monsters. Without spoilers, be prepared to fight.A naked man in a bathtub.A rat dying in a rat-trap.A lap dancer with a switchblade.A pile of giant babies.A gaggle of sick ducklings.A coven of grudge girls on roids.A bunch of bugs.",1

Positive,"Ok. so i just finished dark souls 3 and i dare say that this is the best game i have ever played. the experience you get through playing this is so amazing and is something i mean everyone should have done through their life. if you want to go deep you can pain your way through the first or the second game to get a small sense of what is going on. This game also has the best last boss i have ever faced. one of the only last bosses that stood up to what i would think a last boss should be, i absolutely love this game and i bet you will too, so go on and let the darkness embrace you",1
Positive,"even though it's my least favorite dark souls game, i still loved it. the addition of an fp bar instead of uses and the many battle arts was a great idea, and every boss is just as polished from the last game, with rolling becoming a rather common move to dodge the many sweeps the boss may do.the pvp, is however something i think should be worked on. certain builds are definitely broken and phantoms that are summoned are really fragile, taking a few hits means most of the time certain death, especially in pvp where the invaders took such few hits to die later in the game.the environment and areas have many, many callbacks to other souls games, EVEN dark souls 2, which wasn't ""canon"" according to the fanbase, you find things like laddersmith gilligan's corpse, creighton the wanderer, and smouldering lake just being bloody lost izalith. despite its flaws, i still loved it as a souls game, and i plan to buy the dlc when a sale comes.",1

Positive,"For anyone looking to get into Dark Souls that hasn't played the series before, do not let it scare you.I had never played a Dark Souls game before this one, and it is a fantastic game. What you hear about it being a challenge is true, but it is not a negative thing.The game is rewarding. When you beat an area or defeat a boss, you really feel like you've accomplished something. Each enemy you fight has the potentital to kill you if you aren't careful. Too often in games now the enemy AI is not actually a threat, merely a minor nuisance on the way to a clear cut story. You can master the enemies, but not without a lot of trial and error, aka dying all the time.There is much more to the game that just difficulty however. Each weapon has it's own unique set of moves and fighting styles. The weapon art in the game is fantastic, and picking a weapon can be as much about style as function if you want it to be. You can PvP and find people using all sorts of different weapons.There are also hidden items all throughout the game. If you are an easter egg hunter, you are going to love this game. You will find walls that look normal, but fade away when you hit them, and hidden paths and all sorts of little goodies.The level design is great. Coupled with the difficulty, they add in what essentially amount to checkpoints throughout the level, each one making it easier to get to the main areas final boss. You can really feel the progress you are making as you get better along the way.This is just a great game overall. The graphics are beautiful, (quite demanding though I will say, but it is well optimized) the gameplay is a ton of fun, and the replay value with new game + is through the roof. I couldn't really be any happier with a game than I am with Dark Souls. So many games have come out with a lot of hype, but this one lived up to it and thensome for me.Get this game. I don't know if it'll go on sale, but it's worth the $60 if you ask me.",1
Positive,"Better than second, worse than the first one. The advantages are: still quite hard to walk through, beautiful graphics, pvp, music, most things closer to Ds1 than 2. Disadvantages: lags in pvp, many R1 spammers, complicated lore, poise seems to not work. But they will release a patch soon that fix everyting. From my point of view 9-/10. So dry your tears and git gud casuls. And for the gods sake upgrade your computers and keep at 60fps.",1
Positive,"Much much better then Dark Souls II. You have your basic graphic improvments (similar to bloodborne if you ever played that) and gameplay improvments (good old darksouls mechanic). Bosses are much harder and unique then before. The OST is awsome as well, and is something that I felt like was missing from Dark Souls II. All in all, this was a great game and would recomend it to others like any other souls game.Some things that I kind of noticed but wasn't really bothered:-Faith builds feel a little nerfed this time around.-Invasions have no time limit. (this will either be a good thing for some, or a bad thing.)-when co-oping, when the host enters a boss fight, he may glitch through the fog wall. Making it imposible to participate in the fight. (hoping for an update on that)Overall great game. Much better then the second one. 9/10 would praise the sun again.",1
Positive,"What I liked: Better UI and graphics( DUH) Bosses are still great( two were really lame) and varied, along with the mobs The setting is still atmospheric and amazing Online works better and is so much fun(first game didn't have it when I played) Every weapon and some shields have new skills attached to them to add more variety in choses Invading as the mad phantom( hybrid) What You Need to Know: New covenant that is a mix of of white and red phantom( OMG) Humanity is replaced with ember, and no need to kindle( this is a good example of good streamlining) PC port is great, mouse is no longer annoying when using a controller like in the first game Leveling up and merchants are in one location( can't level up anywhere now) NG+ has better rings of certain types and solid soulsMasterpiecePaid: $66(Deluxe)Completed in: 40 hours Games similar: DarkMous",1
Positive,"This game was the perfect stepping stone for my 3-year old daughter to get into more isometric based horror games. I started her off on Bejeweled, but she never truly appreciated the artwork. I figured I might give her a more updated game, so I introduced her to FL Studio 9 Producer Edition. Unfortunately, she had not experienced the first 8 installments in the series, so she was completely lost in the series. Other games like Daemon Tools and LinkedIn were simply too expensive, regardless of how good gameplay they might have.However, then I discovered DARK SOULS III. This is basically the dream game for any 2-year old. It has everything she's been looking for. Regardless of what she might say, my daughter is an extremely skilled gamer and masters every game like the elitist she is. Some games like Spotify and Samsung Galaxy S7 were simply too easy to master; she beats world-level competitors for these games on the daily. On the other end of the spectrum, she couldn't even beat the final boss to games such as Skrillex and Aquafina. The skill required for DARK SOULS III is the perfect balance between Samsung Galaxy S7 and Aquafina, if I am to be perfectly honest. This game has kept my little one year old girl occupied from the day of her conception to the very present while I am writing this. She is currently ranked in the top thousand players in terms of elo rating, and she has some of the best gear I've seen in the whole Call Of Duty franchise. DARK SOULS III also offers some of the most breathtaking downloadable content available for any game I've seen. The only game that even rivals DARK SOULS III in terms of downloadable content would have to be Hotel Mario, but I will save that review for another time.However, no game is without its faults, and this game has more than I have ever seen in any film across the Federated States of Micronesia. Where do I even begin? First of all, the game is clearly optimised for the GameBoy Advance system, so the resolution scales horribly on my six 8K monitors. Secondly, the game simply CANNOT run on my Windows 2000 machine, which severely limits the portability of this game for me. Additionally, a normal QWERTY keyboard will put a hardcap on the framerate, which is actually a huge issue being that I stream with a high-speed camera. Regardless, I hope to see more Bloodborne installments in the series. Great job, Valve! You guys have really outdone yourselves this time. If more good news keeps coming like this, hopefully my wife's unborn child will survive the second coming of Christ. Ave, True to Caesar.",1

Positive,"This game feels like a remix album of FromSoft's Soulsborne Greatest Hits and its the best one [yet]. They ve nearly perfected their formula and it shows.Tight/precise combat mechanics/controls, amazing music/soundtrack, gorgeous art direction, massive layered/labyrinthine levels, and well-designed bosses/enemies: everything is [kind of] the same but with more polish and detail. Difficulty is still on the fair/challenging side and even Souls veterans will feel its sharp teeth dig in from time to time (this game has the best intro boss in all Souls games that sets the game's tone for vets and newbies alike).For fans of the Souls games, this is a must-buy. For those who haven't played a Souls game and is looking for a change of pace from your standard hack-and-slash-with-QTE-heavy-sequences RPG, this is a good place to start. Highly recommended, I'm giving it a 9/10.Good job, skeleton FromSoftware. \[T]/",1
Positive,"Pros:+ Hands down the most beautiful Soul game ever in the series. Both technically and artistically.+ Levels are well designed and fits together in a logical manner ( unlike DS2 )+ NPCs are much more likable, have more interesting quest line, which has an impact on the main quest.+ Smarter AI, and individual fight feels challenging.Cons:- Short, took me 25% less time to complete than previsous Soul games (or maybe I'm just getting good?) - Armors are meaningless, no longer upgradable. - Weapons are not as balanced as DS2, and you only see a handful used in PVP, the rest are junk.- Mutiplayer is very laggy, way worst than previous games, wonder why?- Terrible camera that cannot keep track of enemy, again, a big step down from previous titles for some reason.",1
Positive,"If you took the last five From Software titles and stacked them up side by side in a direct comparison, Dark Souls 3 would on paper come out ahead in many areas. It is evidently clear that the developers have made a concerted effort to take the successful aspects of their last several games and combine them in what they claim to be the final entry in the series. The result is the most polished and least obtuse offering so far, removing some of the needlessly cryptic aspects the series has had while maintaining a sense of narrative mystery and remaining jammed with obscure secrets. Dark Souls 3 s biggest weakness is that its formula is no longer as fresh and unique as it once was. Veterans of From Software s last several games will know exactly how to approach Dark Souls 3. However the formula is still a good one, and it is executed brilliantly here, with only a handful of missteps to bother you throughout your journey.continue reading[www.newgamenetwork.com]",1
Positive,"Dark Souls III has uniform boss design across the board. They're all giant humanoid knights wearing armor while wielding swords and shields. They all have similar 10-strings. Dark Souls III gives the player what they want! This is peak aesthetics and enemy design! More variety would would muddy the water. Knights are key. Key to the world of dark souls. Embrace the giant humanoid knights, and forget the bosses of olde. Dragons, Piles of bones, Sooth the Tooth, attractive spider ladies, giant sword wielding dogs, masses of excretion, Manus, various stray demons, these are all designs with no guidance.

Positive,"Very good game. I'm not sure if it was easier than DS1 and Bloodborne, or if I have just gotten gud, but it didn't seem nearly as challenging as those two. Beat the final boss on my first shot, beat the dragon rider third try, etc. Still an excellent game and I would recommend to anyone who is a fan of DS1 or Bloodborne.",1
Positive,"Hundreds of hours later, my opinion of the game definitely has changed.The overall level design can be a little flat here and there, and the cosmetically they seemed to really struggle with making hills, valleys, and cliffs. However you'll still find no lack of beautifully designed areas.Weapon design throughout the entirety of the game was and has always been amazing, alongside the large selection of armour you have to choose from. Weapon movets are re-used on a regular basis in dark souls, because of this its more likely you'll find the perfect weapon for you. However the re-used weapon arts quickly became frustrating.Both DLCs are very enjoyable and replayable, I do find they are short and are unfortunatly specifically focused on new areas rather than adding to existing ones.Balance changes have been added quite often and fixed a lot of the issues I originally had with the game. Personal Side Notes:I found that the copy and pasted boulders littered across the cliff sides looked somewhat ugly and out of place.The textures for different armour sets could have been more similar, allowing prefectionists such as myself to combine different sets without desliking the differences in metalic shade or texture quality. (chain armour)Not including poise as it originally was in previous titles was a poor choice.Different weapons with different designs should have unique weapon arts at least. I didn't like how a lot of the great hammers were simply given perseverance as an example.Although I don't want to \[T]/ praise \[T]/ this game as something it's not, its definitely a dark souls title, and they achieved at least living up to that standard. All it really took for me to appreciate this game was a second look, some friends, and a little less pessimism. If you have the game already and have a bad impression of it, I highly suggest giving it a second chance with a friend(s), and take the game slow to more precisely develop your own opinion on the games mechanics, aesthetics, and level design. It's dawned on me that there really isn't a single souls title I wouldn't recommend to a fantasy lover, so yes. It is definetly worth the purchase. '",1

Positive,"Dark souls, I wouldn't describe this game as hard even though it is. I would describe it as challenging, unforgiving, and adventuress. In my opinion The dark souls games are the final remnants of the old school RPG's. I grow so tired of games putting me on rails and holding my hand through the entire process never truly letting go. Like Skyrim for example, how many quests in Skyrim were spoon fed? The answer is ALL of them. Remember when games were about more than just the ride? When killing dragons was hard? When Death was more than just a simple inconvenience? When beating a game was a challenge and not just how many hours you put into it? Do you miss that feeling?!?!

Positive,"Here we go again. The name says it all. It's Dark Souls for the third time and that's pretty much what you get: demanding melee combat reliant on timing, rewarding exploration, cryptic lore, fashionable armor and medieval-themed environments that are as beautiful as they are deadly. There are differences to previous games, however. But they're not nearly as striking as the similarities.Dark Souls 2 received a lot of flak for its uninspired environments, its floaty, somewhat cheap combat and the lack of enemy variation. It's great to see that Dark Souls 3 improved on most of those complaints. Decrepit castles, dimly-lit chapels or moldy dungeons - as usual, the selection of areas sounds like fantasy standard, but the way in which they are presented certainly is outstanding. On many occasions the player will stop what he's doing to soak up the atmosphere. Meanwhile, From Software has actually increased the combat's floatiness and it's easy to see why: Bloodborne happened - the game that took Dark Souls's formula and made it faster and more frantic, so of course Dark Souls needed to keep up. Enemies have shorter wind up phases resulting in much shorter windows for counter attacks, so combat in general requires you to be quick on your feet. It all plays into shields being kind of unimportant in Dark Souls 3. They're viable for fending off groups of smaller enemies, but when it comes to large enemies or bosses, you really want to master dodging since the stamina loss from blocking a hit is much more severe.In terms of difficulty, Dark Souls 3 is demanding but fair for the most part. Still, some of the cheapness introduced in Dark Souls 2 remains. The attacks of some enemies cover easily 75% of the area around their bodies and they can attack seemingly without running out of stamina. However, enemies like these are few and far between. Also, the advantage you gain from leveling up or upgrading your weapon is noticeable, but barely enough to make a difference in the early stages of the game. I returned to an area after ten level ups and three weapon upgrades and it still took me three hits to down a common enemy. Also, sometimes enemies tend to be damage sponges.Despite the differences, Dark Souls 3 plays like a greatest hits compilation. It features many callbacks to previous games, which is expected from a sequel to some degree, but it's arguable whether or not those callbacks were executed with grace. Often situations or characters are replicated with few variations, suggesting From Software is running out of things to show us. Even Demon's Souls gets referenced on some occasions. If you've played a Dark Souls game, barely anything this one throws at you will come as a surprise. A large swamp area where the water slows down your movement while gradually poisoning you? Never seen that before. Which is a bit disappointing considering that Bloodborne took the established formula and added its own unique twist to it, making the experience fresh anew. Basically, Dark Souls 3 is more of the same. If you don't insist on it reinventing the wheel, you will have a grand time.",1
Positive,"Dark Souls 3 is a masterpeice. First off let me say yes this is my first Dark Souls game WAIT HOLD THE PITCH FORKS I GET IT. After concluding my first playthrough of this game which was about 65 hours for me was an amazing experience. Let me list the following about this game to make it easier.Graphics: The graphics in the game are magnificent I can't say it enough the enemies, npcs, landscape, armors, and weapons all come togethor to really solidify this amazing experience.Difficulty: After playing this game for over 90hrs I can easily say I am not an expert I am just starting my NG with the chararcter, but I can say this game will beat the dog shit out of you if you don't keep your wits about you. For example I could die to a boss and my souls then drop in the spot I died and I decide to give it another try and grab my souls but, to my dismay I am eviscerated by a hollow with a long stick. Now you can imagine the amount fucking anger that currently resided in my body was at an all time high and it was BUT I LOVED EVERY SECOND OF IT! Everytime I died I never left the game in anger it only called me in more to figure out strategies or trying to get lucky every once and a while and not many games can manage to be this unforgiving and have players glorify the game just for that reason it's spectacular.Boss Fights: HOLY SHIT. The bosses in this game are great but there are a few exceptions (DEACONS) but, I can say I had a lot of fun with everyone zero of these fights were boring and defeating a boss gives you a real feeling of accomplishment especially when I can say with full confidence I died 7 times to the first boss and loved every death it took. The boss fights are one of the big highlights of this game and it executes it extremely well to the point that I was really excited to start my new game just so I can get my ass handed to me again.Game mechanics: Look a lot of people might say that ew don't play with keyboard thats complete horse shit I played this game with both keyboard and a controller and I found both to be quite similar and either will do, the game's menu and inventory isn't really keyboard and mouse friendly but once you get the hang of it your in the clear.Servers: Dark Souls 3 servers can be questionable at time connecting to friends and dueling online can sometimes not work well for me it was a 50/50 but more times than not it worked out fine there was a few times where I would join a friends game only to be booted of immidietely but after a couple tries it was just fine. There are also sometimes when being invaded it looks like the invader is just floating through time but those were few and far between for me.In conclusion I did buy this game on sale but after playing it I would have gladly payed the 60$ price tag, this kind of beauty in a game is uncommon these days so I would definitely pick this game up at any time possible. You will not be dissapointed.",1

Positive,This is what Dark Souls II should have been.,1
Positive,"This game is amazing. Not sure why it doesn't have 95 percent or above. Quite difficult, punishes you heavily for mistakes but rewards you when you complete bosses. Really fun, great cinematics on bosses. 60 dollars is pretty expensive, but it is a really good game if you like challenging games and are willing to spend the money. But you should defnitely have a controller if you want to play, makes the game a lot better.",1
Positive,"For the longest time I had put off playing Dark Souls. I had heard it was great but didn't feel like it was something I would be interested in because I had heard how hard and infuriating it was. I even got Dark Souls 1 on Xbox 360 for free and after 10 minutes I had rage quit and refused to ever play DS again.Fast forward to winter, 2017: My close friend (also a souls virgin) had bought DS3 and would not shut up about how amazing it was. It took some convincing but he eventually convinced me to purchase the game that I had sworn never to play again. Official Review Starts Here Almost immediately after being thrown into the game I was met with enemies which endlessly slaughtered me. Cut up, burned, pushed off cliffs, Dark Souls 3 did everything to me. At least 50 deaths before I reached the first boss. I will take a moment here to mention there is a learning curve to this game but after a few hours, you will learn the basics. Without spoiling much about the story, I can tell you that you will need to make important decisions and strategically plan your attacks and routes while still a noob. It took me 10 hours of grinding and practicing on lesser mobs to finally kill the first boss. After I had finally felt confident about the skills I had developed, DS3 changes up game mechanics and introduced new fighting styles and mobs. Pretty much everything but the characters in the game are beautiful and almost always, I found myself pausing to take in the breathtaking views and artistry put into the meticulously crafted building and levels. For players who find themselves having difficulty sticking to a certain play style, in PVE, it is fairly easy to spread levels around to be able to use either a sword or be able to wield fire. The customization possibilities available from the beautiful matches of armor make me feel like my warrior is truly real while she struggles to triumph over those who stand in her way, both good and evil. All in all, Dark Souls 3 had brought me a tremendous amount of happiness and will always have a special place in my heart. Although I was resistant and worried about the difficulty at first, as I progressed and learned, the difficulty made me cherish the game even more and is possibly why I love this game so much.",1
Positive,"I really love this game. Some say it doesn't compare to the masterpiece that was the first Dark Souls and I can agree on some points. The first Dark Souls game was amazing story-wise and it's incredible world building. The reason I recommend this game is because I feel it is better than Dark Souls II, with hackers at a minimum it is easy to enjoy the whole purpose of the game which is to git gud. This game is harder than the previous games in my opinion.",1

Positive,"Yeah this game clears Elden Ring by far. If you played Elden Ring and want to play a game with real replay value that doesn't require you having multiple tabs open to be able to build craft and know where every single item drop you need is then play this. Probably the most well crafted Souls experience to this day, the only con I would say is worth mentioning is the lack of poise. The game is handled at a much faster and aggressive rate though so you'll want to be dodge rolling most things instead of tanking them anyways. If some moron like me can spend 400+ hours in this game after having it be my first souls game ever on Xbox back in the day with probably the same hours put in, AND I still get enjoyment out of it, chances are you picking it up for the first time after playing Elden Ring (or never playing a souls game) will grant you the same enjoyment. TL;DR: Definitely worth full price, especially worth on sale at half price. Buy it.",1
Positive,"There are literally no issues here somehow, I'm just as surprised as you are~The story and lore is extremely complex, if you have seen my review on Elden Ring then you sure know I won't start to explain it here because there are many Youtube channels for that~ The gameplay is what I would call the most refined, it doesn't bring many new things compared to older Souls games but what it takes on, does it the most perfectly~ It has tons of weapons, some spells and miracles but half of them are D tier or lower and the game has nowhere as many bosses as Elden Ring or Dark Souls 2 so that's maybe a letdown for some players, for me it wasn't since those bosses are all different and well made except 2 of them~The multiplayer formula is made up from:A host: Plays the game normally~Summons (White, Sunbro and Mound-makers who can act as an enemy~): Can be called as a help by a host~Blues (BotDM and Blue Sentinels are the same~): Can be automatically summoned into a host's world if they have the Way of Blue covenant equipped~And invaders (Watchdogs, Aldrich and the normal red~): They can invade a host's world with the purpose of killing them~Now after this little lesson I will explain more, the reason why new players will hate this and veterans mostly love it is because of the tremendous amount of PvP glitches there are: Estus Cancel, Estus Refill, Bow machinegun, RKSS Cancel, Ring of Favor swapping, Animation swap, Tumblebuff and so so very much more~ None of these will ever be fixed, and because of that veteran players learned them and use them frequently and for new players this will seem very unfair and horrible, and veterans mostly play as invaders and newbies as hosts with some summons~The game clearly worth the price and it sometimes gets a 75% off, that's huge so if you have the chance, then I can only recommend playing this game, I had lots and lots of fun with it, several NG+X and challenge runs, months of PvP and also some mods~",1

Positive,"So, after ammassing this much of a playtime and this much fun from this game, I think it's time to leave a reviewDark Souls 3, is not a perfect game. Balance and content issues are all around, and arguably the older games were better. But I still love it and play it far too much. Why? Well, there are a lot of reasons. It's my first Souls game, which leads me to not be able to see a lot of its flaws, and I do love the combat of this series, which is probably some of the best I've ever said. This isn't a game for everyone, but it's definitely worth trying at least. I can't promise you'll enjoy your time, but it'll be a damn experienceP.S. GIT THE FUCK GUD YOU CASUL",1
Positive,"Honest review: -Gameplay is amazing (as precise as DkS1, as fast as BB, as . well its not like DkS2)-I have only had 1 situation where the boss hitbox was bullshit-Difficulty is exactly how it should be-Level design is a bit too straight forward at times, but mostly on par with DkS1 (you travel for hours and suddenly you are back at the beginning, opening a shortcut)-Story is exciting but not very deep (measured at a normal game, but hey its a souls game)-If you have played more than 200h each game of the series (DS,DkS,DkS2,BB) you will see sooooo many references and reoccurances, FromSoft really knows how to tickle that nostalgia nerve",1
Positive,Over 300 hours and I still fucking suck. I completed this game by sheer luck. Still pretty good tho.,1
Positive,Gud game but invasions are way too easy. I just hit them with my broadsword twice and they're dead!,1
Positive,"Absolutely phenomenal. This is a beautiful game and at times almost artistic, though like all the games, it not without its flaws, mainly PvP balance. The removal of poise was a hard pill to swallow, but it makes a lot of sense now that I've played PvP for longer. I cannot recommend this high enough. I will be playing this game until the day the servers die.",1
Positive,"Dark Souls III is a fantasy RPG game, the fourth one in the series (if you count Demon's Souls). You kill enemies and collect souls to purchase new armor and level up your character. That is not anything particularly special, however the series is renowned as being difficult. This difficulty is derived from the lack of consistent healing and the necessity to plan out and play carefully. The enjoyment in Dark Souls is from the bosses, and the gratification of defeating them, especially if it took many tries. In this review I will determine whether or not the game lives up to its predecessors.+Bosses are generally varied, with different arenas, styles, and novel mechanics+Best visuals thus far+Faster paced mechanics decrease sluggish feeling from previous titles+PVP provides great replay value+Many weapons to choose from+DLC section is fun, but nothing exceptional+Interesting regions and 'levels'+Armor is fun to stylize with+Low-level enemies are varied and interesting+Incredibly immersive and atmospheric throughout the game-Ending(s) are modest and uneventful-Easier than previous games to appeal to casual players+Faster paced mechanics lead to incongruity with different weapon types (negligible)-No weapon durability mechanic-Online issues with potential bans and cheaters-Instant swapping weapons during swings opens up potential exploits-Certain items are locked behind covenant rewards that take way too long to fulfillDark Souls III is a great installment in the series. It is faster paced than Dark Souls I & II, mechanically speaking. I had a lot of fun playing PVP with friends and randoms online, but there are glaring vulnerabilities and exploits that can lead to an unfair ban on your account. DSIII has a ""three-strike"" system, and I received one strike when I picked up an item from a cheater. All in all, it's a fantastic game, it has an interesting DLC, and it is certainly worth purchasing and playing- preferably right now.",1
Positive,"Never played a Souls game in my life, including Bloodborne.Decided to give this one a shot since I was itching for a good single player experience.Play the first 8 hours with extreme frustration, having 5 of those 8 hours be nothing but dying and loosing souls.Get in the zone one saturday and play it non stop for 20+ hours.Finish the game a day after feeling very accomplished.Just get it if you like action adventure games or if you grew up playing Zelda.",1
Positive,"i love the mechanics, difficulty, and story",1
Positive,"One of the best game expirience i ever get. Beautiful art, challenging fights and great soundtracks. it's brilliant!",1
Positive,"this is the best fromsoft game ever made, it is a master piece everything about it is perfect. All boss fights are an experience you would only see in few other games (especially gale). Would highly recommend to everybody.",1
Positive,One of my favorite video game franchises! I enjoyed the third installment of Dark Souls just as much as the first two games. Bandai Namco remains true to the path and refines Dark Souls even more in this 3rd epic journey through your own levels of patience and determination.,1
Positive,"My honest review and opinion of Dark Souls IIIIf you just want to know it it s good and worth playing, YES, it is.Now to the ""review"" part.I have to mention, that this is the VERY FIRST souls like I ve ever played, which is why it has a special place in my Heart. When I first started playing the game, I thought it was good idea to play it with Mouse and Keyboard.It wasn t. In the first few hours I got owned by the Tutorial Boss, locking on and dodging were foreign words to me.Some hours later, I opened the doors of Lothric and got hit with the breathtaking view of Lothric Castle in the Distance.I got my first pieces of Armor, Shields and Weapons, and made my way through the High Wall of Lothric. Until this Point the Game was fun, but left me with the feeling of ""thank god it s finally over"". That changed when I encountered the Abyss Watchers. This Boss took me at least 40 tries to beat, but the feeling of victory, the rapidly beating heart and adrenaline rush was more than worth the struggle. Even though it s just a game, I was sitting in front of my Desk, screaming ""I DID IT"" for 2 minutes straight to my friends in VC. After the Watchers I purchased their sword and spent many hours by spinning my way through the following areas. Pontiff took me some tries, but wasn t too bad. Right after Pontiff I got invaded by some guy who quickly noticed that I had no clue what was going on, who he was and why he was in my world. In the end he escorted me all the way to Anor Londo, dropped me a Large Soul of a Hero and black crystald out. Absolute Chad <3Many hours later I reached Grand Archives and struggeled with Lothric and Lorian, until it ""clicked"". Despite having an Elevator, the way back to the Lothric and Lorian Bossfight is unnecessarily long and packed with enemies. Why Miyazaki, why. After the Twin Princes it was time for the final Boss, and my god, this fight was so good. Soul of Cinder kept surprising me with several mid-phase changes between ""classes"" but was a great experience to fight. Some time after beating the game, a friend gifted me the DLC s and a had more content to dive into. The DLC s were great, had many cool weapons, especially the Ringed Knight ones. Sister Friede took me some tries and surprised me with THREE FUCKING PHASES, but went down relatively quick. The Ringed City had it s highs and lows, but rewarded me with one of the cooles Bosses I ve ever fought in a Game. Slave Knight Gael took me hours, but holy shit, this fight was an absolute trip and I wish I could fight it again for hours. This fight, the music, the moves and Gael switching weapons MID AIR made this my all time favourite Soul Boss. After beating Vanilla Dark Souls III and the DLC s, I wanted to take some time off, but couldn t stop thinking on how play it again, more efficiently, using different weapons. New Game plus, despite being the exact same but a bit harder, was still an absolute blast. I rolled through the Game with the Black Iron set, Havels Ring and Heavy Caestus +10, buffed with Lightning or Poison. Past obstacles like Pontiff were a lot easier now and more fun as well. Just imagine beating up a 5m Tall priest with Fire and Magic swords while wearing Boxing Gloves with Metal Notches inside them, it felt so damn good.After beating several new games, I forced some friends to play Dark Souls with me and it was a whole new experience. Despite some arguing against it, Dark Souls is even more fun when you re playing with friends, goofing around and beating the game dressed up as Peasants, armed with nothing but a flaming pitchfork. The PvP Experience is also surprisingly good in Dark Souls 3, some encounters end rather quick or even get resolved by one of the players beginning to emote. I m not an active pvp player and yet I have to say it s fun, even Invasions can be fun. Some Invasions had actually respectful individuals that bowed down and waited until I cleared out nearby mobs to 1 v 1 them afterwards. And then there are these individuals that invade with cheats, such as using Estus Flask SEVENTEEN TIMES, having infinite stamina or reviving themselves after being killed, just to instantly apply the curse effect on you and the point down. These Individuals are lower than low and have to Cheat in pvp, then point down in order to feel anything in their lives. The only two things I dislike about this game are cheaters in PvP and the fact that this game DOESN T HAVE CLOUD SAVE. Fromsoft please, with Dark Souls ""remastered"" you pretty much released the exact same old game and it has cloud save. Every now and then I still start a new DS3 run and get reminded of how much fun this game can be. 9/10 for me.",1
Positive,"I am 69.My ex-wife and I have adopted both a son and daughter together. They are now both 5 years old.When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some drywall in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand. my working hand. my games hand. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest gamer with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot. I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 7 ing minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the parent I needed to be in that moment, not the weak drywall-puncher I was behaving as.Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 5 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.Thank you.",1

I'm writing this about a year after my first gameplay and I still want to keep playing, try new different builds and try other weapons. The story line is beautiful, I mean, How could you tell a story through the gameplay without use cinematics trying to explain everything? Well, Dark Souls III have done that, masterfully. I thought it was very struggle for games to be ""art"" or telling a story using just the gameplay, the scence of a videogame, but this change my mind. The gameplay is fast, if this is your first Dark Souls (my case) it is tough to learn but rewarding. Don't be worried if you didn't play the first two games, you're gonna enjoy this one because the story line is complete by itself. I'd pay even more than his price to play this game again if I could so, I highly recommend it.",1

Positive,Worth Every Riyal.,1
Positive,"PROS:- Incredible combat and responsive controls- Great atmosphere (level and sound design)- Minimalist plot (yay for no long cutscenes), but surprisingly deep lore- Quite difficult but never unfair, progress is very satisfying- Cool summon/invasion system adds co-op and PvP elements into the game, making it feel like a hybrid single-player/MMO gameCONS:- Some areas and enemies can be more annoying than hard- Online quality (summon/invasion system) is inconsistent; can be laggy and frustrating- Sidequests, while certainly not the focus of the game, can be insanely obscure and easy to missVERDICT:This is the greatest action RPG I've ever played. The difficult (but extremely satisfying) combat and co-op summon system in particular kept me playing for hundreds of hours. For those of you like me who value gameplay over everything else, this is the RPG you've been looking for.",1
Positive,"Dark Souls 3 is the culmination of the dark souls trilogy. Fromsoftware has through the last 2 games and bloodborne figured out how to handle the souls series, and it shows. The combat has never been more well handled, which is not saying it doesn't have some flaws I'm simply saying it feels responsive and is very rarely clunky. If there is one thing I would critizise it is the progression and build varierity , it feels like they went a bit too safe with early game build and routing variety which can sometimes feel a bit bland. However the quality of bosses and ingame locations/lore is simply amazing as to be expected of the souls series, npc questlines are not as obscure as they were in previous titles which makes it easier to follow the questlines.I really recommend that you try this game, and if the difficulty is scaring you I can safely tell that dark souls is not what game journalists make it out to be, it's challenging yeah but far from ""impossibly difficult"".",1
Positive,"Looks good, runs well (only 2 crashes in 20+ hours), decent FPS (More than I expected out of my rig) and it's really fun.I recommend.",1
Positive,"I ve been playing the Souls series since Demon s Souls. I ve invested hundreds upon hundreds, if not thousands, of hours across all platforms that the games have been available on. Many souls have been lost, many curses thrown, many quits incited by rage. Playing through Dark Souls 1 for my first time was one of the most intense experiences I have ever had. I spent countless hours attempting to beat Ornstein and Smough, those brillaint combatants When I finally beat them, it was the best feeling a videogame had ever given me. Playing through Dark Souls III has been such a phenomenal experience, and I know it shall continue to be so. It is bringing back that constant joy/anger of being destroyed and then going back and destroying the once destroyer. It is allowing me to relive the feeling of beating that boss whom I had been trying to beat for so long now. Though at the time of writing there is one boss whom I am yet to beat, he shall remain nameless for now. I am yet to venture into NG+ as I m trying to beat all the bosses. Being able to relive all those brilliant feelings is making this game truly phenomenal.Now, down to the nitty gritty stuff. Be warned there will most likely be minor spoilers ahead. Performance Bear in mind I do have a fairly beefy pc; check my profile for the specs.Having played upwards of 50 hours at the time of writing, I have only encountered one area where I suffered frame rate issues. These issues were rather short lived, and did not cause any major hassle thankfully. They occurred in the Lothric Castle area, pushing from the Dragon Barracks bonfire into the castle proper. Gameplay During my 50+ hours of gameplay, there have been a few issues with hitboxes with certain enemies, one enemy that irked me the most with this issue was the Reptilian wolf thing on the bridge into Irithyll of the Boreal Valley. This mob caused a few issues with its body causing damage during weird moments where I should not have taken harm. I ve also noticed the classic extra range thing that some weapons have, though with this being a recurring thing through Souls games it isn t too much of an issue.Multiplayer wise I have encountered a few issues. (This could technically come under performance. Though it could well be my internet) During co-op I was often summoned and when my host entered their boss battle I would be unable to pass through the boss fog. This is a particularly annoying one as I had it affect me as a host a few times. I would summon someone to help out, and they would be glitched outside of the boss fog, unable to join. This issue was often accompanied by the no animation bug that I had found to be rather prevalent in multiplayer. However the animation one seems to be far less common, if it s around at all that is. Balance As far as I can tell, weapon balance is perfectly fine for PvE. I can t say much for PvP however, due to the rampant hackers frightening me away from it. Armour is less balanced; there is the commonly known poise issue, and I ve seen some things on a problem with physical reduction. The poise one is basically where armour/stat poise does not actually do anything, however weapon/spell buff poise does indeed work. So it s a weird situation there.Npc summons are far more accessible in this game, which makes certain boss battles far too easy in my opinion. I found with the Deacons of the Deep boss fight, summoning Anri or Syrris made the fight easy to the point where you could essentially have the summon do the entire battle for you. This is, personally, an issue as it takes away any semblance of challenge from certain boss fights. It s a similar scenario with a few other bosses. Lore As with all Souls games the lore, albeit hard to come by, is rich and fulfilling. With ties to all the classic games, it manages to span stories from Dark Souls one, and mixing in locations and characters from the previous games. It reinvents and revitalises old characters, it ushers in new and complex characters. One thing I did find to be lacking was the dialogue from the NPCs. Upon completing rather significant events their dialogue options would barely change. This is quite unlike FromSoft as many of the NPCs in their other games changed their dialogue when you performed certain tasks. They do however, bring back the classic souls quest lines where you just hopefully stumble upon someone in their time of need and can help them out, all to hopefully receive that Titanite Slab at some point down the line.Dark Souls III is a perfect entry in a phenomenal franchise, and brilliantly fitting end to the series. It perfectly incorporates the challenge that the Souls Veterans are hoping for, and it has that slight edge for the newer players who want to get into it but are far too intimidated by the intense challenge. It s got a warm and welcoming community that is always keen to help. It boasts a brilliantly smooth combat, levelling, upgrading, and exploration range. With a story that spans multiple games, it s got that little bit of lore that ll bring you back and keep you speculating for years to come. All in all it s one heck of game, packed full of content, and with DLC down the line it s only going to get more and more intense!I give it a 10/10, but hey I m biased. These are my favourite games ever!Keep an eye on this review as I will be updating it when the DLCs are released",1
Positive,"Performance review: Runs fine for me most of the time, in some areas the framerate dips below 60 and 50 to the low 40's. And there is some annoying stuttering and fps drops when exiting menus and dialog boxes too fast. But atleast I have not experienced any crashes so far.I hope they will fix the performance issues in the near future because there is no reason this game should drop below 60 fps on my machine (2x 980's and a 5820k).Game critique:Although I'm not anywhere near completing the game, I'm still going to comment on my experience thus far.I am somewhat annoyed on how extremely linear the game is from the start, only giving you access to 1 area. You won't be given the option to explore different areas until after the 3rd boss. Comparing this to the original Dark Souls, where you can access several different and diverse areas as soon as you arrive to Firelink Shrine. Even Dark Souls 2 lets explore different areas, and I remember people complaining that game was too linear.Thankfully the game makes good use of shortcuts and diverging paths, a bit of an over abundance of Bonfires though. Seems to me that the developers use them as a bit of a crutch, since you also get the ability to warp between Bonfires right from the start.Another thing that bothered me, was that you discover several NPC's who are locked away in cells and cages. If you find the key or the path around the locked door, you will be given the option to befriend and learn new things from them.When you do this though, they warp back to Firelink Shrine right infront of you. This really breaks my immersion because if they are locked away and trapped, but then warp away after you have unlocked the whatever thing that was keeping them from leaving, why wouldn't the NPC just warp away without you having to unlock the door for them. You could argue that they had lost all hope, and was at the brink of hollowing until you found them. And they regain their spark after you agree to help or whatever.But this still doesn't justify them just warping away. This wasn't a problem in the previous titles because the NPC's you meet travel back to Firelink Shrine or Majula after you have left the area. Leaving it up to the players imagination to conjure up how they got there. This is a much more elegant solution in my opinion. It doesn't ruin the players immersion, unlike when you unlock a gate to an imprisoned NPC and then having him or her simply warping away, effectively ruining the players sense of accomplishment.I know I went on a long tangent about such a small difference, but that is because I feel that it is worth highlighting these flaws in an otherwise amazing game.The developers have made several other great and much welcomed changes in other major aspects of the game and it's mechanics. I would love to go on and on about what I love about this game, but it is much better to experience this for yourself.Though I would hold off until there is a fix for the crashes and stuttering.",1

Having played and thoroughly enjoyed Dark Souls Remastered, I was greatly looking forward to playing this one. My expectations were met and I had an amazing time with this game.

Positive,"One of the themes of Dark Souls is cycles; if enough time passes certain events, people and places are likely to repeat. It is also a series about death and rebirth. If From Software is to be believed, Dark Souls III is the death of this franchise and I have to say I'm glad. Now don't get me wrong, I really like this game (not quite as much as the original) but the franchise appears to be running out of ideas.The story is a continuation on the dying fire needs rekindling theme with no major additions to the lore, or explanations for why this is happening. This show, don t tell approach worked amazingly well in the original but this is the third game in the series and some answers would be nice. Items, characters and locations also repeat with little rhyme or reason. Are they connected to the originals world and if so how much time has passed? What happened?In its favour DS3 has the most interesting location and monster design (in terms of visuals) so far in this series and the Cathedral of the Deep is some of the best level design. Combat is a mixed bag and often leads to spamming light attack especially in pvp. The faster pace occasionally makes things more exciting but I miss poise and blocking.This is still a good end to the series and is well worth checking out if you re a Souls fan; just don t expect to be blown away in the same way as you were with dark Souls.",1

Positive,"Ahhhh. Dark Souls 3 - the only game I regret not buying at first time, but playing cracked when it got released.Since I have much more than 215 hours (around 700), I think it is time for a review from me.- Awesome Lore / Story : Masterful indirect storytelling! Dark Souls 3 not only features a the reworked story of Dark Souls 1, but also adds more to the general Lore.- Good and enjoyable graphics : Typical for a soulsborne title. It emphasizes the general idea of the game and delivers pleasant experience, and also : we all know that a good game is not only about good graphics.- The combat system : It is very well made, easy to learn and is close to realistic ( despite some differences )- The RPG experience : Dark Souls 3 brings more to the RPG experience, despite that the whole idea is dependant on the player`s decision on how to play the game.- Well thought areas : the atmospheric feeling is top of the line- Good PvP arenas ( They could have made more )- Difficulty : when it comes to difficulty. in my opinion Dark Souls 3 is more ""noob friendly"" than the other titles. *Which is good! Some players think that it is a little bit too easy, but that is why we have mods, levels and customizable characters.- Music : As expected - the soundtracks are STUNNING! They totally fit with the boss types and the general emotions.- Since I have no serious negative remarks I should put this here : WHY NO MASK OF THE FATHER?!",1

Positive,"Secondary and final edit: From Soft has officially taken notice of the issue and is working to patch it out. This review was for nothing other than hoping to spread a bit of awareness, but with the company taking notice and working to do something about it, this is no longer necessary. I will not be looking at this review any longer. Glad to see it happen for a game that I've enjoyed for so long.Important edit: Blue Sentinels have officially dropped a patch to prevent this from happening, check them and their community out if you play dark souls online frequently.MASSIVE EXPLOIT. People are able to remotely run code through the online of souls games, meaning your data and information are at risk just by playing online with other people. From Soft has not been known for patching things, but with a serious problem like this, there needs to be enough of an outcry for them to do something about it. This ALSO will likely apply to Elden Ring. If there is even a chance other people see this and follow suit, need to get the message through to the team somehow.",1
Positive,DARK SOULS III is the Dark Souls III of the Dark Souls franchise.,1
Positive,10/10 would game again,1
Positive,"Between 8am and 5pm I go to this funny smelling building that people call work.Then at 5:30 I come home, feed the dog, feed myself (sometimes) and then begin my actual real job.Blue Bro'ing in DS3. Please give me my life back FromSoft",1
Positive,"Dark Souls III is the final culmination of the Soulsborne series, and what a journey it is. Dark Souls III begins something like Dark Souls, with the player awakening and regaining consciousness in the middle of nowhere. The world of Dark Souls III is even more hostile and inhospitable as the first or second game, and any allies you find will be few and far between, and those you think of as allies might be something else entirely.This game ramped up the Berserk references to 11, as the player even does battle with demons that look like they were taken directly from the pages of Berserk; and yes, they will slaughter you. In Dark Souls the world was already falling apart, in Dark Souls II you saw even more destruction as even once mighty cities lie under oceans of water and even lava, but in Dark Souls III the world is at its breaking point. Entire mountains and continents have fallen away and left behind strange pillar-like towers and castles jutting into the sky with no surrounding land, portions of the buildings themselves even falling away. This is the end of the world, and you think you have the mettle to do something about it?Graphically the game is very beautiful, there's a lot of eye candy, no longer dealing with the limitations of the Playstation 3 and Xbox 360, they certainly decided to take advantage of the platform advantages of the PS4 and Xbox One, which allows for the PC version to be so good. Unfortunately it's one of the most intensive games I've ever seen, so you're going to need a GOOD video card, the requirements are not fudging the numbers at all when they say you need a 750 or better.Sound design too is really good, creepy sounds in the distance, the screams, the sounds of dripping water, boiling lava and the scraping of metal on stone. It'll put you on edge. The music is fairly decent too, I might say that the Dark Souls III music rivals the Dark Souls soundtrack, and they certainly leveraged the music in ways they didn't do in any previous games.The controls with a gamepad are very tight, and while I don't know about how it plays with a mouse and keyboard, I really doubt anyone will be playing this with mouse and keyboard anyway. Controller wise it's quite excellent and you'll never have to feel as if half the difficulty is the controls themselves.Now for difficulty, they definitely went for a blend of Bloodborne and Dark Souls II, enemy placement is downright insidious. Enemies don't move slowly at all in this game, they're constantly leaping in and flurrying their attacks in combos, and enemies are not afraid to work together. I will say that unlike in previous games, there are enemies who can attack and kill each other while trying to kill you, so it's not QUITE as bad as previous games where enemies would shield block you while enemies behind them would combo you in groups of 3s. I'm not going to say that doesn't still happen, too, however. Poise only seems to matter when swinging your weapon, so unlike Dark Souls 1 where you could stand still and sip your estus casually while 5 hollows beat on you simultaneously in Havel's armor, in this game you won't get that much poise and you will need to keep moving and swinging. There's a lot of secrets to be found, a lot of world to explore, and a lot of sights to see.Boss design is nothing like Dark Souls, bosses are not slow and lumbering. I'd dare say that alot of the bosses and encounters in the game were designed with coop in mind, and some of the bosses even seemed as if they were designed to be done coop and only coop (which isn't to say you can't beat them solo). The first boss encounter seems like a real hail back to Old King Doran of Demon's Souls, and the second boss encounter is a lot more vicious than it first seems.Gone is power stancing but in its place they have introduced dual-wield weapons, such as twinblades, a broadsword with a parrying dagger, and any form of fist weapon seems to be a dual-wield weapon. There's plenty of build variety, and in the case of fire weapons they went back to a non-scaling form of weapon that does a significant amount of fire damage. All in all, I would say that the mechanics of the game are very interesting, and it was done this way as an obvious answer to the balance problems of power stancing (such as dual wielding two greatswords).This game is a solid 10, but sadly, if FromSoftware are true to their word, this is the end. Maybe they'll make an Armored Core series that plays something like Dark Souls? Jokes aside, I wonder what's next from such a great developer.",1
Positive,"It's almost perfect.FromSoft has learned from their mistakes, and has released this wonderful entry in the series that has fixed every main problem that the earlier titles had.At first, I kept preferring the first one, like many other people. But then, I had been enlightened. Absolutely gloriously amazing Co-Op and PVP experience. I adore the fact that you can play the game on your own, and when you're stuck on a boss, just call a friend or two over to help. Or the fact that you can bring your character from your solo experience into a multiplayer battleground of scummy tactics and dank memery. Fast and responsive controls, unlike DS1 Memorable boss battles Breathtaking scenery and widely interactive envoirments (Irithyll, Anor Londo, Lothric Castle.) Some great characters reminiscent of the first game's ones (Firekeeper, Greirat, Patches, Siegward, Anri.) References to older titles in the series (""Post-Apocalyptic"" Anor Londo, Siegmeyer's descendant, Solaire's armor.) No Steam Cloud support (Dafuq, FromSoft? Even DS1 had it.) Server issues Engine bugs Sometimes boring or dull envoirments (Cathedral of the Deep, Crucifixion Woods.) Mostly detached locations (with some exceptions), unlike the fully interconnected DS1.TL;DR: Improved on most of the other games' flaws, making up a great game Gameplay-wise, but missing on quite a bit of the first game's charm for the overall world structure and locations.Oh yeah, also, it's hard.Like, very hard.Not frustratingly hard!But very hard, indeed.",1
Positive,-created a character-killed some of the normal enemies-explored the starting area-was fascinated by the graphics-found corridor on the right-there was a cool looking lizard-lizard is tough as fuck-YOU DIED69/10 would try again,1
Positive,the best RPG game of all time better than skyrim,1
Positive,"One of the greatest RPG title that I've played, Dark Souls III concludes the Dark Souls Trilogy and ends the Soulsborne series as a whole, giving tight gameplay that truly fixes where Dark Souls I went wrong, and adds a new layer of Story and Interaction with the world. With consistently changing environments and a well-woven story, the game manages to give abstract and distinctly unique areas a cool feel of adventure while also making the world a believeably connected place, with little deviating from the core feeling. I would highly recommend to anyone looking for a great combat based RPG, and even a game to play through with buddies.",1
Positive,"All in all I feel DS3 is a good game. Just like the other Souls games it punishes you for making mistakes or being greedy with your attacks. The game has a couple downsides, but I'd give it an 8/10Pros:+PvE will destroy you if you aren't careful and the bosses and enemies are fun to fight+Still has a wide variety of weapons, armors, and spells to choose from+PvP is fun, though as always there are ""OP"" builds that are commonly used to win fights easily+There are hackers that hack to roleplay a character, or a boss fight which can be pretty fun to fightCons:-There are hackers, which means there are going to be times where you get invaded by enemies raining 1500 damage hell onto your head with no way to retaliate-If you have an unstable/slow connection (such as mine) you might not be able to participate in PvP much or at all-There's a glitch that happens very often if you have a poor connection where a friendly Phantom cannot enter through fog doors to help in boss fights (never noticed this happening to me in previous Souls games)-While the bosses are varied, I noticed that most of them are all humanoid(also many are some form of Knight), I want more terrifying monsters FROM!",1
Positive,Gud GameEdit: Deserves an award,1
Positive,good game if you want to punish yourself.,1
Positive,"The best Dark souls in my opinion. It makes sense that it was the last one. It rewards you for being good at the game and had a lot less of the cheapness of previous games. Not saying it didn't still have cheap moments but compared to previous versions there are less. The story overall is cooler as well in this one. There are more people to have contact with, more lore, more fun mechanics. Magic has a whole new element to it with MP. The combat is sped up. I like it alot. Nothing really felt new but it was refined.",1
Positive,What a fantastic game! Having beat all the Souls games (yes even Demon Souls and Bloodborne) on the Playstation I was excited to playthrough the game on the PC. Its been a blast thus far!10/10 would play again.,1

Positive,"Got gud, game got gudder, more gitting gud needed.",1
Positive,I just downloaded this game and my ssd took a poop.,1
Positive,"This is another great game in atruly great series. If you have played the previous ones I believe you will find this one easier and maybe like me feel that the world is not as big or deep as in the previous ones. On the other hand if you have not played any of the series before, you will definetly consider this a brutally hard, huge and very deep game.All in all it is a great game, much like the previous ones with a lot of replayability. I had a few issues getting it to play well on my decrepid old pc but with some tweaking of the settings I was able to enjoy it all the way, wiht only a fewmonr hicups here and there (with the exception of the last dlc where my frame rate - until the first boss - was so low that it crawled).If you are a fan of the series, you cant miss it. regardless if it is better or worse than the others, it is Dark Souls.If you havent played the rest I would strongly encourage you to start from the first one.",1
Positive,"Singleplayer, Co-op and the occasional Arena fight: 10/10An amazing experience, def. my favorite Dark Souls.The Shitty de-synced multiplayer full of cheaters: 0/10I don't know why they thought this was a good idea, but there's no permament bans in this game.If you cheat you just get a 1 or 2 week ban EVERY SINGLE TIME and all you need to do to get it lifted is delete your character.Basically a cheat fest. There are some fun cheaters to play with like that gigantic fucking Shrek dude that makes 2 people go against each other, sets both of their HP to 3500, disables Estus Flasks (Main Healing Item in the game) and sets both on fire so the matches aren't that long, but he's online rarely and just an exception.",1

Positive,One of the most amazing experiences that you can have in game. The atmosphere is great and the satisfaction from killing bosses is amazing. The game is epic as well as the DLCs will be. I highly recommend the game and THE HYPE FOR ASHES OF ARIANDEL IS REAL!,1
Positive,"I put this above Elden Ring, frankly-legitimately one of my favorite titles of all time. Whereas other Souls titles, reaching to include Elden Ring, suffer from pacing issues, this is a game that flows the entire way through-while ditching the moribund controls which sometimes hampered the first game and Demon's Souls.",1
Positive,"If you are someone who wanted to check out FromSoftware's back catalogue after playing Elden Ring, you will definitely vibe with this game. The game is more linear and the NPCs speak in a more cryptic manner, but the atmosphere and world building is done really well. The base game itself is also not that hard so the experience was not a frustrating one for me.",1
Positive,good game but if u suck like ethan dont play it,1
Positive,Best game series ever!,1
Positive,"You know you'll go straight ahead, even if you don't know the direction. You know you'd like to come back again and again, even if you can't touch the next campfire every time. You know that the darkness waiting for you is deep, but you'll raise your sword, right? After all, you are blessed by her full of hope. After all, the bonfire is still burning there,What about coming back, what about losing everything, what about meaninglessness? I just want to burn myself. I just want to point my sword forward. If your feelings meet setbacks, play with black soul; you will find that there is nothing unforgivable in the world, if there is, then play again.",1
Positive,"Where to start with this game. I love this series and consider the Souls/Borne games at the top of the Fantasy/Dark Fantasy genre. All three of the Dark Souls game are fantastic in their own right, but I feel this is the cleanest of the three. This game, being the last, is the most sentimental in my opinion. The DLCs are nothing to scoff at either. Sure, Ashes of Ariendel could ve had more, but I see it and the Ringed City as just one big DLC. The Ringed City though, delivers the best conclusion to the series that I could ask for. Don t even get me started on the music, the lack of it throughout makes the boss fights just that more awesome. Each boss is downright memorable due to this amazing soundtrack and gameplay. Combat is slow at first, but then it noticeably speeds up and every fight becomes more and more threatening. The community around the game is definitely something, but the online is typically entertaining. Replay value, there is so much you can do in this game and so many secrets to find, replaying this again is a pleasure, not a chore.This game is easiest of the three, but that doesn t make me think any less of it. If you re into a challenge and a good fantasy tale, try these games, you will not be sorry.",1

Positive,"This spot marks our grave. But you may rest here too, if you like.",1

Positive,"I DEFINITELY recommend this game. It is one of my favorite games of all time and is extremely fun. The combat is excellent in BOTH PvE and PvP. I only have 100 hours on this account but I have hundreds of hours on other accounts. I also recommend the dlc, which add a solid 10hrs (more, if you're new to the game) per playthrough and add a variety of new weapons, spells, and armor. Also, don't ever give up! It may take many tries to beat a boss or get through an area, but once you do, it's a very rewarding feeling. And don't be afraid to summon a random phantom or bring a few friends along!",1
Positive,"Thanks to the release of Elden Ring, an urge to try other FromSoftware's creations has awakened in me and then this game falls into my hands.The enviroment, music and voice acting is amazing, some people may say this game isn't completely new and original by instead having almost the same features of the previous games, but for me it was a great conclusion to the trilogy.The characters and vague lore are interesting and the levels and bosses design are impeccable. Classes are very different and appeal to every type of play-style. Combat is thankfully not hard not due to high HP & DMG opponents, but because of their moves. This allows people to actually learn and get better at the game, but without 'merely getting better' by getting better weapons and armor.I have not played such complete and satisfying game in a long time, Thank you FromSoftware for this masterpiece.PS: PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD PUT THIS AND THE OTHER GAMES ON SALE",1
Positive,"bought this game expecting a fun fantasy game for my graduation summer. wish i knew at the time what i had signed up for, because as soon as i played it i grew a mustache and a beard - a scar formed over my right eye, and my muscle mass increased by about 1000%. i was born a female. i regularly have flashbacks to the invasions i partook in, and the invasions staged against me: i have as many confirmed kills as a Navy Seal. irl i live near a bunch of farms, so i stole a scythe from a neighbor and tried to dance about the town killing people - i was arrested before i could go through with it all.out of five, i give this three stars; the reason for the minus two is because my breasts were really nice before this game changed me",1

Positive,"this game is the dark souls of graphics. they are good. Mak is quite good at this game, so i think it is really cool. KFC bucketThe bosses in the game, are rather graphical and have high poly count. The sword play is resolution. My video card enjoys this game and so does my son.",1
Positive,I fking love this series.*Deep Accursed haunts me till today*,1
Positive,servers are back the game is fun,1
Positive,"A worthy sequel of the Souls series. Mouse & Keyboard port is well done this time too. Loads of nostalgic references to the prequels. Maybe a little poorly optimized, but it does run good enough and does not crash atleast for me. Regarding to PvE there is nothing too noteworthy to complain about. I've been into some PvP for quite a while now and I've noticed that Poise as we know it is nonexistent. This means generally if you are not able to either outreach or outpace your opponent you are going to have a bad time. Thankfully heavier weapons have hyper armor but this makes heavy armor a mere fashion tool instead of it giving some actual functionality. All in all 8/10.",1

Positive,"The game is simply amazing.Best gameplay of the three entries.Best atmosphere of the three entries.Best soundtrack of the three entries.Best bosses of the three entries.Best weapons of all the three entries. (lotsa of comebacks as well)Coolest looking armor of all the three entries.Best summoning system (for jolly-fellas) to partake in all the three entries.That being said. The game ain't perfect. For instance, I'd really like to see a couple of things:-> More NPC interaction at Firelink Shrine. It would be much appreciated if they reacted more to the things the Unkindled One does. It takes too long for them to even bat an eye at the things you do.-> More NPC dialogs. For they repeat themselves way too much in this game, to the point of them sounding douchey or even seem that they've got Alzheimer.(I know the game has some bugs regarding NPCs, accidental triggers of appearances and whatnot, but that's minor imo).-> Maybe some 'Gestures' could trigger specific reactions from monsters/NPCs (not only the Firekeeper, thanks Bloodborne for that one). I lost count of how many times I used 'Call Over' to try to lure out enemies.-> Ice/Frost based Miracles/Sorceries. I We need them. (Maybe in future DLCs?)-> Darkmoon Blades / Blue Sentinels still suffer a great deal when leveling their covenant. Invaders have it way easier, as usual. In addition, it seems that the Blue Eye Orb no longer exists. I hope they bring it back.-> A graphical enhancement would be nice as well. The game looks gorgeous, but up close, you start to see its flaws and low texture, which are plentiful.Edit:-> NG+ Could be more similar to what they did on Dark Souls 2, the way it is right now could use some improvement (different enemies and perhaps different placement and so on).",1
Positive,"Dark Souls 3 is a great game (though not as good as Bloodborne), but avoid the multiplayer at all costs. There are many cheaters at this point in the games life cycle and most legitimate players have either left, or play offline like I have started doing. Additionally, 9 out of 10 phantoms you find in the early areas of the game are using equipment from later areas of the game or the DLC. This is accomplished by trading items with other players, and while it has restrictions on upgraded weapons, usually the late game weapons are in a power class of their own and make the early game trivial. This has always been the case with DS3, and while it was worse in DS1, multiplayer wasn't relied upon in the first game as much. As much as I love this game, checking the community hub discussions just reinforces the feeling that the community is zombified- pretty much all the threads are negative feedback about other players, or about players who have been banned for cheating.",1

I started playing the series on PS3 (demon souls) and i never finished it as I was still scrub at that time and had no idea WTF IS THIS GAME IS ALL ABOUT. I returned to the series with dark souls 2 and to be honest I liked it. Someone once told me Dark souls was superior so I borrowed the game and gave it a shot. and I liked both.Now we have the third and final game of the series, and gosh it is amazing. I was so excited for the game that it really pissed me off when certain people get to play 3 weeks earlier, and items location starts to pop up on the net. Trying to avoid spoilers as much as I could but well, internet is the internet. But at least there wasnt much spoilers after Abyss Watchers since there was an embargo. Which is nice.ish Still sucked that you couldnt play till 3 weeks later. Now to the actual gameplayIt plays wonderfully on my GTX 970. No random crashed. Combat is fun. I'd say its a combo between bloodborne style with dark souls 1. A lot of weapons to choose from. So all builds are viable builds. Except estoc. cause fck estoc. pffff ConsHackers. well we know this would happen on any PC game. Sigh. \I'd give this game a solid 9.5/10. I take 0.5 away cause there's 3 FUCKING POISON SWAMP AREA.

Positive,"Great game, beaten it three times on my Xbox and is well worth the 10 it currently costs. Though on my first playthrough I didn't like it that much and thought it was pointlessly challenging after you get through that first playthough you get to see just how far you have progressed and everything the game has taught you shows through how easy the once tough enemies now are. The use of new game+ lets you use your old weapons to beast through the beginning parts of the game with your improved loot. Or if you want to see how much your skill alone has come along, you can create a new character at soul level 1 to show off everything you have learnt and experience the challenge again.

Positive,"Cant help but to fall in love with every dark souls game that i play. Dark Souls 1 showed me the joy of a game not holding my hand and pointing me in the direction I need to go. Dark Souls 2 introduced me to invasions and PvP, playing with builds and trying crazy strats to defeat my opponents. Dark Souls 3 came with a more easy and linear approach to the series but not lacking in difficulty due to the new timing and wind up animation of bosses. The scaling of areas and breath taking views that you encounter will leave you in ahhh as you discover shortcuts, traps and mobs that will wreck you within minuets. The variety of bosses will keep your heart racing and wanting more. There are also a massive verity of builds that you can create for pvp and online play. As a fan of every Dark Souls, I must highly recommend this game for veterans and noobs of the series.",1

Positive,"So this is my second review post DLCs. I have to say that this game is really refined, and EXTREMELY good. Smooth & adddictive combat, a wide arsenal of weaponry, great landscape. However, even tho it does have the same feel as Dark Souls. I personal believe that the map layout is a bit sloppy, making you feel like you are just moving bonfire to bonfire. (TOO MANY BONFIRES) The map layout is not as looping and vertical as Dark Souls. But other than it hot having a better map layoutm itz a 9|10",1
Positive,"At the time of its release, Dark Souls 3 was a groundbreaking game. But in the year of our lord 2024, with both Elden Ring and Shadow of the Erdtree having released, is there any reason to play this game? Yes. Yes there is.If you played through Elden Ring and found the legacy dungeons to be the most compelling part of the game, then you'll probably like this, given that these previous Fromsoft titles are what the ""legacy"" is referring to. Paths that wind around until you unlock a shortcut back to a bonfire you were sitting at 10 minutes ago; amazing level-design; and challenging PvE in-between the bosses. The runs back to the bosses in this game are a little dire compared to Elden Ring, but there's nothing that's TOO bad, and the hardest bosses tend to have pretty forgiving run-backs. The Ash of War system in Elden Ring is in its infancy here, with a total lack of interchangability of skills between weapons. While this is disappointing in retrospect, one positive consequence of this is that every weapon has to be balanced to be at least somewhat viable on its own merits. Elden Ring and particularly its DLC has a glaring problem in that they are explicitly designed around encouraging you to change builds and use features like the spirit ash system if your build sucks at dealing with bosses. Why struggle to overcome Malenia for 200 attempts with your crystalian-themed build if you can just slap on Bloodhound's Step and use three statuses at once while your spirit summon flattens her with greatarrows? There's no reason NOT to use the most effective strategy because you have all the tools to make it at your disposal. In Dark Souls 3, however, the boss design is such that most every boss can be beaten by most every (reasonable) build and by a competent player, and being allowed to be creative is, I think, the strongest indication of good boss design in a game. Ashes of Ariandel and the Ringed City DLCs add some of the best content in the game. The former is accessible quite early, but is scaled to a much higher level; I would only enter when you're exploring Lothric Castle proper. The latter can be accessed either at the end of AoA or just before the final boss of base Dark Souls 3. The bosses are a comfortable middle between the anime 82-move combo lightshows of Elden Ring bosses and the slow, plodding knight duels of the previous games. They're epic and fair and I loved throwing attempt after attempt at them, feeling myself improve. Peak Dark Souls, in my opinion.",1
Positive,"Dark Souls 1 was effective but ugly as sin. Dark Souls 2 was gross in its entirety. Dark Souls 3 is clean, crisp and gorgeous to boot. It has the tight gameplay of the first, and none of the soul-lessness that the second suffers.",1

Positive,"This was my first soulsgame. After I got it I couldnt even beat the tutorial boss and stopped playing. Then a year later I came back to try again and after finishing my first playthrough with a friend I did a run on my own. Then due to reinstalling windows I lost my characters which hurt but I ended up starting from scratch, determined to 100% the game and I did. From not being able to beat tutorial boss to 100% achievements. Fromsoft games are special. Worth its price and an experience I wouldnt want to miss.",1

Positive,fun to play with other players,1
Positive,"Very welcoming for players wanting to try the Souls Series. The bosses in this game are very fun for the most part *cough* Midir *cough*. The game is tough at first, but once you adapt to the mechanics and the enemies patterns, you should have less trouble progressing. The only downside to the game I am seeing right now is the linearity and PvP. The game is linear, so there is less exploration than previous Souls games, but thats just my opinion. PvP though is full of A. hackers or B. Gankers. Of course, you can get good enough to beat Gankers, but the learning curve is steep. For hackers, download Blue Sentinel Mod so you are safer.",1
Positive,"Great game with great atmosphere that takes its difficulty seriously, but never in any unfair methods, making you feel that when you die, it was entirely your own fault, that you can learn from this and hopefully defeat the obstacle that killed you and feel all the more satisfied with the victory.Except the Multiplayer, that can go burn in hell for all I care. (Except the Sunbros, they cool)EDIT: On a side note, I actually wanted to say that the game actually personally felt much easier than I expected, for I heard people say this game ""is the hardest game ever"" and expected to be stuck on every boss for hours, but no, never went to double digits deaths on any of the bosses, even Nameless King.Not sure to chop this up to me having a lot of experience with games in general and having good reflexes, or other people just being really bad at this game and ""hyping"" up the difficulty. Enjoyed my time with the game regardless and appreciated the good method to difficulty this game employs.",1
Positive,"A great game for anyone with the patience to learn and play around it's mechanics. The entire point of DS is to provide a challenging but ultimately fair combat system while also letting players explore a dystopian fantasy world. It can be a daunting task at first and public perception doesn't exactly make the game look even remotely approachable, but I assure you that the game's difficulty is over-hyped. The game has several ""soft"" difficulty settings that can help you control how hard the experience will be. Don't get me wrong, it's still challenging but any pattern seeking human with a knack for using a controller can perform well enough to have a good time. Which leads me to my next point, use a controller. The game is designed for one and while it does have MnK integration, it doesn't work very well for this type of game. I use a wireless 360 controller with a cheap little knockoff wireless adapter I found on amazon years and years ago. Pretty much any controller you have will work well here (never used a steam controller myself though). Overall, a great buy.",1
Positive,Love this story.but so hard,1
Positive,"This game is really great. It reminds me a little bit of Bloodborne and Dark Souls 1, so if you're a fan of either of those games I think you'd like this one. This game is better than Dark Souls 1 in my opinion.",1

Positive,"i remember when i first bought and booted up the game, i was annoyed the keyboard controls were not mapped properly, or are just annoying when you dont know them, and how i almost refunded the game after it took me 2 1/2 hours and 45 tries to beat gundir (88 on pontiff on first run). now i have beaten it 7 times on nearly every class (all dlc) and i am currently doing a no damage boss run. 9.5/10, one of the few games i dont regret spending a cent on",1
Positive,"Oh boy, Where to start.We all know Dark Souls has a ""reputation"" of sorts. Be it good or bad, nearly everyone has heard something about it. From the hilarious/infuriating/epic PVP, To the rage inducing,. everything else. Overall: 8/10 * *Uses the Very Good! carving, and then praises the sun*Graphics: 7/10 Good but not cutting edge. Expect reused assets from previous From Software games.Gameplay: 9/10 Viceral, cut-throat combat, Addictive items collection mentality.Replayability: 6/10 New Game Plus (NG+) Is not what it was in previous games. But with multiple quest lines and endings, worth a replay for the truly devoted.Price to pay: Game: About 30-50$ (USD) Season Pass: Unknown, No DLC released at time of writing.Estimated time to finish: About 40-120 Hours for average/casual gamers.I finished the first playthrough of the game with almost exactly 81 hours on my first character at level 109. This being said, it was not a true 100% run, as I messed up many quests, And even restarted after a 41 hour character had made some royal mistakes that caused the entire game s progression to be unsatisfactory with my standards. There are 3 endings that i know of, and to get all 3 expect about 20-40 hours per playthrough after your first.Key Notes/Warnings:Be wary of Keyboard and Mouse. This game does much better than past installments of using these to play, but you will truly enjoy this game on a different level with a controller.Be prepared to use a guide for the game. The good gamers at darksouls3.wiki.fextralife.com have put an astoundingly well done wiki-togeather that has guides on every item of the game, from the mundane to the extrodinary. Online play is sometimes hard to connect to. (I suspect this will become better latter as the popularity fades.) Death Ahead! therefore, Try resignation. You Will Die. Alot. Be prepared to lose your souls over, and over, and be prepared to call for help from both guides and co-op players. But be wary, those you call to help may infact harm you by making your game appealing to those with a dark heart seeking to kill those who would so boldly try to kill the lords of cinder.Target gamer: Action-RPG Fans who don't mind using a controller. The game has everything most RPG fans crave, If you like RPGs, then this is a game that I suggest you try.The Short Version:Great game; With unique World, NPCs, Foes. Very Difficult for first time players, And thoroughly enjoyable as the rewards for every single action feel visceral, as if you can truly put yourself in the shoes of your character. The downsides are that this game is indeed so hard you will likely fail all of your NPC quest lines without some form of help, and even with help you may still fail due to some bugs creeping in.Pros:Good game length for money spent.Easy to use, hard to master combat styles. Decent sense of accomplishment and failure, Actions feel like they matter.Absolute tons of loot, weapons, gear, and thus a multitude of play styles.The Co-Op is rewarding and enjoyable, And the PVP is just as much so for the most part.Cons:Poorly Ported controls all but demand you have a controller. (Still the best souls yet in this regard)Buggy quest lines may cause characters with many, many, hours into their development to fail quests even if the user has done nothing wrong.Other Key Notes/Features:Unique Messaging system can leave you laughing, scratching your head, or simply shaking your head with a sigh.Unique take on Co-Op and PVP in an otherwise single-player focused world and game.Deep, but obscured lore. If you have the eye and mind for it, you can uncover an entire hidden world of strife.The Long Version: In the Dark Souls World there is no element more fleeting than the flame. Powerful beyond measure, and as fragile and fleeting as life in this world of the undead and horrors beyond reason. That being said, the game is as frustrating as it is rewarding. The rollercoaster of achievements, and failures is one you will have to ride at your own peril as one moment you're cursing at a boss made of bits and bytes of data, And the next, you are awe-stuck by your achievement of said boss demise at your hand, sending a very real dose of dopamine coursing through your veins as is the proverbial crack-like nature of this game. Immense, souls soaring(literally) highs, and deep, soul crushing(literally) lows.Dark Souls Is pretty, It is graphic, And above all else, it is a tale of tragedy, as if you look into the lore, you will find nothing but ruin, and pain. And so it mirrors this obscured misery unto it s players making them through fits of rage, and bouts of depression when they die, and eventually lose those hard earned souls. But let's stop for a moment and reflect; Is it really the game that is difficult, or is it really a case of knowledge being the key to all of your problems? Case and point, The first boss; I was having a hell of a time fighting it when i first started. And i ll admit, i was never the best souls player, but i enjoyed it enough that i kept at it. On my 12th attempt my friend made mention of a slight fact, that the boss mimicked the fighting style of a previous boss. Knowing the boss in question from Dark Souls 1, i put to use my new found information and on my 13th time at the boss, I managed to kill it without using a single health potion because I understood it now.This game does not hold your hand, And should you allow someone else to hold your hand, you will rob yourself of the true joy of this game, Which is discovering your own potential rather than riding on the research and insight of others. Die well my friend, your souls, shall not be wasted. ~Jes McDevlin: From the fight with Sif in Dark Souls 1+Rep if you know Sif s whole story and why he was one of the most tragic bosses in DS.",1

As we proceed to walk down the stairs, friend goes AFK, got invaded, the guy doesn't use any armor or weapons except for a shield.

Positive,This game is good you should try it with your friends awsome laggy pvp fights i love it,1
Positive,"I've only played a little bit, but it's every bit as fun as the previous installment (Which I owned on the PS3). As for the technical issues, either they have sorted them all out now or I've been very lucky as I played for 3 hours straight and never even experienced so much as a stutter on 4k resolution with a 980 ti and i5-4690k at max settings AA off. Very fun, very recommended, hopefully all tech issues have been sorted.EDIT: Don't know why this is getting ""downvoted"" or whatever; it seems like many people are having problems with this game, I was just stating in my experience that I have had none and the game is very enjoyable.EDIT 2: Apparently people are getting banned for no reason from online; I have not had this happen to me but I do find such action from the developers despicable, and if this problem persists or affects me I will not hesitate to change my review accordingly. I still love this game however, and I am usually not embered so that may explain how I have not been affected by cheaters messing with my save data.EDIT 3: So far I still have not seen the almighty and furious ban-hammer, however as mentioned I am rarely embered, making my online play quite limited compared to normal. This does not mean that I do not fear getting banned though, as it is now the main reason I kill myself after beating bosses (as to lose ember and not be connected to online). Again, I will rewrite all this if anything changes, but I'm sure I'd still recommend the game even for just its single player experience.",1

Funny thing is after beating Elden Ring and the dlc, Im given new ideas for builds in this game, and new ways to play this masterpiece. Heresy is not native to this world, It is but a contrivance, all things can be conjoined. Fear not the dark my friend, and let the feast begin.",1
Positive,"Dark Souls 3, huh? It's a game for those who like to suffer, just like Megatron's leadership. It's all about dying, dying, and more dying. If you're into feeling like a failure over and over again, then this game is perfect for you. And if you're worried about forgetting that you died, don't worry, the game will make sure to remind you every single time. It's like being stuck in a glitched loop, but with more swords and monsters. I give it 10/10 because it's the closest thing to being trapped in Megatron's lack of leadership.",1
Positive,I love suffering,1

Positive,"In shortPvE is really good, but way easier than Dark Souls 1, it's also way more linear.PvP is pretty interesting, sometimes you have a really good experience with smooth hitboxes, no latency, and just overall an enjoyable time with the game.And sometimes the experience can be compared to having fucking kidney stones, playing against a dude from the other side of the world with latency so high that he's just actually invincible or even completely invisible, and you start questioning how the developers didnt fucking fix that shit even after the game's been out for two years.But overall, it's still pretty fun nonetheless.>inb4 ""git gud""",1

Positive,"Like the predecessors of the Dark Souls series, it's a gloriously detailed and gorgeous dark fantasy universe.The singleplayer experience is hard, unforgiving. You are taught bare-bones basics of how to control your character, and then it's all up to yourself as the player to adapt and manage your own survival in a world where anything and anyone has the ability to kill you on the spot. But no matter how many times you fall, you'll never be granted death.Be a Knight, Sorcerer, Archer, or a deprived miscreant void of any respectable equipment and test your mettle in a world where both Environments, Monsters, Undead, Bosses aswell as other Players are determined to make you a mental masochist. This is a world of suffering, and you'll realize this sooner or later.Choose and make your OWN character. Choose your own weaponry. Make your own unique hero.Multiplayer can be misleading upon purchase. Multiplayer is intertwined into the singleplayer experience. There's no multiplayer lobbies, hubs, or anything of the sort. Aslong as you have internet connection, you will be able to spot messages upon the ground that other players before you has left behind, become invaded by hostile players but also be able to summon other players to help you in -your- struggles.Everything the game has to offer, must be explored and -found- in the game itself. There's no ""Press ESC and click on Multiplayer"" kind of deal. All forms of luxury must be fought for, and obtained.How immersive isn't that?Dark Souls as a whole, is a dark fantasy universe with dimensions colliding into one another. In the world of most fantasy hack & slash games your hero can usually withstand blows that could demolish a building and act unphased by it all. Only there's one major difference in Dark Souls in comparison to other fantasy games.your Hero, is only human. Go ahead, get struck by a giant.

Damn great. No mind-numbing hack'n'slash or self-lobotomising pew-pew.One sad thing is the compromise of gameplay for the sake of a controller. Dash and roll locked to the same button? BLEH.But who cares! This game actually stimulates brain activity instead of shriveling your grey matter up into an unusable mash.",1
Positive,"This is an absolutely AMAZING sequel to Dark Souls and Dark Souls too. I'll try to keep this brief and spoiler free though. The PvE and lore is done really well but on the other hand the PvP balancing and covenants are really poorly done. I feel like FromSoft really took a lot from Bloodborne and put it into this series which wasn't the best idea, the increased speed of PvP causes a lot of it to feel. bland.Overall if they can fix the balancing in the coming months and with the inevitably fantastic DLC that is going to come out I'll give this game a solid 9 right now. which is actually really low considering how much I like it but the balance issues can't be overlooked.",1

Positive,"A lot of games do yearly iterations of some sort, and usually people roll their eyes and growl angrily. Case in point: that new Call of Duty: Bioshock Infinite edition seems to have broken global hate records for some reason. While I'm not sure I agree 100% that yearly sequels are evil, I will say that I pay very little attention to them generally.From Software's Souls of the Week series is a strange little exception to that rule. I've wound up buying the PC versions of all their Souls-y games at some point, regardless of the fact that broadly, they're extremely similar games. I think they get away with it because the games themselves have no market equivalent. If you don't like Battlefield du Jour, there's a Rainbow Six or Call of Booker DeWitt for you. While obviously these games aren't the same, they hit the same broad strokes: military dudes shooting other military dudes in extremely contrived yet intense scenarios. I cannot think of a game like Dark Souls without having to seriously qualify the statement. I'm not aware of another series that apes survival horror, action-rpg, and adventure games so well.Dark Souls 3 is no exception to this.Basically, you've played DS3 already if you've ever played Dark Souls and Bloodborne around the same time. DS3 is the fastest entry in the core series. Enemies hit hard and often, and leave hilariously little room for error, even more so than DS1 and 2's more punishing fights. The combat, fortunately, is a little more forgiving than its predecessors. Dodge rolls work against attacks you won't believe, and frequently I found rolling into an attack somehow stopped it from working outright (I remember collision detection in DS1 stopping my rolly antics quite thoroughly).Dark Souls 3's map design is a bit lacking in my opinion. Namely, there's a lot less choice this time. I can't think of any real branching paths that stay branching for very long. Most of the time, you'll be exploring cathedrals and castles. The overall map variety might be the only thing Dark Souls 2 did better than its sister (better) games, and Dark Souls 3 doesn't have a lot to show for itself in this regard.That said, Dark Souls 3 shines in a few separate areas. It doesn't have the quirky-yet-haunting lore of DS1, but tells a reasonable tale in its own right. A particular, powerful motif is vulnerability. I built up a roster of friendly NPCs around the closest thing the game has to a home, and slowly watched them abandon me, or outright die, one by one. Generally, this happened because the game demands you care for and watch over them, something I failed to do many times. Solemn, powerful stuff.Dark Souls 3's greatest boon is its roster of bosses. There are 19 in the game, each one memorable in a way not even DS1 attained consistently. I might just be willing to argue that DS3's boss design has no equal in gaming. No, these aren't the hardest bosses in the series. But each fight offers firm stakes, be it a change in the timing of blows, disorienting arenas, strong ties to complex underlying lore, or simply great design. DS3's worst boss encounters would be the highlight of many other action-RPGs.There's not really much to say beyond this. It's a Souls game. Chances are, you know if you're bound to like it. It doesn't offer the raw invention of DS1, but it's more grounded and whole than DS2. If nothing else, it's a fantastic note to end the series on.",1
Positive,"Man, it s hard. To make up my mind on this game.Despite the general consensus, I feel like Dark Souls 3 is simultaneously the best and the worst of the trilogy. Let me explain why.It s best in so bloody many ways. It has the best controls. Arguably, the best multiplayer. The best boss design. It s the most artistically consistent one of the three: the influence of Bloodborne is felt in every detail which makes Dark Souls 3 stand out even more amidst other dark fantasies that is the style becomes even more unsettling, even more bleak, even more subtly sickening. Miyazaki and his colleagues have fully realized their vision of this grim world: no more goofy enemies from the first game, now everything you meet will make you feel awe, or horror, or pity, or disgust or all of that at once.Dark Souls 3 also honed its trick-based game design to the absolute extreme. As anyone who ever played the series knows, the AI is not the strongest suit of FromSoftware projects instead they rely on setpiece encounters scattered around the world, often in the form of ambushes. Before, you could always expect the game to play some insidious trick on you. Well, now you don t even need to expect anything you know the game is playing dirty. All. The. Time. Every enemy that looks like easy prey has in fact plenty of support just out of sight. Every item that you see in the distance is bait and you will be attacked immediately after picking it up. Every other room you walk into has a few layers of enemy opposition many of those layers hidden. It s simply beautiful how absolutely b*tchy it all is, and it hugely incentivizes you to beat this game to a pulp like it s done to you on so many occasions. It s surprising to see how with this attitude bonfire and shortcut placement feels liberal compared to the previous games.It s worst in only one way and depending on what you want from games, it might be a completely irrelevant negligibility or a deal breaker. It s utterly, utterly secondary. Art can be proactive and reactive. That s why most movie sequels turn out to be bad: because they can t be brave anymore; to be good they have to operate inside the limits of the original piece of art while being proactive at the same time, subverting what was proactive in the first project. Dark Souls 3 is very reactive, and almost non-proactive at all even more so than part 2. The mythos of the first game feels so far removed and almost irrelevant, and yet ever present in forms of rather ham-handed fanservice here and there and everywhere. A few nods to the second game are made, but for the most part it s as if it never existed and its events never even mattered. It is obvious that while mechanically the series underwent a stunning evolution across the years, ideologically it exhausted itself at the first installment. Where the first game dealt with primordial forces and the second one with the heirs of those forces, here it s just a bunch of degenerates pointlessly scrambling at the end of the dying world in which every iteration of events has already played out multiple times. The secret ending might transform it, but who are we to say it s not another turn of the same wheel just on a different axis? Another thing. Not so bad and not so big of a deal, but nonetheless. That famous trademark Dark Souls level design? You ll get some of it, but you won t get a whole lot of it. Yes, the world is still interconnected, but not to the same degree as it used to be primarily, if in the first game you could argue that all the roads lead to Firelink Shrine (or to Majula village in 2), here it s disconnected from the world entirely! Plus, you can teleport from the start, and shortcuts are plenty and generous, which makes navigation rather trivial.All in all if you want to experience an extract of Dark Souls, look no further you ll have a ton of fun unraveling this insidious labyrinth of a world. If you are here because of how much you heard of the renowned Dark Souls mythos or level design, just go and play the first game.PSDark Souls 2, despite being considered the black sheep of the franchise, has those great gimmick locations, so that s also something to look out for if you just want a cool dark fantasy world to explore.",1
Positive,it's okay i guess,1
Positive,"Difficult to learn and master, punishing bosses, superb atmosphere. You WILL die, again, and again, and again, and again, but then something will happen, you'll find yourself getting closer and closer to defeating the boss, the health bar will get just a little bit lower the next time you face them, that's when you realise that you're getting better and predicting their moves as you dodge their deadly onslaughts, and then, you will finally achieve victory, and you'll exalt a long sigh of relief and joy as you rest your wary ashen body at the bonfire, but you don't let that joy consume you, because you know that the dangers ahead are more terrifying and deadly than the ones before. You, the unkindled ash will fight on until your sacred duty is fulfilled, for that is why the bell woke you from your slumber. Only you can decide the fate of this world. Only you can decide the fate of the fire. You, the Ashen one. This game is next to the witcher 3 as one of my favourite RPG's of all time. This game is not for the faint of heart, but if you're willing to be patient and learn you will experience one of the most rewarding games of this generation. Don't fear death, for it is the only way you will learn, embrace it and it will serve you well.May the flames guide thee.",1
Positive,"""Once, the Lord of Light banished Dark, and all that stemmed from humanity. And men assumed a fleeting form. These are the roots of our world. Men are props on the stage of life, and no matter how tender, how exquisite. A lie will remain a lie!""Dark Souls 3 is amazingly indescribable. This game made by Hidetaka Miyazaki is a masterpiece that will deeply amaze you with it's rich story and impressive soundtrack by Motoi Sakuraba. The story of the game is like a puzzle in which players have to put pieces together in order to understand the game. If for a moment you feel that the gameplay is difficult and unbearable for you, be sure that you have not deeply understood the game yet. The game became easy and enjoyable for you when you realize the main point of Dark Souls 3. If you still didn't play it, it's time to defeat the Dark. If you're already played and you became disappointed or Failed to beat the Dark, it's time to try again.",1
Positive,"great game, play before elden ring. Once you can jump you cant go back.",1
Positive,If you want to start with the Souls Series I suggest you do it here. Probably the easiest Souls game to get into and it's still a classic.,1
Positive,"Out all of the Souls games, this one is my favourite next to Bloodborne. But as always, like every game made by FromSoftware it had a lot of wasted potential.The game overall is enjoyable, the Level Design is nice, don't have much to say about it, except for Farron Keepand the Grand Archives. In my opinions those areas are just annoying to go through. The camera of course, it's still the same as the previous Souls games and it didn't improve at all and sometimes you just have this big object or even an enemy that's behind you while you're fighting another one that blocks your entire visual and you just have to spam the roll button and see if you got lucky on dodging the attack or not. And about rolling, just like Dark Souls 2, there are only 2 types of rolls: fast roll and heavy roll (technically there's also a third one where the equipment you're wearing it's just too heavy and you can't roll or run at all). And for some unknown reason the game doesn't allow you to ""Poise"" through attacks. What's Poise? Like the previous two games, if you did have an armor with high defense on you and let's say, an enemy with a dagger comes at you and attacks, you didn't stagger and you could still attack while being attacked, or just do something else, but of course you still did lose a bit of health. In this game you get staggered every single time, if an enemy comes you with the tiniest weapon in the game while you were wearing one of the heaviest armor and that enemy attacks, you still always get staggered, that's really annoying especially in the first areas.There's Hyper-Armor that is like Poise but not the same thing. You have to be in an animation where you're attacking, and there are some weapons/catalysts that have it as a weapon art. Obviously Hyper-Armor doesn't work with all the weapons present in the game.The combat system is the same as the previous Souls games that sometimes is frustrating just to kill something because you get staggered every single time over nothing. From what I've seen the only difference is the parry mechanic that they changed back on how it was like in Dark Souls 1 instead of sticking with Dark Souls 2 parry, the speed of said combat and the new Weapon Art mechanic that uses the FP Bar (Focus Points). The removal of spells usage and the introduction of FP changed the way how you cast spells: Instead of being able to use, say, 30 Soul Arrows has been removed and now you're stuck on having this Focus Points bar that you have to refill just like your health. Basically if you wanted to carry Soul Arrow and Great Soul Arrow together so you can lure enemies out by using the weaker one and lose only 1 usage on THAT spell and then switch to the stronger one which you didn't use yet has been removed.The same Focus Point bar also gets used by another mechanic that has been introduced into the game, Weapon Skills or (Weapon Arts). If you two hand a weapon and press the ""parry button"" instead of parrying or blocking, you can use it's weapon special attack. Every weapon has a different one and each time you use it, you consume a portion of your FP bar.The bosses are challenging and fun and their soundtrack is fantastic and they go well with their design and game's setting. Some do get annoying because of the game's camera (thoughest enemy in the game) and some could have been far more better if they didn't just stuck on having you do the same thing over and over until you kill it. Not gonna name which ones.One other thing that really annoys me is that the game doesn't reward build diversity and it has a strange tendency on following this rule : If it looks cool it is bad . damn I really wish miracle spells were as good as pyromanciesThe Online aspect is one of the worst things, it has been the same since Dark Souls 1. It has lots of problems, sometimes players just start surfing on the ground and any of the animations don't start, that happens most if they have a bad connection or they're summoning someone. The melee combat is a Roll the Dice game: You can still get hit if you did roll correctly, you have to predict the player's actions and you could still get hit even if you're far away.The backstabs finally have been fixed and now instead of being a cutscene, there's an animation that starts before the actual backstab takes place so you can dodge and doesn't teleport teleport you back. mostly.The game's locked at 60fps since the game's speed is tied to the FPS. And you cannot disable VSYNC. I have a love-hate relationship with this game but overall it is a good and despite it's flaws, it's still enjoyable I really reccomend it.If it is your first time playing it, I would advise against summoning other players that will help you through areas and bosses because then it will lose its charm, and also it will limit the places where you can go until the player you summoned leaves. I also heavily suggest on buying both DLCs (Ashes of Ariandel and Ringed City) that will add new areas, bosses and equipment. Unlike the previous games, getting in one of the two DLCs isn't that hard and I still suggest on playing them without summoning other players. buying them do not fix the game's camera problem and do not bring poise back :-(",1

Positive,"Dark Souls 3 is the sequel Dark Souls 1 deserved. Miles above 2 in every way, 3 is the perfect mixture of DS1 and some elements of Bloodborne. You ll find yourself having constant nostalgia with the call-backs to previous games; be it in weapons and armour sets, or returning characters and areas. And that is just one of the things that makes you want to keep playing this game for hours. The areas and amazingly fleshed out, and not to mention absolutely gorgeous. Animations are very fluid and reminiscent to DS1. Bosses in this game are amazingly well done, requiring more than the standard Roll out of the way > attack > Roll > Attack mentality, and are all accompanied by a brilliant soundtrack, as always. In my opinion it is a lot harder than 1, and I found myself getting beaten into the ground a lot during the first few hours, even with my past experience with the souls games. It took a while to get used to the somewhat clunky-ness of the game, at least for me, my character felt heavy and burdened, but that soon subsides once you get a head for the game. Unfortunately I have experienced heavy FPS drops, especially when entering new areas of the game, though they are somewhat infrequent and by all means do not deter from the overall gameplay, even if somewhat immersion breaking for the briefest of moments.If you re on the fence about the game, for whatever reason, I assure you it is worth every penny. There is a tonne of replayability, as there has always been with the Soul s games. So what are you waiting for? Go and engage in some Jolly Co-operation! Or go invade and pillage or whatever.",1

Positive,"Feels like lost home. Words can't describe.I've never encountered a game more polished than soulsborne games,I just wish that mp feature was simple. PvP and invaders are quite debatable,there's no matchmaking in this game which means for eg : A guy who has played this game for 3k hours or more can easily invade a guy who's played the game for only about 3 hours which obviously is far from fair. Guess there'll never be a plausible explaination for this other than ""GIT GUD"".But the cons in this game are far from noticeable in the end,because if YOU die then it's YOUR mistake,one can't just blame controls in this game,that's how polished game mechanics are (No I'm not talking about backstabs,that's still broken). It would be nice if we ever get official dedicated servers though. Easily one of my most favourite game \ [T] / (Could be also because I'm a huge berserk fan lol)",1
Positive,"Dark Souls 3 is, without a doubt, the best game ever made. It's not for the faint of heart, but the sense of satisfaction you get from finally ""Git Gud"" is unbeatable. It requires a certain level of determination, perseverance, and maybe even a little bit of grit to truly enjoy. The technical quality of this game is top-notch, with tight hit boxes, precise i-frame timings, and a risk-reward system for parry and reposte that is perfectly balanced. It took me until the Nameless King boss (close to the end of the game) to fully understand the lock on mechanic, but once I got the hang of it, it was a game changer.One of my personal favorite aspects of Dark Souls 3 was the abundance of unique and powerful weapons to choose from. The Dragonslayer Greataxe, in particular, was a joy to wield. It was a beast to swing, but oh so satisfying when I finally took down a tough enemy with it.And let's not forget about those mimic chests. Talk about a cruel trick. Just when you think you've found a nice, safe bonfire to rest at, BAM, you're being attack by a chest with teeth. But the true shining stars of this game are the bonfires. Oh, the sweet, sweet relief of finally seeing a bonfire after a long and grueling battle. It's like a warm hug from your favorite, non-mimic chest.As someone who was learning to use a controller for the first time while playing this game, I can attest to the fact that it was a challenge. But with a little bit of practice and a lot of determination, I was able to overcome it and truly enjoy all that Dark Souls 3 had to offer.In conclusion, Dark Souls 3 is a difficult, but ultimately rewarding game that I would highly recommend to anyone looking for a challenge. It's worth every single death and I give it a solid 10/10, because let's be real, dying just wouldn't be as fun without it.",1

Positive,"If you enjoyed this review,consider giving it a thumbs up!Must BuyFallen Guardians of the land, beasts of an unspeakable nature, and undead abominations await you in Lothric, where the massive adventure that is Dark Souls III takes place. You are one of the unkinded, awakened from your eternal slumber to link the fire and preserve the light from the coming age of darkness through sacrifice and toil, where all others have failed. The task ahead of you: to find the four Lords of Cinder, those who were mighty enough to link the eternal flame, and return them to their towering thrones, through the only way which they can understand: violence. These four lords reside in lairs woven throughout your adventures, in such breathtaking landscapes as massive regal throne room of the Twin Princes, or the chamber of the Abyss Watchers, filled with corpses of the fallen. In Dark Souls III if you see a location off in the background then chances are you ll be going there at some point during your quest. Not only do the locations get increasingly captivating as the game progresses, the enemies do as well, becoming more and more interesting and challenging as you near the end of your great journey. Exploring Lothric is a joy like no other, but what sets Dark Souls III out as a true gem among other such Role Playing Games is that not only will the world fill you with joy to explore, but in many cases will also fill you with terror.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1185401586In Dark Souls III you can count the amount of beings that don t want you dead on one hand, ensuring that your quest will not be as easy as you may have thought. Enemies in Dark Souls III can be likened to puzzle pieces, each with their own backstory and every single one of them connected. Dark Souls III not only builds an exemplary game, but an enthralling world behind it just as well, absolutely no easy feat. There is no main storyline you re following other than the quest to return the four lords of cinder to their thrones, instead Dark Souls opts to give even the most miniscule part of their world a backstory and a place in the universe as a whole. The best way that I can describe this is that Fromsoft seems to have designed every enemy in the game as if they were a boss, not in difficulty, but in the amount of work and story standing behind them. Dark Souls III has also managed a level of environmental design that few others have ever come near, rarely can a game balance the looks of an area, with how that area flows and connects with the rest of the game. Dark Souls III s areas are filled with nooks and crannies brimming with goodies to be snatched up and put to use, many of which are so secret you won t notice, or know how to get to them, on your first playthrough. The sheer amount of secret or hidden items and areas that Dark Souls III has is mind-boggling. Sets of armor which you have to do a hidden questline to obtain, zones and bosses that you can easily miss, all of these await throughout the perilous walks of Lothric. There s this indescribable feeling of both satisfaction and glee you get after noticing a secret alcove or nab that out of reach piece of armor that encourages even further exploration. A critical part of every environment, one often ignored or unnoticed, is how everything in it sounds. Dark Souls III has some exemplary sound effects that enhance both the gameplay and the whole experience both inside and outside of battle. Not only are the sound effects definitely worthy of high praise, the same can be said for the music. In the more sinister areas, the music helps build tension, while in frantic boss battles it helps to keep the adrenaline flowing and ends up as one of the most memorable parts of the fight. There aren t really a whole lot of games with a soundtrack so good I would pay money to have it, Hotline Miami and Payday 2 being notable examples, however I find myself adding Dark Souls III to that list as well. The soundtrack doesn t just make the fighting and the ambience better, it adds to the characters, the bosses, in ways that aren t tangible or really there. This sounds like I m insane, a charge to which I plead the fifth, but just hearing a bosses soundtrack you ll feel as if you know them, and in some cases you may even regret putting them down. Music is a part of many games, but in Dark Souls III, in Lothric, it s not a part of the game, it s a part of a living, breathing world.Now after all of that talking about the environments, music, and how Dark Souls III feels you may be wondering, isn t this a game? Shouldn t there be gameplay? There most definitely is. Dark Souls III has some of the most fluid combat I ve ever seen in a souls game, making it enjoyable to play, not just enjoyable to walk through. The combat hasn t changed much from previous souls games, with some notable exceptions, but that absolutely does not mean it s any easier to master, this is Dark Souls after all. A major change from the other souls games is that in Dark Souls III you now have a mana bar for casting pyromancies, spells, and miracles, forcing you to split your total estus flasks into health flasks and mana flasks. You choose how many estus flasks you want to be mana flasks and how many you want to be health flasks, so you aren t being forced to either use spells or hold on to useless estus. The biggest change though is the combat: combat in Dark Souls III takes heavy inspiration from Bloodborne and is significantly faster paced any other souls game. Dodging costs less stamina, the enemies are significantly more aggressive, and as a general rule everything seems to move much faster than previous games. This is a welcome change and makes the combat flow a lot better and just generally more fluid, helping to make the game seem more fair. There s also the PvP to consider, though I won t talk much about this because that just isn t my thing, so I didn t play much of it. Player versus player combat in Dark Souls III from what I can tell is just about the same as it s always been, however the cooperative experience has been massively improved. They got rid of the dysfunctional soul rating system from Dark Souls II, now you can be summoned just about anywhere and by just about anyone, though you can regulate this by creating a password that your partner needs to match in order to connect. With such options you now have the ability to actually control your co-op experience, rather than using the needlessly complex systems forced upon you in the previous game. That seems to be a big theme with Dark Souls III: controlling everything. You control your co-op experience, you control the battlefield with the new and improved combat, and you control the power to link the flame. All you have to do, is find it.Dark Souls III is a not just a game, but an experience that pulls you in like a mimic and won t ever let go.",1

Positive,"From took out 80% of the pvp elements the other games had and made everything unpunishable as well as cost no stamina. As long as these things remain true, and no special_tech emerges, nothing makes the PVP worth playing at any deep level. The franchise will die slowly and the players will move on.the princes are cute though",1
Positive,"Once again, a new Dark Souls game is more Dark Souls, and I recommend it purely on the basis of that. However, unlike Dark Souls 2, Dark Souls 3 is actually worth playing even if you're not already sick of Dark Souls 1. Sure, it's got some significant mechanical changes, and it continues a few developing trends in the series that I don't like, but it's just a really fun game that manages to recapture a lot of what's great about the first installment, instead of just lazily throwing out the same things that you liked about the first one with infinitely less rhyme or reason, like 2 did.A few tweaks have been made to the usual presentation of the games. There's even more of a fire theme than before this time around, and a lot of stuff has been renamed as a result. This doesn't really affect anything once you get acquainted with all the new names, but it does mean that your character now has an orange glow around the edges of their outfit when they're [Human], which looks really nice in the shiny new graphics. A lot of the enemy designs are also fucked-up and weird again, like in 1, as opposed to the endless parade of knights in various armors that 2 had. Finally, there are plenty of callbacks to the first two games, some good ( a ruined Anor Londo that verges on genuinely affecting ) and some completely forgettable (more giant rats in a sewer area that are weirdly easy to kill). In terms of gameplay, Dark Souls 3 remains pretty loyal to the previous games' core systems as one would expect but has a few significant changes. It gives you a lot of stuff right off the bat, like your storage box and the ability to sell things (a godsend). It also gives you teleports immediately, like Dark Souls 2, which I still think cheapens the game's sense of a cohesive world. Besides that and a few other things, though, the game is mainly running on Dark Souls 1's rules as opposed to 2's, which I greatly appreciate. Being [Hollowed] works the same, Estus Flasks are your only healing tool, you can actually get ahold of 100% Physical shields, and overall it just feels so much more like the former than the latter. The main thing that I appreciate it keeping from 2 is the fact that weapon durability resets at bonfires, which is only good because it basically makes that durability a non-issue.The other big thing that Dark Souls 3 keeps from 2 is its hatred of sedentary blocking, unfortunately. If you're a tank, like me, you're gonna have to adjust your playstyle a bit; enemy attacks are fast, frequent, and stamina-annihilating if you choose to block them with even a good shield. I had to adapt by trading out my customary halberd for just my starting sword, which was bizarrely good and felt like a much better match for the game's speed.None of this is to say that Dark Souls 3 is without traits of its own. There's a whole magic bar now, replacing spells with a set number of uses, which I guess is an improvement. There's a neat system of refilling it that makes you choose between magic and health Estus Flasks. Weapons also now have specific skills associated with them when you're dual-wielding that use magic bar; I never really used mine, but it's a neat idea. It does come up in one of the gimmickiest gimmick bosses I've ever seen; if you've played it, you probably know what I'm taking about immediately, but if you don't: grab the item on the throne. The game is also a lot more linear than even Dark Souls 2; I didn't care too much, but part of the magic of the first game was how it had a whole interconnecting world, that looped back and around and into itself and really gave the impression of a 3D space. I will say that the linearity half-justifies the instantly available teleports, as without shortcuts like 1's Valley of the Drakes you have to backtrack across half the game to get anywhere. Finally, the game is really big on OTGs all of a sudden, presumably to make you use its recovery roll more often. I don't like that change at all, since before you realize you can recovery roll stuff enemies just keep getting a bunch of free damage on you.I've done a fair bit of complaining about Dark Souls 3, but it is actually very fun. It's not a masterpiece like Dark Souls 1, but its adherence to that game's best parts make it really engaging and enjoyable most of the time, way more than 2. I wish it was a bit more like the first game in a lot of ways, but its differences don't drag it down too much, and in a few cases make it even better. If you like Dark Souls at all, then well, then you were probably already going to get this, but know that it is indeed what you're looking for.",1
Positive,half my playtime is the death screen 2: electric boogaloo,1
Positive,Didn't know I was a masochist until I started to play this game.,1
Positive,I can feel this game taking actual years off of my lifespan10/10,1

Positive,"Overall I ve enjoyed Dark Souls 3 a lot. The exploration and big dramatic boss fights remind me of something like Zelda Ocarina of Time but if they added the difficulty of Zelda 2 in there. It s a really cool world to explore with a vast variety of enemies, character builds and weapons to play around with giving the already pretty long game a ton of replayability. Other than the PVP multiplayer, bonfire placement and a few bugs it s a fine game and a great ending to the Dark Souls series. I m considering getting back into playing Bloodborne now as well since my attitude towards the Soulsborne games has changed for the better with Dark Souls 3. If you re looking for a varied, very challenging game then this is the right choice for you.For my full review check out the video here:",1
Positive,"It seems that the majority of reviews for this game include 'poor optimization', but I don't really think that's the case. If you're running on a GTX Free Range Egg your frames are going to be bad, that's not the devs fault, that's your fault. Buy any decent card and you wont have a problem. I also have not experienced any crashes, but other people have, so I don't really know what's going on with that.That being said, there are some problems I do have with the game, mainly a couple of bad bosses and strange glitches. - For insance, for a hour I had an issue where summons would only slide everywhere, never play any animations, even when they were an invader.- Summons randomly not being able to walk through fog gates to critical battles.- Two really annoying bosses, in which the entire fight consisted of 'hit these specific weak parts while adds attack'.The game has been out for a month, there shouldn't be problems like these.But, overall, this has to be the best game in the series.+ Massive amount of weapons, each haveing their own pros and cons.+ Loving looking game, really got that 'withered beauty' they were going for+ Interesting NPC quests, which actually give good rewards+ Some incredible bosses which were actually fun to fight+ Fast gameplay, much like bloodborne9/10 - Might change when they fix stuff.",1
Positive,"Nothing in this game is designed to be fair. It will punish you for failing, not dodging correctly or being to weak to block. If you going to PvP, expect a sharp learning curve and if you plan to invade other people.never pick a fair fight.",1
Positive,[Edited]Multi-player has returned. [Original]I purchased four copies for multiplier capabilities of the game that was advertised with online play and online coop. Multiplayer has been removed. They are not a defunct company so it raises the question of why steam allows them to de-feature a game after it is sold and sell new titles.,1
Positive,"Best souls game, better than Elden Ring",1
Positive,"This game is like anal,Hard and painful, but you'll get used to it. Highly recommended i've never had so much fun with friends :)",1
Positive,it was pretty good,1
Positive,This game gave me a reason to live,1
Positive,You died even in your dreams.XD,1
Positive,I recommend it if you enjoy hard to beat games but if you want a company that cherishes your every opinion on said game then this isn't for you because they shut down the servers for what seemed like 20 years just to raise sales of Elden Ring,1
Positive,"100% the game, I love it! Even the first DLC. I still get that feeling of greatness when finally defeating something. The only thing I can say, like the other souls games, is PvP is boring. Once and awhile you get something that isn't lagging and isn't just the same items.Other wise it is the same weapons, same gear and fighting the weird hit boxes. I would say PvP is more tedious/the same than fighting the damn NPC mobs in the area.",1
Positive,"Not only can you use passwords so you can legit play with your friends at all level, PRETTY FAST, but it has some of the best stuff of all of the games. Imagine dark souls 1 with bloodborne inspired level design. So many waifus, lots of good boss fights, and absolutely great for beginners while still being challenging for veterans. Easily some of the best dlc bosses in the entire series.",1
Positive,Great game. Best in the Souls series since Dark Souls.,1
Positive,Can see where Elden ring originated from.,1
Positive,The only way to find it bad is to compare it to the original Dark Souls.,1
Positive,"Far from flawless especially pvp wise. But not even close to being bad, amazing experience and worth every single cent of its price and dlcs, Ashes might be on the shorter side but still enjoyable regardless.",1
Positive,"Let me tell you something. There once was a man called chaggle and he played Bloodbourne. Then he said WOW this reminds me of Dark souls 3 and he shot himself. The end!?Well it is not the end because in HELL he met a guy called Sethasaurus and this ""Young boy"" said that he is the Devil and he dosen't like Chaggles. So Sethasaurus got a machete and was like ""You know what i do not like 3 pears"" and chopped Chaggle's head off.Now this is the end.?",1
Positive,"When I (Claymore, strength build) was in Farron Keep, I was invaded by one of Rosarisa's fingers, and I immediately killed them. I felt bad so I looked them up them on steam and found out they were a girl (23F, she's really hot ). So now we play Dark Souls III together, so the game's pretty good I guess.",1
Positive,"One of the best games out there. In my honest opinion this game changed the way I look at games its art style, music, backgrounds, characters, story telling all of these are top notch if you did not play Dark Souls you are missing a lot of quality experience. This game is truly a MASTERPIECE.Praise the sun my friends.And dont let the flame die. Dont let Dark Souls die.Edit: After many years I did notice the irony of my review and the game's message but I left it in just because it points out how much I love this game.",1
Positive,"As I am writing this review I would like to mention beforehand that I have not played Demon Souls, DS1 nor DS2. Before I bought DS3, I was rather sceptical about it- about wether I would even like it or not, and worrying that it might become a game I would end up disliking completely and never finish it. And in the beginning, I actually came close to that moment. To the moment, where I felt like I wanted to give up. To the moment, where I became tired of fighting the first boss over and over again, only to be stomped into the ground and die. Over and over again. Thankfully, I kept trying. After some practice, enough attempts and luck I was able to beat the first boss. From that point onwards I discovered the Firelink Shrine, the comfortable home-base, and all it's features. I started to like the game more and more. The level-design, the large variety of enemies and bosses, with a lot of them bearing new challenging tactics, movesets and combos, the architecture, the different environments you get to discover.and so on.As of now, while I am writing this review, I have over 200 hours in this game. I'm on NG+. Short summary:Positive:+Gameplay Tutorial+Design+Epic Fights+Interesting enemies and bosses+Interesting lore and backgrounds to discover+Lots of weapons and armor (and magic)+Higher difficulty than in most RPG's+Co-Op+PvPNegative:-Discovering/Completing all questlines can require more than one playthrough-Questlines and possible outcomes sometimes hard and nearly impossible to foresee-No endless load of quests like you might be used to after playing other RPG's",1
Positive,"So, after 49 hours of struggling through the entire game (including DLC), this has been a fucking amazing journey. For those who aren't familliar with DS3 and love the lore, then this review may contain a few spoilers here and there.Graphics are outstanding, not as good as the one's from Elden Ring, but in 2016 it was PEAK graphics design. Still good graphics, very beautiful and the shading is really well.Graphics 10/10Now we're getting to the weapons and all that, the weapons have had a special move since DS2 but this game not only adds new weapons with new specials, but almost EVERY WEAPON has it's own unique SPECIAL skill, say the Uchigatana, you can either go for a lunge attack or a COUNTER ATTACK, or the DUAL WIELDING weapons like Onikiri and Ubadachi (most favorite weapon in the game btw), have this cool epic Jump slash that stuns opponent's who don't have resistant armor and then beats them to the ground, there are other weapons i can also say but that would be a whole day so let's just come to the conclusionWeapon Variety : 10/10Story time, so remember the 4 lords from DS1? SURPISE THERE'S 4 MORE YOU GOTTA BEATappreantly the Lords of Cinders are the following :The abyss watchers, guys who fell to the abyss like their inspiration Artorias and now are locked in combat, killing eachother back to back.Aldrich, a priest that developed a habit of eating men, and then eating gods, and he ate gwyndolin and maybe Nito, idk the bottom part has the same cape effect as Nito had in DS1, which makes me think he also ate Nito, idk just my theory.Yhorm the Giant, a Giant who failed to protect a loved one and lost all hope, he then met the Descendant of Onion boi Siegmeyer, Siegward. Siegward made a promise that if Yhorm becomes insane and doesen't link the fire like he's supposed to, then Siegward should kill em.Prince Lothric, youngest child of Gwynevere and a guy that can't MOVE, he was born with a curse that he can't move and he was told by the scholar that linking fire = bad.You go through graveyard, to Kingdom, to Settlement, to Forest, to Swamp filled with those godamn giant crabs, to another swamp, to a Fortress filled with dead bodies of watchers and skeletons, to Anor Londo again, to a Dungeon that leads to the Capital of Anor Londo, to the Castle of the Kingdom which is heavily guarded, and to the final area in DS1. Quite a journey of areas isn't it?Story : 10/10Now for my favorite part of the review, The boss fights.Every boss is not easy and won't be beatable unless you have the skill to ADAPT to what they do, Gundyr the tutorial boss is a perfect adversary, letting you know that this game is NOWHERE AS HELL GONNA BE EASY FOR YOU, especially when DS3 is your first soulsborne that you play. Then comes a boss like VORDT OF THE BOREAL VALLEY, who also lets you know that you're in on a PAIN TRAIN. However every Boss also has their own weaknesses, like Vordt, despite his huge size and intimidating look, you can go under him and then he will either A. use a smash attack that you can easily dodge, or B. Jump away. Some bosses also have their nice SECOND PHASES and maybe even THIRD PHASES, which not only extends the boss fight, but also makes them fun and tension is rising more and more. Never underastimate any of the bosses, because they are made to constantly salt your Soup.Boss fight design : 11/10The Physics in this game have been TREMENDOUSLY UPGRADED, finally no more sliding off some random ledges like in DS1 shortly falling to your death.Physics 10/10The Estus flask animation has also been improved, in DS1 you couldn't move when using it and it lasted like 2 seconds and by the time you were done healing you already took damage, in DS2 you had to level adaptabillity in order for them to work better, now in this game, you can drink that to your heart's content while walking around, so for those who love to drink the hell of that fiery delicious lava drink, this game's for you.Flaw from DS1 and DS2 : IMPROVEDFinal boss talk time.we'll go through the 3 final bosses of the main game and DLC'sAKA soul of cinder, sister friede and Gael.Soul of Cinder is your final main game boss, the Incarnation of all Souls of lords of cinders past. This boss can switch to 4 variants, the Sword, Spear, Mage and Pyromancer. After his 1st phase, he switches to Gwyn's fighting style, and can also use Lightning spears now.Friede starts off with a normal unrestricted duel between you and her, she has a variety of attacks such as a slash going back to make an explosive ice path and a final Smash attack. In the 2nd phase you fight her and her father but no matter who you hurt, the boss bar goes down no matter what. After that phase you'd think it's over but for some stupid Anime Main Character plot bullshit she gets up and get's a 2nd scythe, boss is hard cuz of 3 phases that you have to endure.Finally Slave Knight Gael is possibly the best Boss fight in Dark souls Trilogy, starts off agresively with not so much in his moveset, but phase 2 adds ember to your soul and he has a variety of attacks that will make your jaw drop, and phase 3 has the best Score and it's a desperation phase, the tension rises by every tick of the boss battle.Final boss fight designs : 12/10Now to go for ONE FLAW that the game hasit has the shittiest beginning of any game, like literally at the beginning, the game was kinda slow paced and was kinda bland, and you will have to endure the bland crap until abyss watchers, at abyss watchers the game becomes so fucking good it's like a blessing. that's the only flaw i have with the game, it has a very weak beginning, that you won't feel too passioned to progress through the game, like i said this review is an opinion so i'll be more than happy to hear your's if you have one.Beginning of game : 3/10SummaryIs this game perfect? no but it's CLOSE to perfectionis this game bad? not at allis this game a Magnum opus? Elden ring would most likely be the Magnum opus as of now, but let's think back to 2016, yes, this game can be considered a Magnum Opus of Bandai and Fromsoft, way better than Dark souls 1, despite not having a good beginning for the game that the player can enjoy, while constantly hollowing your humanity IRL, it's still a very great challenge for those who want to tackle the hard games, while not as hard as Elden Ring, it is still, one of the hardest soulsborne's of all time. Dark souls III enchances everything Dark souls I and Dark souls II had and made it to the point of perfection. If there's ever going to be a DARK SOULS IV, which likely is never going to happen lol, i would still be honored to play it.Thank you for your time on reading this review, this was my review on one of the best games i have ever played.Always rememberPRAISE THE SUN",1

Positive,"It's a shame I haven't reviewed this game earlier, because it is one of my all time favorites. I played it through to 100% completion with my boyfriend and loved every minute of it! This game is responsible for some of my happiest memories and for that, the least I can do is give it my seal of approval. But seeing as that probably means very little to the people reading this, I'll list off some pros and cons:PROS:- Huge, expansive and mostly interconnected world that is easily one of the most beautiful From Software have created.- Fantastic, frantic, fast-paced combat that brings some much needed speed and flow to the franchise.- Easily the most balanced difficulty curve out of all three games, with a much more reasonable flow.- Super in-depth character leveling system which allows for virtually any build you can imagine.- Steller boss fights, home to some of the most stand-out in the whole series! I'd name names but I don't want to spoil.- The inclusion of the Weapon Arts and Focus Meter systems spice the gameplay up wonderfully.- While definitely connected to the other two Souls' games, this game still stands on its own perfectly.- Tonnes of replayability thanks to the myriad of hidden secrets, alternate routes, and different playstyles available.- From Software once again craft a beautifully, yet subtly realised world through the use of enviromental and written lore.- The DLC, when viewed as a singular peice, is some of the best From Software have ever made.CONS:- Veterans of the series may find the first few hours ""too easy"" for their tastes thanks to the adjusted difficulty curve.- Weapon and spell variety is somewhat lacking compared to previous Souls' entries.- The faster combat can occasionally devolve into dodge-spamming and estus-chugging fests.- Covenents system, while servicable, feels somewhat vestigial in this game and isn't as deep as previous games.- PvP meta is a little stale at this point, most players run very samey builds with little variety.- The PvP arena system, while appreciated, has very few incentives outside of testing your skill and playing around.- DLC1, Ashes of Ariendel, is slightly anemic when not expirenced alongside the much more fleshed out Ringed City DLC.Hope you enjoyed this review, and I hope you enjoy this game! It's a must-play for anybody who loves the Souls' series or is looking for really cool and well-polished RPG. In fact, if you're new to the Souls' series and are looking for an entry point, I'd probably reccomend you start with this game, as it has, in my opinion, the best new-player expirence of any Souls title. (Don't worry about it being the third game, you can really play them in any order and still get the full story.)10/10, My personal game of the year.",1
Positive,"Just really good, bonfire crash issue is annoying but easy to overcome and will be fixed. Game is amazing, level design is so satisfying and gives you a real sense of accomplishment when you get to a new bonfire or shortcut.

Positive,"""I can't tell whether it's killing me or making me stronger."" This is appropriate. But in all seriousness, I love the Souls franchise, and this is another fantastic entry.

Positive,"As promised here is my glowing review now that the servers are back online. Dark souls 3, one of the most heart palpitation inducing amazing time one can ever experience! If you want to know if you should buy the answer is 100% absolutely! If you are a fan of difficult yet fair and rewarding game play this is absolutely the game for you! This game will break you down to your core, and if your will is strong enough, rebuild you into a monster fit to claim the first flame as your own!People often complain that Dark Souls is too hard, yet that has not been my experience. The skills required to be proficient in this game are just different, and when you start seeing the fruits of your labor with your skills increasing is by far the best feeling a video game has ever given me. However, once you master PVE things settle down and you no longer get the same rushes you once got for defeating a boss you were stuck on for 3 hours. This is the fork in the road where you can either start doing challenge runs chasing that high, or you can dive headfirst into PVP.PVP - people are quick to complain PVP is too hard, or unfair. Let a souls pvp veteran tell you of my first days of pvp. I used to panic whenever I got invaded. I cowered behind summons and called my friends to come to my aid at the first sight of PVP. After mastering PVE though there was nothing left to do. PVP in this game is exactly like PVE in the sense you need to get your teeth kicked in a couple of times. Getting your teeth kicked in - not very fun. But killing an invader, or invading and winning a 1vx is the closest you will ever come to to regain the high of your first playthrough. PVP is dynamic, and fluid, Unlike PVE which is challenging, yet also static. Of course this was not possible for the first half of 2022, however with the servers restored I must personally thank Bandi Namco for not abandoning my beloved series.Dear reader, you may also fall into the trap of thinking Dark Souls has no story. The hell is up with all the npcs laughing? Where are the cutscenes after each boss with long monologues of exposition? Nay, you shall not get that here. The story of dark souls is told in item descriptions and scenery. After a few playthroughs you will notice things you haven't seen, like the night of Lothric being Red and Blue, why is this? Or perhaps who is this guy called ""Soul of Cinder"" and why is his music so sad? My advise for this is to play through once, go watch youtube lore videos for 10 hours, and then play again to experience things you missed before.",1

Positive,"Contrary to popular belief, this game is not hard. It simply has a steep learning curve and it takes a while to get used to the recipe. When you get a hang of things, it's a great game with respect to combat. There are so many ways to fight in this game, and you have the option of finding your personal style of combat (within limits, naturally). The role-playing capabilities, on the other hand, are mediocre as what you choose to do does not really impact the world within the game to a large extent. Without spoiling too much, the ending leaves much for you to interprete.The community is largely helpful and ready to assist you if you ever need help with something. Whether you need help fighting something within the game or need tips on how to progress in some questline, you're bound to find answers on the forums. You'll rarely be told to ""git gud"" unless you 'deserve it' (I'll leave that up to interpretation). Don't be afraid to reach out, and praise the sun!",1

Positive,"So you're thinking about buying this game, huh? Well, let me put this simply: Go the whole 9 yards. Get it, and the DLC too.This section is for those new to the series. If you've played a Souls game before, you should skip past this (unless you want some juicy insight). The Dark Souls series is based around action rpgs that take place in medieval fantasy lands, which have you embark on a quest for a mantle of extreme power and influence, which requires you to first become an immensely powerful being. You become more powerful both by leveling up your weapons via various forms of the upgrade material known as Titanite (and Dragon Scales!), and your character by leveling up via Souls, which is a currency that is used for just about everything. You will gain souls by either killing various enemies and/or using/bartering items you find along your journey. However, you will not automatically level up wherever you are; you will need to head back to a 'home base' of sorts, and speak to a lady who ""tends"" to it (unless you're playing Dark Souls 1, in which case it's at any bonfire). However, the catch is that if you drop your souls basically wherever you died (if you fell off of a cliff, it'll still be retrievable at the cliff); and if you are either human or 'embered' (which in this game it's the latter), you will lose this status as well, and need to use another item to gain this status once again. When you die, you will be returned to a checkpoint of sorts, known as a Bonfire. You light bonfires and rest at them in order to regain healing potions (of which you have a limited amount, that can both have the amount of HP healed increased via bringing a specific item to a certain kind of person/bonfire, or the amount of uses increased via either kindling bonfires for Dark Souls 1, or retrieving estus shards and bringing them to someone who can make use of them- such as Blacksmith Andre in Dark Souls 3) known as Estus (and also in Dark Souls 3, Ashen Estus), as well as replenish your current HP. Bonfires are immensely useful, as they not only serve as places of a brief respite, but also provide a place to fast travel to (save for Dark Souls 1, where you must get through half of the game to access this, and it only works on certain bonfires). They normally can't be rested at if enemies are too close, but also when other players are alive in your world, and/or when you are going into someone else's world. The aforementioned human/embered status allows for you to engage in about half of the online play (being able to be invaded, as well as and summon other friendly players), saving the rest for various items you will be able to procure throughout your journey- some being easier to obtain than others. While PvE (player vs. enemy) is nice in the series, PvP (player vs. player) is a high point for it. Try not to shy away from it much, because it's usually quite fun if you can manage to have a fair (or generally interesting) fight.This iteration of the Souls franchise is less like Dark Souls as we're used to, and more like Bloodborne; as you'll barely ever rely on a shield (unless you wish to die), and there's barely any only some semblance of poise. Though, to be fair, this is closer to what the head developer (Miyazaki) had in mind when he originally created the series (apparently).Even though Dark Souls 3 leaves all of us Souls vets vying for a simpler time, it has an undeniably addictive nature. For every time you might be discouraged, and/or wishing to quit, you will come to realize that both Bloodborne and Dark Souls 3 fill a niche of gaming that apparently can't be filled with other games. The fluidity of its combat is far greater than its predecessors, and although it may leave a bit to be desired (I still want ye olde poise!), it makes me realize that it creates an itch that I just can't seem to scratch no matter how hard I try to by playing other games. It's quite fair (for the most part), and an overall enjoyable experience- even if you're not having your hand held through the game. The PvE is, of course, somewhat repetitive if you've beaten the game before at least once or twice; but the PvP- that's where a lot of the excitement is. You just can't compare fighting AI to fighting against other players. As I mentioned before, it can be quite fair; however, be warned: minmaxing and twinking (getting the most bang for your buck out of a lower leveled character, and getting better gear from a better character to a worse one, respectively) are two aspects of the game that will heavily influence a majority of your time engaging in PvP. Some builds are far more powerful and effective against others, so be mindful of your playstyle and what kind of weapons/spells/miracles you use.I can only end this by saying I wish that there was more to it. Not more to learn, but content to play with. Not to say that this lacks replayability, or will age poorly- I have roughly 400 hours of playtime at the time of writing this, and I still feel like picking up my controller and playing it. It's immensely entertaining, and will no doubt be enjoyed for years to come. I only wish that there was more to do, or that the community could pick up where From Software left off, and create our own content to play- but it would be impossible to do so, with how the game is regulated. Though this may be the end of the Dark Souls series, Souls-Like games (such as Bloodborne) will hopefully be able to fill the Dark Souls-sized hole in my heart. I just hope that hole isn't a Dark Sigil.",1

Positive,"Dark Souls III as an entry in Soulsborne series, considering all of their past entries, I would conclude that this game showed (in my honest opinion) an amazing (best) visiual (outstanding bloodborne engine) and technical (optimized, 60fps) performance in the series. Atmosphere of the game still holds up very well, but not as fresh and having moments of repetition (considering the lore of Dark Souls it's somewhat understendable). Gameplay wise it feels faster, more dynamic. Variety of builds in this game is wide and complex, bosses are one of the best (Nameless King, Sister Friede and etc.) and some are quite poor (just a few). Glad to see this amazing conclusion to Dark Souls universe, a classic and shall we remember it with fond (sometimes harsh) memories.P.S. Thank You From Software for this amazing game and franchise. Let the sun shine upon those developers!",1
Positive,"enjoyable for the first few playthroughs, not very replayable!some spoilers aheadpros and conspros - some fun bosses (NOTE THE WORD SOME) - none of the weapons feel useless - weapon arts are cool - rolling is solid - until ng+ there's a steady difficulty curve with only a few hiccupscons - some really shit bosses - weapon arts aren't as viable and spamming r2 - ng+ is a huge letdown besides the rings - level design is poor in certain areas but excellent in others, inconsistent.dragonslayer armor, the dancer, aldrich, even lorian and lothric, are all fun bosses that i enjoy. the problems are with some big letdowns in certain bosses, such as treebro and skeletor. those bosses just aren't enjoyable due to difficulty problems. tree is way too hard of an optional boss to include that early on, players have just only beaten the first 2 bosses, which are pretty much cakewalks to any experienced player. but the tree has some very unpredictable attacks and hits VERY hard for an early boss. the inverse is true of king skeleton, this dumbo has nothing that can kill you besides his BS smoke attack. he's pretty much the game's ""halfway"" point, so having such an easy boss for halfway through the game is a big dissapointment.level design is another flaw. some parts of certain areas just feel empty, while some feel very busy. many are strung together by bonfires, which on paper sounds alright, follow the path and find a bonfire - alright good. the problem is that some are way too close together and others are miles apart, leaving a long, long walk from bonfire to bonfire. this could be fixed very easily, but isn't. some areas are empty, too many times I've fought out of my way because ""there's gotta be something over there"" and there just wasn't. players should be rewarded for exploration, and while certain areas do, many areas don't.there also isn't as much freedom and I would have liked. many great rings and items are locked away until almost the end of the game, when players won't even get to use them. this is not fun and leads to many runs being same-old same-old builds.the game does feel rewarding, though. when the game does decide to reward the player for exploring or defeating a boss is does so generously, and gives powerful rings, spells, or even a plethora of souls. it keeps you interested enough to play to the end of the game.if the issues listed don't seem as though they will bother you, i'd give it a try on sale. i don't think it's worth full asking price.",1

Underpriced Worth full price Wait for Sale Not recommended Complete waste of money Overall (?/10) 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 7.5 8 9 10Supplementary Notes: I wanted to give this game a higher overall note, but I just can't with the clunky movement, annoying story-telling(you get most of the lore by inspecting the items in the game or you could just look it up on the web, also, there are a lot of unanswered questions regarding the lore) and considering that if you want to do all the questlines, you either have to look it up on the internet or play the game over and over to figure it out yourself. Another annoying thing, for me, is that you can't get all the items without going in new game+.The weapon balance is a bit off. There are a lot of cool looking weapons with badass movesets, but not that great. One of the most OP weapon in the game is actually a starter weapon for the mercenary class.The camera in this game is pretty awful and you have the same button for running and rolling(you can't change this), so when you roll there is a little, almost unnoticeable delay, but can get you killed sometimes.The game has an action queue system. That means that almost every time you press an action button it waits its turn in the queue and you can't cancel the action if, for example, you want to roll in a middle of an attack sequence. This gets annoying if you make mistakes because if you attack a few times and then you suddenly want to roll, in order to avoid something, you are stuck in that attack sequence and the roll(or rolls) will happen after that sequence, even if you pressed the roll button a few seconds earlier. You have to think your attacks carefully and don't button mash if you don't want to die. On the good side, this game has one of the best soundtracks I've heard in a video game and some really beautiful landscapes. The maps are really distinct from one another with a good diversity of mobs and places to explore.If you don't care about being OP all the time, there is a big diversity in what builds you can have so it doesn't get boring so easily, even if you start the game over a few times. The game gives you a sense of accomplishment when you finally beat a boss that you were struggling with, but most of them, depending on your build, go down in just a few tries.Looking from every angle, the game is somewhat overrated, but certainly worth a play.",1

Positive,"Such a great game, Loved it. For myself its everything i like and wanted in a game, to start with as anyone should know Dark Souls is a hard game and this one is really difficult. Yes there are some easy bosses but me having not played this franchise before i got killed by most things even some of the weaker enemies but i kept playing and got better each attempt , i do love a challenge in Video Games. I also thought the Story was fantastic even though there isnt as many cutscenes in this game only before a boss, after and in certain points of the game, which for me is really good because it rewards you in a way for getting pass a certain boss that you have been stuck on for a while or a particular area. I'm so excited for the DLC to be released and what the next Dark Souls game will entail. Hard game but when you finally beat that boss thats been causing you trouble with so little health left you feel so good and get more excited for the next boss you will encounter in this remarkable, Action role-playing game.",1

I would recommend getting some friends to play this with too it enhances the fun in this game.,1
Positive,"One of the best game I ever played. You should done at least DS1 to fully enjoy DS3.For me it 's not so difficult as DS2, way more like DS1. A good balance of each qualities of those two.Fights are impressive and the difficulty is definitly here without being absurd, only punitive as intended.DLCs are really worth it. Outstanding lore and difficulty.I can only make two complains: - usual laggy multiplayer- NG+ are fairly easy, more than the first run. Except for the DLCs.",1
Positive,"Easily my GOTY for 2016, a masterclass in hardcore action-rpg. The graphic engine update really helped this game along, many many veterans of the series say this is too casual and not as good as the others but I disagree, it's different but still challenging.Dark souls 3 uses an upgraded combat system/engine from bloodborne, it's faster, more aggressive and more engaging. It doesn't have any of the ridiculous difficult crap from the first game but is still very challenging. There's an enourmous selection of weapons and spells on offer to help you trek through lothric and take down your foes. I adore the gothic castles and locations in the game. Melee, magic, ranged, so many ways to play through this game. The DLC is also fantastic and adds lots to the story. I hope some day we see more Dark Souls games, I feel I need it in my life :)",1

Positive,The best game <3 (After Dark Souls 1),1
Positive,"The difficulty level and style of gameplay of the Dark Souls series I feel has now become legendary, often leading to other games being referred to as souls-like; moreover, creating something of a sub-genre of its own.To start off, I would highly recommend this game to anyone who wants deep character customization, and replayability. Think back to your days in the early final fantasy games, you spend 100+ hours developing your character only to get to the end of the game with nothing left to do, and only one area that maybe presents a moderate challange. With features like new game +, and an entire world of people to co-op or battle with, you have a game that will always offer you something to do with that character you spent all that time creating. To add to its challenging and enjoyable combat style, you have the ability to mix and match an entire armoury of weapons, shields, and magic that allows for the creation of nearly any kind of character theme that a person could conjure up.While all three games offer you a lot of options for character creation, each I feel provides greater focus on certain gameplay styles. The first being an unrefined game that for me offered the most interesting world, and the second which offered the smoothest gameplay and various combat enhancements, while the third enhances combat in a number of ways that if I'm not mistaken are unique to only this installment of the series.-Weapon Arts were options for most weapons that enhanced the ability of ranged weaponry, two-handed, and weapon & shield style combat. They provided additional abilities that are unique to certain weapon types: such as a quick-shot or triple-shot with a bow, to the famous samurai iaido slash, or special parry animations, to charging attacks and fencing combos.-Paired Weapons are the replacement for the power-stancing option of Dark Souls II; however, it limits you to only those individual weapons, unlike the power-stance option which could combine your own selection of weaponry. Although one advantage of this is that the paired weapons recieve buffs on both of their pieces as they are considered a single weapon.-A belt bar was added to your (pause-type menu) which gave you five more items that were easy to get to quick.-The ability to quickly revert back to the first item on your ten slots of items made it nice for finding your extus flask instead of going through the entire list of items you had equipped.-Password Connection Option allowed you to connect with anyone, regardless of level.So all in all they did add some neat features to this game; however, the smoothness of Dark Souls II was lost on this installment, combat feels more clunky and less flowing. The loss of power-stancing makes duel-wielding only a good option if a paired weapon is used. So as I mentioned above about each game providing more benifits to different styles, I feel that this game provided a much better gameplay experience for the following styles:-Ranged Weaponry-Two-Handed-Weapon & Shield-Specialist Spellcaster",1
Positive,Greatest game of all time!,1
Positive,"Mechanically, it's everything I want from a Souls game. The combat is fast and satisfying, the weapon arts feel amazing. Unfortunately, a side effect of the speed is that magic and heavy weapons are near useless. Not to mention it runs fairly poorly. Trying to co-op can be a real nightmare, but that might be early release server issues. Hopefully, most of these things can be fixed in patches. It's a bit of a toss up whether your system will handle it at the moment. All these things considered, I do enjoy the game, and I do recommend it if you want a Souls game. I will update this if the glaring issues are fixed.",1
Positive,"So i guess I can say I've finally finished a Dark Souls game! Now granted I do have a little bit of experience seeing as I've completed Bloodborne, but tbh I found this to be a bit more of a challenge. The main reason I went on this journey through DS3 was because I can't play Elden Ring atm and figured ohh next best thing haha and I'm so glad that I did. This is easily one of the best rpgs I've played in years!Now I've attempted to play this game in the past on ps4 as well as Darksouls 1, but I could never get to far without becoming either bored from the weighty and slower feel of the combat compared to BB or just general frustration. This time though I decided to switch up my usual class builds in these kind of games and went for a pyro/melee hybrid and MY GOD WAS THAT FUN. Never really knew how fun the magic systems were in these games, because i usually just ignored them lol. Overall this is a really fun game that allows for a lot of build variety, and I can honestly see myself coming back to it for a very long time. Heck I'm already 6 bosses into newgame+ and doing all the side quests I missed the first time around!If you're a new player who is concerned about the difficulty let me just reassure you that while yes these games are pretty hard, they are in no way as impossible as some make them out to be. Having trouble in an area or with a boss? Go grind some souls and level up like any other rpg. You can be super over leveled if you want and also there are summons that sometimes can be a big help! I tried not to use any summons, but admittedly the demon prince was just too hard for me as a pyro. Ohh and my god is the DLC great here, very challenging but also they have the most interactive story bits in the game imo. I can now say I'm no longer a Dark Souls virgin haha. I don't really fully know what the story was about, I mean I have somewhat of an idea but it's definitely a game where having some prior souls knowledge will help you follow along otherwise just youtube it like I did. Just like BB the environments are breathtaking at times, everything looks like a sorta water colored painting. From software might just be the best at level design in the business too. All the bosses and their surrounding areas felt top notch, I really love how the levels interconnect with one another once you find secret passage ways, doors, etc. overall great game 9/10 not quite on the same level as Bloodborne imo but pretty damn close! Now I'm gonna try Darksouls Remastered as a pyro!",1
Positive,"TL DR: Dark Souls III is. good. Nothing amazing like the first game, and in my view it's better than the second, but it ends up being unremarkable. Its bosses are really good, but the combat often devolves into who can spam light attack faster to stagger the other one to death. I'd wait for a heavier sale for DLC, since the areas are pretty weak. Dark Souls III is the closing chapter of the series, and it shows thematically. The age of fire and gods is fading, and the game's world is an amalgama of completely different places. The player is unkindled ash, chosen to destroy the three Lords of Cinder and linking the fire to restart this age. The world does feel like it's ending and its fire fading: pretty much all locations in the game are very bleak and lack some colour (something I'm not completely a fan of), and there's a huge eclipse towards the end of the game to drive this ""end of the world"" point home. There's locations which would be far away in DS1, now very much close to each other (part of these being more decayed DS1 areas, and one from DS2 in the DLC.) Some locations also feel very much from PS4 exclusive Bloodborne, a From title released a year before this one. Hm.The Bloodborne influence shows in combat, where it's a lot faster here than previous DS games, and there's no poise to not make you stagger like a bitch in heavy armour except when you're attacking with huge weapons. I felt I'd be completely wrecked if I was playing the game with a slower weapon, as after switching my slow Uchigatana for a pair of Twinblades the game started to feel a lot easier, since I could now stagger everything to death just by having faster attack animations. I had some pyromancies but I ended up mostly using the Carthus Flame Sword to buff my weapon, and fire orbs for support. I'm not sure how balanced this game is on PvE at least. Not very well, I think.I enjoyed exploring DS3's areas, though. Most are fairly large and fairly open, though a bit linear. The whole game itself, however is a disappointment: You only have 2 instances where you can pick an area or another in the whole game, a far cry from DS1's nonlinearity. There's a bit of bullshit enemy spam like DS2, ESPECIALLY the DLCs where I just gave up and ran through a lot of content because it was ridiculous. Having replayed DS1 this summer along with first playthroughs of 2 and 3, I'd say the first game still feels way more fair in this regard. There's fast travel between bonfires but they've toned down the bonfire frequency from DS2 slightly. We're back to having some shortcuts back to bonfires in some areas, which is really great.Bosses are easily the most fun part of the game, maybe provided you play the game with melee and preferrably not too slow weaponry, and with rolling and not blocking with a shield. Even though more than half the bosses in the game are fast-moving humanoids I didn't really get sick of that. It lacked variety in that regard, sure, but these fights all felt challenging. However, some bosses had way too much damage, or ridiculous 5-hit combos that if you don't dodge at first mean certain death. The fair bosses, however, are some of the best the series has to offer.Speaking of the DLC specifically, Ashes of Ariandel is ridiculously short, so not very worth outside a heavy sale. Both DLCs have visually amazing areas, but are a bit too heavy on enemy spam bullshit for me. The bosses here, however are some of the best, and The Ringed City's final boss is a perfect final boss to the entire series.Overall I had fun with DS3, but I never felt it was something truly great. It might just be that I played the first game first and nothing will ever feel the same, but maybe it's just that From didn't live up to it in the sequels. I don't know, but I really ended up enjoying all three games, and I'd recommend all of them. If you're new to Dark Souls, start with the first game and prepare to die!",1
Positive,I cry a lot so it has to be good.,1
Positive,The best book i ever played.,1
Positive,Huh. it's a good game,1
Positive,"(Note: This is more of a comparison than review)I was extremely skeptical at first being a die hard fan of Demon's and the original Dark Souls. I even went as far as to return the game before hitting the 2hr mark since I found the control mechanic way too forgiving. I've come to expect a certain take on realism from souls games & my character hopping around like buggs bunny running away from elmer fudd w/ no end in site to my stam bar really put me off. Fortunately a work buddy threw up the cash so I could repurchase it because he wanted me to ""come around"". Well, I did, but not fully & no where near the experience I had with part one but if I'm comparing Dark Souls 3 on the same scale as every other rpg out their it comes in, easily, top 5 BUT.I never needed or wanted to compare the souls univers on the same scale as other rpg's because the draw for me was that it was in a class all it's own. This is, unfortunatly, not the case anymore but as it's still a completely brilliant game (just not another work of art) I can still recomend it without a second thought.Should you buy this game? YES!Should you expect the same level of vision as previous Miyazaki titles? definately not!If you've never played a souls game before then do yourself a favor and pick up the original Dark Souls. (Just don't forget dsfix!)- edited for spelling (hopefully) & content -",1
Positive,".So. 'ugh, ahh. I'm. I'm kinda carrying in grief (more on that later) inside of my belly one heck of a story revolving around the Souls franchise and in particular, If I may, this third and last installment, so I'm probably gonna be a. ahh. a little emotional and irrational on some of my thoughts please bare with me 'til the end (Onegaishimasu) just wanna put that in your head. So I've started my Dark Souls journey about three and a half years ago, but frankly I've known the series for years now, maybe even since the jovial-ing days of Demon's Souls which whooshed above my head for some really weird and not necessarily related reasons; the time for me to finally see what it's all about came around when the second game in the realm of Dark Souls launched I've played it, hated its guts, and wanted to smash every inanimate object that layed innocently at my desk out of sheer frustration, despair, and pain. ""Why these mechanics aren't handed down to me like every other action RPG I've played in the past?"", I mumbled angrily. ""Why should I run again all way back to the boss from the bonfire? what's going on with this really weird checkpoint system?"", I wondered as I got stomped again and again by mobs while screeching and crushing my ALT-F4 combo buttons to death. After a few hours of wonder and constant death, I've decided to let my grasp loose, and finally set myself free from this awkward misery. I was ready to give up on this eternal experience for the sake of. nothing, really boy, was I wrong. My salvation came a few years later; Discord launched, I've gathered myself around many new people I've never met before, some of them are. let's call them the worshipers of the Git Gud gods, and after a few talk sessions with these guys, some really good soundtracks that came straight from boss fights, and my shining desire to prove that I 'Gut Gud', I walked through Dark Souls 1 for the first time after years of aversion and hesitation; that was love in a first sight. Really, the saying ""catching a lightning in a bottle"" couldn't have phrased itself better than here things that couldn't have worked in other games in such fashion, the minimalistic story and the Tolkien-like vibes of the lore, the genius level design that spider-web its way from location to location, the terrifying yet beautiful land of Lordran (it really seems that From Software s concept artists and level designers have been motivated [from personal enthusiasm, corporate pressure, or both] to multiply the volume of detail by a huge degree from their collaboration with Japan Studio on Demon's Souls), the simple, yet unforgiving combat system it's all been crafted here to perfection against of all odds. Really, a true lightning in a bottle. Dark lightning in a bottle. .and that was, pretty much, the moment I was born as a long-standing fan of the franchise. The burning, forbidden relationship between us didn't stop there, as I got back to Demon's Souls, beat it thrice (and got to see where a lot of great designing points of Dark Souls 1 came from, like an early sketch for a dream project), got to Dark Souls 2, loved it, thought it was great despite a lot of the hate and confusion around it (now I think of it as a mash of Monster Hunter and Dark Souls [although it took me about two playthroughs to think that way]), then I swarmed into Bloodborne, which is, by the way, one of my personal GOAT's as of now, and then. at last, the time for Dark Souls 3 finally came. Uhh. the disappointment was immeasurable. Coming from Bloodborne and his great foothold, the leap-up from previous installments, or possibly the entire evolution of the franchise, didn't feel. you know, as vividly, or shall I say, noticeably, as I thought it would be. The faster-paced battles felt more intriguing and faster in Bloodborne, the level design felt lacking compared to Dark Souls 1, which the game heavily relies on unlike Dark Souls 2, and a lot of great mechanics from that game, strangely, didn't come aboard (like Bonfire Ascetics, the stances, and the faster growth in levels compared to the second game which led to the option to test and create many different builds on the same save) even the visual refinement didn't impress me all that much, as I've finished Bloodborne before, and his strikingly beautiful hand-crafted world drew all of my enthusiasm, and nothing was left for Dark Souls 3 in my caliber. It almost feels like I was, subconsciously, trying to compare the two all the time without really giving the game a fair chance, and in a fierce battle among bloody gladiators, only one wins and the winner for me was Bloodborne. .T-Then, then came all of the technical problems which relentlessly swallowed my interest in the game even further. Since I've suffered before from corrupted saves in Dark Souls 2 multiple times, which led me to backup my saves from that point forward without relying on Steam or From and their Cloud-Save system, I did the same for Dark Souls 3 opened a new character, played it, backed it up, then came back to play it some more, etc. After a week of maintaining this routine, I got banned. It seems like From Software isn't very fond of independency, and so, I ""moved"" to the cheaters server, and I had to live with this shameful decree quietly, because the support didn't really care for my problem all that much. And from that point forward, I'm telling ya, it was like living inside of a wasp nest; cheaters invaded my world nonstop, messed with my characters with their mods or whatever and got all of four of them corrupted in the process. So I literally had to play the first 9 hours~ or so five times in repeat in order to finish the bloody game, needless to say, with the most boring and uninspiring quick builds I could make, so even that got taken away from me. I always believed that my relationship with the franchise was outright abusive, but my experience with Dark Souls 3 was nothing short of FULL BLOWN STOCKHOLM. I finished it (really liked the Gael DLC actually, thought it was brilliant), but never bothered to come back for it again. I always wanted to give it another chance, like I did with Dark Souls 2 in the past, maybe to like it more in the process, and by that to bid farewell to this beauteous adventure, but I just couldn't bring myself to do so the experience was that harsh and frustrating for me. It wasn't until very recently, which I got mailed from From Software on a support ticket from years ago (lel), which then I got informed that my ban was unjustified and it was lifted; and here we are today. So at the end of the day, I think it's a good game, I really am; It brings a final closure (I even dare to say ""a final FANSERVICE"") to the franchise and ends it powerfully and immersively, it's just that my experience with it was so shockingly terrible that I had to take my step-back from it for a while. Maybe this time I'll learn to like it more, I'm currently playing it for the first time from my 'OG' account, and- wait, what is this strange feeling?. A-I . Do I finally enjoy playing this game? THE DAMNED DARKSIGN DOESN'T CORRUPT MY BODY AND SOUL ANYMORE!? I don't really know, but it's heck more than I had before, and I think that's a good thing. Probably.",1
Positive,"Amazing game. Thought I'd hate it because of how infamous the souls series is for punishing players and I expected rage inducing moments one after the other. I brought a friend with me because I much prefer co-op, and while co-op in this game is a little uncanny (The friend you wish to summon has to put his ""sign"" down in the same area as you) in contrast to stereotypical multiplayer games, it has birthed some of the most fun moments I've had in most of my gaming life.It becomes clear to the player early on as to why the souls series birthed an entire genre. The level, atmosphere and game-play design is simply amazing. To iterate this, I'll give an example. [Mild game play spoiler, no story spoilers. Talking about some game design. Skip paragraph if you wish to avoid this.] There is an area early on in the game where, as you come upon it, you are able to hear loud thumping footsteps as you approach a veranda. Below you, you see dozens and dozens of fallen knights, and a GIGANTIC knight holding a halberd circling a fountain. After you exhaust all your other paths in hope of finding an alternative, you realize you have to go past this area. The way the level design strikes dread into the player as you have to drop into this area taking some damage and feeling very vulnerable, as you are distracted by an item nearby, you grab it quickly before what you thought was a corpse strikes out at you. At this point, in my playthrough, I panicked a little bit and dodged backwards. Before I realized it, the thumping footsteps stopped and turned. It increased its pace and I knew it was barreling towards me. Slam! It's heavy halberd smashed into the ground as I narrowly dodge it, my jaw clenching immediately as I attempt to run away by all means possible. It doesn't even occur to me to attempt and fight such a gigantic monster. That, is how much of a rollercoaster Dark Souls 3 can be. Look at the level design I just described. Firstly, the player is taught to anticipate a strong foe with the use of sound and imagery. A large foe holding a huge halberd would intimidate anyone. The imagery of many fallen knights suggests this one knight fell them all. Then, requiring the player to drop down means that there is no easy way to escape. The player has to trudge forward. Lastly, the placement of an enemy next to an item which would likely spook a player, causing them to run into the large enemy is simply brilliant to me. On to a bullet-point breakdown:The good:+ Great combat. Game-play is solid and birthed a genre for a reason. + Adjustable difficulty. Not with an ""Easy/Medium/Hard"" menu, mind you. It's up to the player to decide the difficulty. Too hard? Call some friends in, use guides, farm more levels. + The game respects you. In turn, you must respect it. It doesn't hold your hand at all besides some basic controls. How you wish to approach the game is up to you. Dislike melee combat? You could always turn to a bow or magic. Don't think you can effectively fight anymore? You can always kite your opponents or simply run past them. + Amazing level design. Glad they added a teleport between checkpoints feature which was lacking in the first game(I only played DS1 and DS3), although the level design doesn't shine through as much, some levels still have it good. + Music is great.+ Voice acting feels very fitting to me. + Lore. Subjective, but I quite enjoy the lore. It has a huge air of mystery around it and the speculation is what makes it so fun. The atmosphere by extension is greatly fitting and enjoyable because of this. I typically dislike gloomy settings but DS3 makes it fine. OK:= PVP. I don't mean invasions, I mean PVP in general. It has it's fun moments but can be tedious at times. Especially invasions. Players who invade are either kinda new or veterans in my experience. I either dumpster them or get completely destroyed. I tried invading a few times but they quickly devolved into 3v1 or 4v2 nonsensical gank squads so far. So, some will like it, some won't. = Invasions as co-op players. Yea, I know, you are co-oping the game already, why complain? I guess some people would just like to co-op the game in peace and not get invaded. Wish there was an option to not be embered but still co-op with a friend. Sometimes I am just not in the mood to fight players and would rather just PvE with a friend, but am forced to do so. Just another facet of Dark Souls, I guess. Forces you to get good!= Co-op can be a bit of a hassle to figure out if you're completely new to the series. The game clearly was designed to be more of a single player option as some (if not most) enemies are trivialized with co-op play, but it still does depend on player skill. The bad:- THE MAIN BAD: HACKERS. Please protect yourself before you play this game. Get a mod like pvp watchdog or other things which vet players before allowing them to connect.- Some latency. As with all online games, things can get preeeeeetty weird when people are lagging out. When you get invaded by a lagger, you'll know what I mean. It's a minor flaw though I think. - Some enemy designs can be quite unintuitive or outright unfun to play against. Such as the Prison wardens in the dungeons and Flail-axe dragons in the archdragon peak. Verdict: Absolutely YES. Love it. Give it a try. Deluxe edition for maximum value, refund it under 2 hours if you dislike it. It really isn't as rage inducing as you expect it to be, be patient and don't approach it as you would other games (especially Monster Hunter World, it gave me some bad habits). Still bad? Try it with a buddy. Makes it much more fun.",1
Positive,"Easily one of the best games ever made, and a worthy successor to the first Dark Souls game. Some of the most exhilarating boss fights of the series. The level design isn't up to par with Dark Souls in my opinion, but still really well done, especially compared to DS2. Some of the earlier areas like High Wall of Lothric and Undead settlement are somewhat lackluster compared to some of the later areas in the game that are absolutely amazing (Irithyll of the Boreal Valley comes to mind). The lore is also as deep and rich as the first game, which is another thing DS2 lacked. Thanks FromSoftware, for another masterpiece.",1

Positive,"My first Souls game. I was quite hesitant purchasing this as at the time I only played a little bit of Dark Souls, and to be honest, I didn't really enjoy it. So I thought I'd probably drop this game after a couple of hours. But my God, this game blew me away. Easily now one of my favourite games of all time. The challenges in the game are hard, but they're fair. So you never really have 'this level/boss is impossible' feeling.It also rewards you with many weapons, armour, spells and much more. This adds massive replayablity to the game as you can experiment with different builds. Oh, and the use of multiplayer in this game is fantastic. Also for summoning, out of the other Souls games I've played (DS1 and BB) this has the best summoning and multiplayer system. Though one problem I have is a common trend among the Souls series. It's the lack of information that FromSoftware gives to the player. I admit that during my play throughs I'd still have to google what a certain item actually does. However, some people may like this curiosity so they explore different items by themselves. An enjoyable experience either way. TL;DR: Buy this game.",1

Positive,"After 5 years of trying, I finally beat ludex Gundry todayI called my parents because I couldn't stop crying. I didn't know what else to do because I was basically in hysterics. For YEARS I've been trying to play Dark Souls 3 because I have really bad gas at night and everyone says Dark Souls cures all of your ailments and files your taxes for you. Well, that's been put on hold for a while because I just couldn't seem to beat Gungry. Until now. I came back to DS3 and finally figured out that the right analog stick turns the camera! After a few hours, victory was mine.I'm speechless. I cannot seem to place my words. My tongue is numb. I can't feel my teeth. Dark Souls is a metaphor for life because it's hard but when you do it good, it feels good. I'd also like to thank my high school music teacher for always believing in me. I can't stop shaking.",1
Positive,"Did you play Dark Souls Prepare To Die? If you did like me, then you most likely were just as hyped to see Miyazaki return to the franchise for Dark Souls III. And if you see the result, you'll see that he's still got the touch. Dark Souls III is a singleplayer adventure only compareable to the first game. It isn't really a game, rather than an experience. Dark Souls challenged it's players to learn the game in and out and master it's mechanics to overcome the numerous obstacles in their way. Dark Souls III reminds the gaming public, that you don't have to have a story to keep the player engaged and invested in it's gameplay and lore. The numerous throwbacks to the first installment can get a bit tidious, but the experience of playing it for the first time will remind you (or introduce you to) what it means to be prepared to die.",1
Positive,Champion Gundyr is the best souls boss,1
Positive,"Originally, Dark Souls was an incredibly groundbreaking game. The balancing act between the immense difficulty and still having the game be enjoyable is something that few games have successfully pulled off, and Dark Souls 3 did a brilliant job of continuing that. The majority of the games bosses are very enjoyable and satisfying to fight, even multiple times, and even the earliest game enemies can still pose a threat to you at the end of the game, which makes the stakes feel much higher, and maintains a sense of tension in between boss fights, and ensures that the games never feels like nothing is happening. The games art style is as tasteful and fitting as the rest of the series, perfectly complementing the tone of the story, with a melancholy colour palette that feels mournful, but not dreary like some games with toned down colours can feel. The soundtrack to this game is absolutely sublime. I really cannot stress enough how good of a job Motoi Sakuraba did with this. Every single track is so good that you can easily listen to it independently of the game, and it adds tension and drama to every boss fight that is almost incomparable to other games of it s type. However, the only issue I have with this game is how FromSoftware handled the multiplayer. In Dark Souls 1, the multiplayer system was pretty awful. It only worked about half the time, and when it did work, it wasn t a particularly pleasant experience. Then, in Dark Souls 2, they more or less fixed all the issues multiplayer had in DS1. They fixed their servers so that the connection was actually playable, they changed the summoning system so that invasions were actually enjoyable for the invader and the person being invaded, and they allowed people to keep being summoned in an area, even after they had beaten the area boss. However, when they got to Dark Souls 3, for some reason they decided to remove the best feature of Dark Souls 2 s PVP, the ability to still be summoned even after beating the area boss. Now, once you've killed the boss in that part of the map, you can no longer be summoned to other players worlds from it. I have no idea why FromSoftware made the decision to revert that change, but they did, and so it stands as my only significant criticism of this otherwise pretty perfect game.",1
Positive,"After 154 hours and all achievements cleared, I think I have a pretty good idea of Dark Souls 3's worth.As a video game it's an 8/10, as a Soul game it's a 4/10. Even Dark Souls 2 was better and I didn't even liked it in the first place !I'll go into details of what's wrong with this game if you're willing to go through my following wall of text.Oh, and I'm not gonna talk about the various crashes and wrong softbans that have plagued people since I've experienced none of both.Here's the biggest problem right away. It isn't Dark Souls, it's Bloodborne with a side of DKS. Don't get me wrong, I kinda liked Bloodborne but it's just a gimped DKS with more button mashing, little challenge and faster gameplay. Build variety, one of the strongest point of the Soul series, is nowhere to be seen in BB.So, when From Software decided to do DKS3, they probably looked upon their latest game that everybody was praising for inspirations. The DKS (including Demon Souls) series has always been about careful decision and slower combat that allow you ample time to understand what you're dealing with and how you should react, from here it was in your hands to deal with what come your way. Too careful was a terrible idea and recklessness was a sure way to a quick death.In DKS3, none of this matter. Hell, even getting ""gud"" is optional :- Instant Estus chuging plus you get a lot of them very soon in the game.- RB to death anything and anyone. - Dodge all day long.- Fast roll for everyone.- More invincibility frame than ever before.- +40% HP while being Enkindled.- Poise is gone but enemies don't have it too ! Mash that RB button !- Hyperamor is a terrible mechanism and can be abused with laughable ease.With all that on your side, believe you me, it's rather hard to die. So forget about the idea of challenge right away.And if it's really too hard for you, you can summon up to FOUR phantoms to handhold you, no need for easy mode or actually play the game ! People will willingly help you get rid of that pesky boss and of those nasty invaders. 4 VS 1 (or even 5 VS 1 if you use 911-DARKMOON) is a sure way to be completly rid of the only feature that's moderatly exciting.You will quickly realise that From Software got tired of hearing complains about the nasty red phantoms that invade poor innocent carebears to murder them for Souls and giggles. Mostly giggles though.Anyway, tired of hearing all this Miyazaki probably said : ""let's give everybody the finger and turn PVP into an horrible snoozefest !""I don't know about you, but I've loved PVP in previous instalment, both as the invader and the invaded. It added a unique thrill to the game, even more so when you've passed the 500h mark and can play it in your sleep.So what's in it for you if you like PVP ? Let's split that from the invader and host side.As an invader :- You get ganked. A lot. If you enjoyed DKS2 ""Gank Squad"" that might be your thing though.- Prepare to be spammed to death.- New meta PVP : bait the host and his (jolly) cohort to their death like never before.- Jolly coop-invasion (when available)- The grieving opportunities are both numerous and hilarious. (Giant crab will be your new best friend if you invade for Farron, for example)- Tedious stand of if neither side grab the bait.- [Phantom summoned] [Phantom summoned] [Phantom summoned] [Phantom summoned] [Phantom summoned]- Get rekt by SL100 and +10 weapon phantom summoned through password matchmaking while SL 15.- Seek for 20+ minutes the host who's playing hide and seek before alt-F4 when found.- Variation : host alt-F4 when defeated or running out of summons.As a host :- Never fear for your life if you summon non stop.- You can take a nap.- Twinking is basically out the window, so no need to fear any unpleasant surprise.- +40% HP.- Double the maximum Estus of the invader.- Free estus everytime your pets phantoms kill an invader.- 911-DARKMOON if all else fail.- If you're alone, you're probably in for an honourable duel if the invader isn't a dick.For both :- Equip straigth sword/Katana/rapier and mash RB for easy victory (works in PVE too !)- Dark Sword all day, everyday if you're really terrible at this.- LAG- HORRIBLE LAG- Protip : the more you lag, the easiest you win.- [fail to join session]- [unable to summon]- Protip 2 : A little amount of lag actually double your I-frame while rolling.All in all, PVP is either very enjoyable (little lag, decent opponent that actually knows what he's doing, etc) or an horrible pain (god awful lag, 4 VS 1 equiped with the above mentionned Dark Sword, final destination).SPAM RB.Unto next topic.Seriously though, apart from a certain secret boss that is quite challenging (especially for the camera in the first phase), PVE is pretty much a joke. Little challenge, gimmick bosses (by the way, some bosses can be stun locked to death), forgettable enemies, etc.Nothing to see here. Even more so if you've cleared Bloodborne.N.B. : One memorable thing : ""OCEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEIIIIIIIIIIIIIILOTTE !"" that was hilarious and felt utterly dumbBloodborne went through here for sure. Lothric high wall sure feels like Yharnam and the dark sun of the last part of the game, along with the final boss arena, remembered me of the fight against Gherman.Now put DKS and DKS2 into a blender with Bloodborne and, tada, you got DKS3. Simple as that. Nothing really new and even if the level design is way better than DKS2, it's still terribly dull and d j vu.My biggest beef though, in term of design, is against DKS3's music.DKS had a decent but forgettable OST.DKS2 had a boring one.Bloodborne had one of the best OST I've ever heard in a video game.DKS3's OST is just meh. Outside of the title theme and the one of Dancer, it's just displeasing and/or boring.BB had a really great music, it's not hard to see that probably most of BB's budget went into it. Plus, it brought back the fine art of telling a story all of it's own rather than just being a theme to a specific event (I'm thinking about the theme of Ebrietas and Ludwig among others).So when DKS3 hit the shelf I was prepared for a lot of downside but certainly not one on the musical level.When the title theme start playing for the first time I tought ""heh, that's nice. Good to hear that From learned for the best side of BB"" but then I heard the theme of Vordt of the boreal valley.And I had to turn down my speakers during P2. This bombastic choir and uninspired instrumental is horrible.Oh, I understand very well that it's made for the ""epic effect"" like some sort of wannabe Two Steps from Hell, but the fight is not epic (it's dull) and the boss is just dumb. Bombastic vocals while litterally spamming RB on the boss' ass is a lot of thing, but certainly not epic.Bloodborne did (let's call it ""empty epic"", it fits a theme but it's here to give a rythm or to support an atmosphere to a fight more than anything else) it much much better. See ""Living Failures"", ""Cleric Beast"" and ""The Hunter"".I know I'm terribly partial on the subject of music, but BB certainly set a higher standard than all previous From games Only exception might be Metal Wolf Chaos, make the office of the president of the United States great again and I sure wanted something of that caliber into DKS3 but, tough luck, all I got is this crappy OST ! Thanks From !Like I said before, DKS3 isn't a bad game. It's a decent game if you've only ever played BB or none of the previous Souls. It sure calls out to a broader audience than just the ""OMG so hard"" and ""Git gud"" audience of previous installments.",1

Positive,"The Game is a solid [8/10]:Must have to any fan in the series, Also I highly recommend the game to players looking for challenge:Story (7/10): - It's not your traditional story. not much is there Ashen one. - Also this game requires digging to find out the quest threads, I have finished NG and I did not do any quests yet.Gameplay (8/10): [Boss Fights] - I think that the Bosses of DS1/DS2 are much better than that in DS3. More variaty & interesting. - DS3 I did not feal that epicness of winning a boss battle. I think it's somewhat the easiest in the series. [Enemies] - In General: The world of Dark Souls enjoys some of the best enemies brought into Video games, the variety is great and the technices involved are also excellent on taking enemies. - I think that DS2 had the best variaety of enemies, with more unique approaches. - DS3, did not build on DS2 structure of approaching enemies especialy [SOTFS] version. - DS1 had these Black Nights scattered early and felt like a great challenge. the Metal Boar. DS2 had these big animal creatures and Knights as well. DS3 did not have much on that front. [NG+ and so on] - In General: DS games extend the replayability of the their games by allowing you to start New game Plus each time you finish the game. You can play differently, grow your character futher and even try different endings. this is a great feature from the Dark souls game that adds great value to the game. - Biggest dissapointment for me, just increased health / damage for enemies with added rings of +1. and so on. Sorry but DS2 SOTFS had a much more interesting NG+ with better changes. this is putting off. [World] - In general: the Wold of Dark Souls 3 is well crafted and at some points brings a dark Fantasy to life. - I think that DS1 Had the ultimate connectivity were most maps are interlinked. While DS3 still felt too broad. - DS2 had very interesting areas and despite the feeling of disconnect between. - DS3 is like a mixed bag between the 2, it did not really surpace the world of DS2 and not it's as connected as DS1. - Some times it felt that the area's are also just too big (e.g.: The Farron poisenous Swamp). - DS1 Assylem return remains the best hidden area in the series. - Secrets are scattered however nothing felt revolutioanry. [Death] - The challenge is in the death system, you must run to gain your unspent experience (Souls) gained before you die again or you loose it forever! it's awesome. - In general I prefered the hollowing in DS2 more than DS3/DS1. DS1 was too puniching with the humanity counter.[Multiplayer] - Best MP in a video game ever for me. I love the DS system. - You can summen people to help you and you can help others. - You could get invaded (part of the challenge). - You can join covenants to defend areas, attack people, or even to be summoned and defend other players when they are invaded. - The game's easy mode is it's co-up modes. - Other things make this game alife (and like with other DS games). you can see the ghosts of dead players, you can see the ghosts of players near you.Control (9.5/10) - This is still my favourate Action/RPG with solid & precise controls. - I did not play this with a keyboard & mouse as I only use KB/M for strategy / FPS. I enjoyed the game with an XBOXONE Controller. It feels natural with that. - Added Camera Control (8/10): - In general Camera Control can tend to be challenging especially when you are being cornered, however this is normal with this kind of games. - Overall it's still good.Graphics, Overall: (8.5/10): - Art Style: Dark Phatasy, a more crisp Dark Souls I style. - Optimization: I ran this game on my GTX 980 and it run perfectly on Max / 1080p - Atmosphere: Not as enhanting as DS1, however it's still good.Sound, Overall 6.5/10: - The game utilizes music at selected parts / areas. sometimes it gets too quit. - Boss Music fights is good though. There is a lot to say about this game, just enjoy it for yourself.",1

Positive,"It's alright.It has mods too.So here is my run down of how i think of the game and TLDR; if you care-The game is fun, really even if you consider it the weakest on the series, it is still far much more fun than a majority of games.PVP is a far cry to Dark souls 2 days, but fun anyway. What is wrong tho? Barely nobody plays it now days. Those who do, are either die hard fans, hackers trying new scripts or anyone who has a connection that can only be described from the moon.cool game.Best souls game to date for me.Experience all the other dark souls series and i can firmly recommend this piece of art.The punishing and extraordinary rewarding experience is still there, packed with familiar aspects from the beloved dark souls 1, it is just perfect.Dark souls 3 also has the most memorable fights and encounters ever and i genuinely say it as the best among games.Plus the graphics ain't half bad, if you are looking for those kind of games.

Positive,"Absolutely brilliant. The first Dark Souls has always been my favorite Souls game and I've been waiting for a worthy sequel ever since. While Dark Souls II is decent and Bloodborne is damn good, neither of them ever felt, to me, like a Dark Souls sequel, granted Bloodborne isn't supposed to be one. This game has all the atmosphere and feel of the original and it is great.Gameplay is incredible, there's a lot of different ways you can build your character and a lot of different ways to aproach combat. Tanking damage with heavy armor, high poise and a great shield; using light armor to dodge, rather than block enemies' attacks. There's also miracles, sorceries, pyromancies that can be used to buff your character, your weapons or to simply do damage. As for weapons: there's swords, greatswords, rapiers, axes, hammers, halberds, bows, crossbows, and I could keep going for a while. Basically, there's pretty much every type of weapon that you can think of and they all play in differently in every way you can think of. And all of these elements can be mixed and matched, resulting in dozens of different ways to play the game. Combat is very fun and addictive.The game looks beautiful; the environments look incredible; character designs look awesome, for enemies, NPCs and for the many different sets of armor and weapons you can use on your character. And it also is very well optimized and runs very smoothly. With everything maxed out on a GTX 970, i5 4690 3.5GHz and 16GB of RAM, the game ran on constant 60fps for over 95% of the time.As for story, the game continues the Souls trend of not giving you the story, instead making you discover it by reading item descriptions, paying close attention to NPC dialogues and speculating with the community, which is, in my opinion, a great way to present the game's story. The story in itself is also great.I've also been having a lot of fun with the multiplayer, a lot more than I did with the previous Souls games. Jolly Cooperation with fellow players is a ton of fun and dueling, which is something I never really enjoyed doing in the previous games, feels great. I feel like that has to do with the fact that there aren't any broken PvP builds, that make your character look incredibly stupid, yet other players won't stand a chance against them unless they're also using a similar build. Either that or those types of builds simply haven't been discovered yet, and I really hope it stays this way. I was able to kick ass in PvP using my normal PvE build, with a complete set of armor, an upgraded rapier and a target shield, without having to use any sort of cheese tactics to stand a chance, which is what always turned me off to PvP on this series. As in previous games, there's a pretty significant delay on PvP, and what that means is: basically what your opponent is doing on your screen isn't really what is happening, so sometimes they'll hit you and you'll hit them, blood will even come out sometimes, but no damage will be done. I don't personally find that to be a huge issue, it takes some getting used to, but once you do, you can have a lot of fun with PvP.The only 3 problems I have with this game are related to the NPCs. The first is that there seems to be a serious lack of dialogue from the NPCs, when you compare it to the orignal Dark Souls. I didn't take the numbers, but it feels like there's only about 1/3 of the ammount of dialogue that could be obtained from the original's NPCs in this game. The second problem I have is a problem I've had with the Souls series since it first began, and that is the fact that I hate how you have to clear the many areas of the game in a very specific order, to be able to finish the questlines of the NPCs. There's a lot of different areas and you can clear them in many different orders, and that gives you a lot of freedom to explore the game as you will, but all that freedom is completely taken away from you, if you want to complete the NPCs' questlines. And the third and final problem I have with the game are the NPCs themselves. There's not a lot of them and, honestly, half of them are just boring and don't have much to say in any way. Compared to all the awesome characters you met in the original, this is a big disappointment.Overall, I think it's a fantastic game. If you liked the previous games, particularly the first Dark Souls, you're going to love this one.EDIT: A lot of people are giving this game negative reviews because of the allegedly broken anti-cheat system. I must have played about 10 hours of PvP and I've had zero problems it so far. I haven't encountered any hackers, no items were placed on my inventory and I haven't been banned. Some people have also been giving me shit for giving this game a positive review and, well, I'm not going to give it a negative review on behalf of someone else's negative experience.",1
Positive,I have played all 3 Dark Souls and this one is my favorite. The combat is fluid and I always know what my enemies are capable of which means the challenge comes from reaction time instead of throwing things at you that you weren't expecting or can't do anything about. It's not easy compared to the other 2 but it is the most fair.,1
Positive,"If You are on PC, don't buy Dark Souls Remastered. Just Play this.",1
Positive,"Well. DS3 is actually really really great especially with the level design, combat, and ambiance. It's like you're playing Bloodborne but you're not in decrepit Gothic, Victorian era inspired city of Yharnam, instead you got medieval dark fantasy theme. The only thing i don't like from DS3 is the armor design. Just compare DS2 armor design with DS3, I bet 100% you'll prefer DS2 armor design. Like for example Faraam Armor when equipped in DS2 either your character is male or female, the armor suit perfectly with the character and look badass af, but when you equipped in DS3 you got this baggy loose armor oversize looking scooby-doo the freakin dumb ass character. AND. The appearance of moonlight greatsword from DS2 has been changed in DS3 from cool blue emerald to plain steel *i regret trade soul of oceiros with that wep, i should have trade with the spell instead* . Well if you're looking for Fashion Souls and not that Bloodborne type of gameplay just try DS2 or DS1 But overall the game is definitely worth to try especially for every hardcore RPG players",1

Positive,"it's good, you should try it",1
Positive,"Dark Souls 3 is (supposedly) the final installment in Dark Souls series.I honestly don't know what to start with, so lets just go 1 by 1, shall we?[GRAPHICS]Decent, fairly good PC required to play. The game's locked at 60 FPS. Probably the best graphics in the series so far.[GAMEPLAY]In DS3 developers returned to old formulas. DS3 plays a lot like DS1, but with some major changes.Fighting is slightly more fast-paced, probably inspired by PS exclusive ""Bloodborne"". Definetely the fastest and action-packed game in Dark Souls series, but not too much so its not like this is a new Devil May Cry or anything.Power progression is fairly good, there's a huge choice of weapons and armor to choose from that fit different playstyles. Although some weapons are clearly better or worse than the others, by either having some kind of exploit or being straight up underpowered in their respective class.Armor choice also doesn't matter as much as it probably should, so light-medium class armor sets are clear winners most of the time, and otherwise Fashion Souls is open to you no matter your build.Explanation why - below.[CONTROVERSIAL MECHANICS: POISE AND DEFENSE]Poise was reworked in DS3 and, in fact, was reworked again post-launch.In DS2, for example, poise was a straight passive stat that was dictating how many hits by what weapon you could withstand without being staggered.In DS3 poise is NOT passive, therefore anything will stagger you no matter what's your gear unless you meet certain requirements. It is also not THE poise, but instead a defense stat that PROTECTS your default poise that you have no matter what you wear (so you can poise through things even naked, provided you are being hit with a light, weak weapon).The requirement to activate the poise: you swing a weapon that has what we now call ""hyper-poise"" and the poise activates somewhere mid-swing. Those weapons are limited to: maces (two-handed only), greatswords (two-handed only), halberds (two-handed only) and all of the ultra-great weapons.Also certain special moves of certain light weapons have poise too (for example straight sword stance thrusting attack).Every of those weapons' classes have a class-unique poise multiplier. In other words: 30 poise with a Greataxe means a lot more than 30 poise with a Greatsword.Oh, btw, the reason why am i explaining all that is because the game doesn't tell any of that you, at all, ever. So i'm saving your time here by preventing you from going to google to understand what the hell is going on.[The Defense mechanics controversy]Your survivability in this game is linked to TWO separate defensive stats: DEFENSE and ABSORPTION.DEFENSE is a flat stat that calculates first. The game compares damage dealt to you with your DEFENSE and block a part of that damage based on how big (or small) the difference is.The formulas for this thing are INSANE. Comparisons go something like ""IF (damage > defense by 50%): deal 200% damage"". This is an example, but that is basically how it works. Its absolutely MENTAL.But you shouldn't care anyway because ALL the armor in the game gives the SAME amount of defense no matter what. The only way to get more DEFENSE is by leveling up. So there's that.ABSORIPTION is simplier, thankfully. It just mitigates damage by a percentage. So if you have 20% absorption against fire - you will take 20% less damage from fire attacks.Calculates AFTER the DEFENSE. So its not going to matter much anyway. Just a little clutch.And that's it for core gameplay mechanics that you should know, but you will not know unless you google them (or read this review).MOVING ON.[BOSSES]Probably the best in the series. Majority of them are very well designed and fun to fight against. There are a couple of worst ones too, however. Usually the ones relaying on some gimmicks that have nothign to do with actually fighting the boss.There's not as many of them as in DS2, but more than DS1 i believe.Regular enemies: give or take. Some are too easy, some are too hard. Depends, really. The game relies mostly on making the enemy harder than trying to overwhelm you with numbers (although there's still some of that time to time, so be ready).[DIFFICULTY]Harder than Dark Souls 1 (but more forgiving), but easier than Dark Souls 2 (mostly because it doesn't rely on BS gimmicks and ganks as much as DS2 did).Actual difficulty is somewhat low for first 25% of the game, then a big difficulty curve happens and suddenly you are knee deep in your own death and frustruation. And it mostly stays that way for the rest of the game (but can be compensated with leveling).New Game cycles: do not add anything major to the playthrough. The enemies become slightly stronger and you can find +1, +2 and +3 rings in later NG cycles (NG+ and NG++).The highest difficulty of the game is reached by reaching NG+7 where enemies reach their maximum damage output and health bars.[STORY / PLOT]A (somewhat) direct continutuation of DS1. DS2 is only refferenced through items and some characters. People are still debating whether DS2 is in the past or in the future.A lot of questions are left unanswered, so be ready for that. Otherwise - its not relevant to the gameplay, so you can just ignore everything. Knowing the plot of previous games is not required.[PvP & ONLINE PLAY IN GENERAL]Invasions are still a thing.Invaders' matchmaking prioritises games with cooperators present (NPC or not), making the majority of invasions putting invader into disadvantage, which concists of multiple factors including:- invader is most likely to be outnumbered (9/10 cases), and being outnumbered usually means death in Dark Souls games;- invader is most likely to invade host of higher level than he is;- host has a +30% health bonus (from being embered, which is required to cooperate / be invaded) and also has full estus (healing) charges, while invader's are halved.TL:DR - Invading sucks, having friends rules and makes the game 50% easier. If you want true Dark Souls experience - play alone, unless some particular boss gives you a bad time (and there will be such bosses).Twinks are a thing, but they're not too strong and if anything they simply even the battle-field for themselves.[WARNING: HACKERS ALERT]Hacking in DS3 is fairly rare, but its a thing, and its a dangerous thing. The hacker can corrupt your save file (intentionally so) and get you banned from online play (but not offline play).IMPORTANT: Dark Souls 3 does NOT supports STEAM CLOUD. Saves are stored ON YOUR PC at hidden directory:C:\Users\UserName\AppData\Roaming\DarkSoulsIII\RandomNumbers\File.sl2Make back-up copies of your save-file as often as possible (prefferably after each session, you dont even need to close the game to do that) so that you could restore things back in case something game-breaking will happen.[DLC]Dark Souls III has two DLC addons: ""Ashes of Ariandel"" and ""Ringed City"" with latter being the direct continuation of the former (so its best to have both, but you CAN have them separately).DLCs add new areas, new enemies, new bosses (2 in AoA and 4 in RC) and new gear (obviously) some of which is very unique mechanic-wise and often very good at its' respective class.Having both DLCs is recommend to have the full and true Dark Souls III experience.Overall Score: 89/100The game is VERY good, but it definetely has its flaws at certain aspects that make lives of such nerds as i am very miserable, because only those who truly love this game truly know what's wrong with it. And there's plenty of that. What are those aspects - you can decide for yourself once you play it, if you so desire.",1

Positive,"There's something about Dark Souls 1 that I think will never be lived up to, when it comes to world design, item placement, and lore through discovery.However, as a game that is effectively a love letter to its progenitor, there's a warm feeling of nostalgia while working through Dark Souls 3, a spark of excitement each time you get teh chance to say ""Hey, I remember that.""Mechanically, Dark souls 3 is best in show for me, with an excellent middleground between the original, and the most recent Miyazaki game, Bloodborne.Absolutely worth playing for every build, every item, and every boss fight.",1
Positive,"A solid game offering challenge for people new to SoulsBorne and good experience for each kind of player. With it's dark theme, beautiful soundtrack and polished fighting system, it makes a really good RPG that is worth your time.Controller is recommended, however you can still play on keyboard and mouse that aren't bad either.",1
Positive,"I used to have a negative review of this game up because of my issues with the poise mechanic. At the time, I believed there wasn't one in game. This was for a few reasons. Firstly, the fact that the system was completely overhauled from previous titles. Secondly, the fact that the system they did have was semi-broken. And thirdly, a lack of communication on FROM's part about these changes.For those that don't know, poise is a value in Souls that stops you from being staggered when hit, which can cancel you out of your attack animations.The game has been updated a lot since then, and the mechanics at play have been made more clear. The system for poise is extremely convoluted, and it's difficult to understand the math, but it works now. The gist of it is that you only get poise enabled while attacking. The frames it's enabled on are based on your weapon, and the value is based on a combination of your weapon, armor, and whether you've been hit recently.Having played more than a thousand hours of Dark Souls 1 PvP, I think I understand why they made this change. In Dark Souls 1, poise was active all the time, so you could equip some heavy armor, walk up to someone to bait them into an attack, and just walk through it without staggering as you circle around them to backstab before they can finish their attack animation. On tanky builds, this was absolutely worth it if you got someone to take the bait, but it was kind of cheesy.I do still have some issues with PvP though. The poise system in 3 has the problem of making every fight feel sort of the same. If you hit somebody with your first attack when they're not in their poise state, or even when they are with some of the more broken heavy weapons, often you just hit the same combination of buttons to do the true combo on your weapon that does the most damage. Imagine if you were locked into a cutscene where you do your fancy combo of hits on someone every time you successfully land a hit. It can feel like that sometimes, since the new poise system heavily encourages unbreakable combos and limits the gameplay variety.A more important issue is the covenant systems. Specifically the Blue Sentinels and Blades of the Darkmoon. In DaS1, the Blades of the Darkmoon allowed you to invade the worlds of guilty players as a blue spirit of vengence (usually against players who invade and kill) and punish them. It was a lot of fun, and gave an alternate twist on the invasion system. The space cops could come to YOUR world and hunt YOU down.In this game, the darkmoon blades are split into two covenants. The classic darkmoon blades, and the way of blue. However, both of them operate in the exact same way. You don't invade worlds of the guilty. Instead, you invade active invasions to defend the host against an invader. Not nearly as fun. When you get summoned, nine times out of ten, the host will only want to double-team the invader with you, so you either have to fight him in an unfair way, or let the host die. Neither of which is very satisfying. Don't get me wrong, I think this is a fine idea for a covenant. As a powerful red spirit, it can be fun to cut down blue ones one after another while making your way to the host. Blue sentinels do drop more valuable items than the host, so even if it lowers the chances of killing the host, you are incentivised to target the blues first. Additionally, you get some estus back for each kill, giving you some fuel to keep going if you play well enough. All of that can make for a fun experience. My only question is WHY in GODS NAME did the darkmoon blades need to be an exact carbon copy of this. It's so dissapointing, both from a darkmoon blade perspective, and from a finger of rosaria perspective. Gone are the days when invading had real consequences. Playing an invader in DaS1 and having the darkmoons track you down to your world and fight you on your turf was a great experience. You felt like a wanted man, and an absolute badass if you could fend them off. As a darkmoon, there's no way to punish the guilty in an honorable 1v1 situation, unless the host of the world permits, and even then, they don't lose anything. Not even an ember, like they would lose a humanity in DaS1. It's all safely contained in the invasion. I really wish these two covenants were split to offer both the DaS1 and DaS2 blue experiences, but instead, they've opted for two covenants accomplishing the latter with no noticable differences.With all that complaining out of the way, the game is really solid. I've had a lot of fun making varied and interesting builds, just like my experience with DaS1. If you're not interested in the PvP like me, and the majority of this review was a massive waste of time for you, I'm suprised you're still reading, but I still reccommend the game. The PvE content is just as solid, and would be worth it on its own. All in all, it's an excellent game, and it would be a shame if you didn't get a chance to play it.",1

Positive,"This review won't focus much on story since I don't care much of that in a souls game. I was gifted this game by a STEAM user, 1piecer. Shoutout to him, he's cool,Dark Souls 3 draws inspiration from all of its predecessors by borrowing heavily from Dark Souls, Dark Souls 2, Bloodborne and Demons Souls. I have played the first three of those game (never got farther than Father Gascogne), but I never played Demons Souls. The game has a lot of features from all those games but I can't say that I agree with all the features, areas and things borrowed from all those games.The game doesn't run very well on my Mac. I am currently running it at 720p on the absolute lowest with a lot of framerate drops. The graphics are quite good though, I would say I was genuinely impressed with how beautiful the world was and a lot of the details in it. Fire and a lot of effects look very good in the game. The boss and menu music in this game is phenomenal. I swear, its the only main souls game that I genuinely like the music in it. Very epic and gets you into the mood of fighting. The rest of the game is typical souls affair and doesn't have any real background music but I don't really mind.Dark Souls 3 plays very well and controls well. I primarily play with a controller for all the souls games, but for the short time I tried the mouse and keyboard controls, it wasn't bad. There are some new mechanics in the game that weren't there in past games like the ability to jump without rolling afterwards. Weapons arts is a new style of attack that depends on what type of weapon our character wields, they use focus points. Weapons arts seem to be more useful in PVP or one-on-one encounters with strong enemies. Dark Souls 3 also reverts back to a more traditional mana bar that lots of rpgs and Demons Souls had, than the use of charges for magic like Dark Souls 1 & 2 had. The game has a higher quantity of magic than in previous souls games but it seems like miracles, sorceries and hexes have been gimped while pyromancies have been improved. The former do far less damage than in both of DS3's predecessors.Dark Souls 3 favors a hub world with mostly independent levels like Dark Souls 2, and less like Dark Souls. Dark Souls 3's level design is constantly good and I would say that there is no outright bad level. I would say that after beating the game, my favorite levels were Cathedral of the deep, profaned capital, grand archives, Anor Londo and Lothric Castle. They had a lot more shortcuts than the other areas and didn't rely too much on bonfires. That's another thing from Dark Souls 2 that has bled into this game. While I like the fact that the hub world brings in all merchants to one area and allows for upgrading at one location and it also has it's own secrets and loot, I do not like the reemergence of leveling by using the firekeeper at the hub like Bloodborne & Dark Souls 2 and instead favored the use of leveling at a bonfire like Dark Souls.There is an abundance of bonfires in a lot of areas that could have done with more shortcuts. In general, the level design in DS3 is wide and less vertical unlike Dark Souls 1 and also unlike Dark Souls 1, you can fast travel from the beginning which follows in the steps of Dark Souls 2 and Bloodborne. This wideness makes a lot of the levels feel very large, which I liked but it cuts down on the amount of shortcuts in areas making me feel at times that certain areas like Undead settlement are generic. Most levels are not connected to each other like Dark Souls 1 either. Now, this isn't necessarily bad because I said that the moment-to-moment level design is good but I would have liked to see the series sort of return to the Dark Souls 1 level design in which a large amount of the main areas were connected to each other without the need of a bonfire. The areas I disliked were primarily Farron Keep. I am not a fan of the swamp areas in the souls series. I don't really like Blighttown or The Gulch. I really disliked that FROM still did not include a ring that allows the player to move at normal pace in the swamp. There is no real level that outright wowed me. In terms of linearity, some have claimed that DS3 is more linear than previous entries but I beg to differ. While it doesn't have the luxury of allowing the player to approach the same location from different entrances like Dark Souls 1, there are still enough optional locations for the player to get side-tracked off the mandatory locations and it is possible to reach late game areas from early on in the game. The level design of Souls 3 does get a lot better as I progressed throughout the game. Less bonfires littered all around and more use of shortcuts, and some areas use vertical level design properly.Souls 3 continues the tradition of having very good combat not only in the action or rpg genre but in gaming in general. It brings in some improvements the the existing formula but takes some rather large missteps. One of those missteps was the changing of poise to be pretty much non-existent like Bloodborne. This means that every weapon and every attack will stagger your character which is unlike Dark Souls 1 & 2. With the addition of faster combat than Dark Souls 1 & 2, this means that a large part of combat is either stun-locking your enemy to death or your character getting stunlocked till death. One or two particular bosses take this a bit too far with long combos and there a couple of enemies with long combos that don't give the player a rest which can get quite annoying. It is even worse in PVP with certain weapons that have good range and swing quickly. Another change that was influenced by bloodborne is the removal or armor upgrades and the increased use of rolling because of how little stamina rolling takes. I am not personally someone who plays the souls game in a very evasive manner. Bloodborne did it well being a new ip and having a more focused combat system, but I don't like it when Dark Souls 3 is encouraging and pushing me to play the game in a more evasive manner than when Dark Souls & Dark Souls 2. More additions from bloodborne are also the visceral attacks that can be done on certain bosses and enemies once they've either taken too much damage or their shield has been broken. It's done as a way of punishing people who overly block.New Game+ brings in new rings and new souls but isn't as robust as Souls 2. There are no new enemy placements, new boss-souls that bring new gear, or new red phantoms.The bosses are also sort of a mixed bag. A good amount of the early - mid game bosses are either gimmick bosses or are just easy. The game saves itself by having a lot of good bossfights later on. Most bosses this time have a 2nd stage that either changes the stage, or the bosses attack patterns completely courtesy of Bloodbornes influence. I like this addition of having a 2nd stage because it mixes things up in the fights. The downside is that it takes out the surprise from some fights that do have very good 2nd stages. I'd say that the bosses I enjoyed the most were lothric, dragonslayer armor, soul of cinder, nameless king, old demon king and maybe champion gundyr in that order.Covenants and NPCs don't stray away from what FROM has done in the past.Joining a covenant is now really convenient and only depends on getting a token from said covenant. Afterwards, all the player needs to do to switch covenants is to pick a different token in their inventory. It removes the ""betrayal"" system of Dark Souls and removes the need to fast travel back to a covenants area to rejoin.Co-op is nice and fast to summon to summon people but I have gotten into connection issues in the past couple of days. PvP is also a mixed bag. The push for a more evasive playstyle is there and everyone rolls around. Certain weapons are still there that stun lock the crap out of people and things like hit detection and ""phantom range"" are still very off in the game.will update after DLC",1

Positive,"I know my hours are very short on this version of Dark Souls 3 (I'm currently planning to finish the entire game on K+M) but I played multiple hours off the PS4 version & finished it too so I think I have a good grasp on explaining the game or at least an attempt at it.After 2 failed PC ports from Dark Souls: Prepare To Edition (RIP since Bamco decided to replace it with the god awful ""remaster"" that's basically a paid version of DSfix with bad lighting) & Dark Souls 2 (The Scholar edition has 60 FPS, good graphics and so on but the controls for both controller & K+M were wank), Fromsoft finally made proper K+M controls that requires no double clicking or weird key placements whatsoever.How is the final Souls game? Well for me personally I really enjoyed it and it returns the fast & fair gameplay that everyone loved about the original Dark Souls.While I'll miss a few minor features that Dark Souls 2 had (Bonfire aesthetics & very few UI item menu choices), overall it brings back mostly everything with a few new features like improved PvP for example.Majority of the bosses are really good (Very few bosses have questionable camera placements but other than that most of the bosses are really good), Lore & characters are better than the previous Dark Souls 2, enemies don't rely on horde spam to overwhelm you & whether you get the game on sale or not it's worth the price.I'll update this review whenever I refinish Dark Souls 3.",1

There is only one zone that is right out of bloodborne the rest is strictly souls. The game is optimized very well in my opinion although I'm sure you will find a review or two that say it crashes and runs like shit. I have had no problems what-so-ever running it 3440-1440 with g-sync enabled. It's also a pretty good looking game too! Their aren't a ton of graphical options to choose from but maxing them all out seems to get the job done. One thing I found nice about this entry is that starting a bon fire actually saves you there unlike the previous souls games where you would have to sit at one. This time around you get weapon arts which are a nice addition to the already great gameplay. From what I've seen so far each weapon has a different set of weapon arts, Or at least each ""Class"" of weapon does. Over all if your a fan of the series this is a must buy. I also have played this on PS4 and the game actually looks pretty good on console but where the two versions differ (PC) - (PS4) are the frames and the resolution.

Positive,I've played this about 2 hours now and I'm crying. I feel physical pain. This game isn't healthy,1
Positive,There's no need to see any reviews. It's Dark Souls. Buy it,1
Positive,"Now that I've 100%'d the game guess I'll say something about it.TL;DR: It's a good addition to the series, fun and interesting areas with decent challenge but if you played earlier Souls games it'll probably be pretty easy honestly, some mechanics don't work properly, pvp is pretty brainless because of it.Overall I enjoyed Dark Souls 3 a lot even if it had broken armor mechanics (I usually prefer a heavy build), I'm waiting on getting a better PC before I do more playing with different builds than the ones I've already chosen. I found the game INCREDIBLY easy the second time around, I think the mechanics just take time to get used to.Speaking of mechanics, major mechanics flat out don't work, example is poise, which literally is non existant since the last time I played (since release), making heavy armor builds nearly useless aside from some defences, which most enemies will do 1/2 of your health in a single hit anyways even with most armors unless you have high vigor, the only instances of ""poise"" are with heavy weapons where you're much harder to be interrupted when swinging making them still usable, I did a great axe playthrough and it was pretty fun.Enemies also don't really have any sort of poise (excluding LARGE enemies which can't be staggered or are very difficult to stagger) making weapon types like the straight swords incredibly strong with its fast swing speed, low stamina cost and decent damage when doing a 40/40 build, I LITERALLY STUNLOCKED HAVEL WITH THE BROADSWORD 1handed like seriously, they're insanely common in PvP along side katanas, I have like 300 hours of DS2 pvp experience so I mean, I'm at least a little experienced with Dark Souls pvp and I find it completely brain dead in this game for the most part, favoring R1 spam is usually the most effective way to win and weapon arts are mostly pretty pointless honestly. I can't really talk about magic as I haven't bothered using a mage or cleric build, i've heard faith is pretty lack luster, but iunno man.THAT ASIDE, the game is great looking and has a lot of good areas, I never found myself bored when travelling the lands, most of the bosses are pretty interesting (Although there's a lot of flame sword dudes, that's common) or complete shit, no inbetween. A lot of the bosses are just chaotic for the most part making them feel similar. The areas you travel are pretty interesting in general and are pretty well made with short cuts and bonfires, though they are kind of a straight line with maybe a split or two. Anyone that's a fan or Dark souls 1 will probably appreciate it a little more than they did Dark souls 2 map layout.That said play style wise it feels like a hybrid of Dark souls and Bloodborne with faster paced combat, lack of poise and armor importance, valuing dodging over blocking and the ability to easily combo enemies. Oh right, blocking is almost pointless with most shields as you can only block usually around 2 or 3 hits before being drained completely of stamina even with high stability shields.Oh and fix covenants, darkmoon took forever to max out.",1

Positive,"There are well over a hundred good reviews for this game out there, on Steam and everywhere else- but I will say, if you want to get into the Souls series, THIS game is the perfect one to start at. Not to say the other games are worse, but this game definitely gets major points for being the most fluid of them all. Combat, weapon fighting styles, bosses and progression is all very streamlined, and the difficulty will gear you up for the previous games. The ONLY major complaint I have for this game that would be important for new players to know, pure-casting builds are not beginner friendly, and don't function well in the early game.",1
Positive,"So. Dark Souls 3 was my first Souls game to play. As someone who likes to sit back and relax and turn my brains of when playing games (and would even choose Easy in games when it's a possibility), this game pushed me FAR outside of my comfort zone. The first time I gave it a try, I tried and tried at the Wall of Lothric, but ended up ragequitting. A while later I tried again and thought ""hey, I can also just run past some enemies instead of fighting them EVERY single time"". With this, I was hooked. All I thought about when not playing was Dark Souls. The movement, almost feeling like dancing and the rhythm stuck with me every time I stopped playing for the day. I died, a lot, sometimes asked for some tips from friends, but after 199 deaths I finished the main game and DLC. The memory of playing this game will stick with me forever. I recently started DS2 because of it (after a short break to just let it all sink in), and plan on playing DS1 Remastered after that. Can recommend to everyone that likes a challenge, but also for people that don't; the feeling of achievement will be even greater.",1

Positive,"I was super hyped for this game, especially considering my favourite game of all time is Dark Souls. After seeing lots of the footage shown at events I was super excited to finally get to play it.As a veteran on the series and a huge fan, I can confirm that this is indeed a phenomenal game that tears the previous games apart mechanically and technically. The introduction of the mana bar, whilst I thought would make magic too overpowered, is balanced perfectly with the fact it splits off of Estus Flasks, so you have manage wisely.This is by far the best starting point for newcomers of the series, but don't expect a cakewalk. You've probably heard dozens of times the series is hard, it definitely is. I am a veteran and I still get brutally mauled every so often, there is constant punishing for those who don't adapt to the games mechanics.So if you just die constantly, how is the game fun? Well, there is no series out there that gives you a greater sense of achievement as this game does, eventually tackling down that boss that tore you a new one constantly is a gratifying and rewarding experience, and makes you feel like a superstar. If you ever get stuck, you can always summon friends or unknowns to come and aid you during your travels. Whilst this does ruin the sense of achievement by beating a boss yourself, it's still a great mechanic for those who just want to experience the game.The combat has been completely revitalised with new Weapon Arts, which give you more access to combos and buffs that has never been seen before, and it's a welcome change.The lore behind the series in general has always been incredible, but it ain't handed to you. You've got to search for the story, find the missing pieces and connect them. This is one of them games that doesn't hold you hand throughout the game. All it does it give you the basic tools and the controls, and off you go.Speaking of controls, my biggest gripe with the series in general has always been K&M controls, this game is clearly designed with a controller in mind, and honestly it functions just fine with one. If you ever feel like being competitive you can always do PvP duels against others online. This has always been a mechanic in the game that keeps players playing after years and years, the Dark Souls and Dark Souls 2 PvP community are still strong to this day, though I can admit this game has the best PvP yet, thanks to the weapon arts combos and how much easier it is to invade this time around.I haven't even talked about the soundtrack yet, the soundtrack in the other games are incredible, but this game has surpassed my expectations for the music. I didn't think it would be THIS good, it's that good that I play it constantly in earphones whilst doing work.Seeing as I am a huge fan, the final boss and the nostalgia I kept feeling in this game brought tears to my eyes, thanks to how well the game is presented and how it harkens back to the good old days, never have I seen a game present such emotion through the smallest things, and it hits die hard fans right where they live.Overall, this is THE definitive Dark Souls game, and one of the best RPG's ever made. Is it better than the other games? Well that's down to opinion. Personally it does everything better than every other game, though nostalgia could make Dark Souls top it for me, haven't fully decided. After the disappointment that was Dark Souls 2, Hidetaka Miyazaki had to come up with the real Dark Souls sequel, and he has delivered!10/10",1
Positive,"Dark souls 3 feels like the lovechild of Bloodborne and Ds1.It plays really well, doesn't at all feel like it was rushed and provides you with that familiar difficulty that applauds skill and battle memorization. Unlike SOTFS where they just took the lazy approach and thought difficulty was simply adding more mobs to fight at once, Dark Souls 3 presents new enemies much like the first release.Experience nostalgia without feeling like you're playing the same game again, the connection to the other games are brilliant and sometimes very subtle, but so rewarding to see. Everything about this game just feels like it was done so right.The use of heigh in Dark Souls 3 offers a new expereince that the other games just didn't have, making you feel like you're ontop of the world in some areas providing you with a view of almost the entire game.I could go on and on about why this game is well worth it so ill just say this: If you are hesitant at all about buying this due to your experience with SOTFS (may have been fun but just not what you expected) or even just unsure about the game itself then I highly recommend buying this game.Thanks FromSoftware for creating this amazing sequel.",1

Positive,"Alright let me start of by saying, this game is definitely ""one"" of my all time favorites ! As i entered the souls genre with Bloodborne, and had a lot of fun with that, i knew i had to explore other From Software games, and let me tell you DS3 does not dissapoint! The game play on its own is really fun, and you can easily spend 100's of hours exploring new builds and experimenting around. DS3 has provided a tough challenge, but oh so satisfying when you beat the game! The graphics are really good, but the enemies and sexy bosses is what REALLY reels you in,XD. Prior to the game i wasnt into or rather i should say i was not aware of the lore, but i actually still really enjoyed the game! As of now im getting into the lore, and it really gives you that immersive experience. To know the lore of the lands around you, the bosses and enemies you slay! Now i will be moving onto the other souls games, in search of an even harder challenge, this time equipped with knowledge of both the games mechanics as well as lore! There is a PVP aspect to it, which also brings in a lot of hours, as that can get really addicting, especially with the Areana system. The invasion concept is also really cool and annoying at times, xd.Overall, great game, great mechanics,great lore, Two AMAZING DLC's, sexy bosses, and KINKY Weapons(with a really cool weapon art sytem). - 9.5/10 Only cons- Online bugs and issues",1

Tough at the beginning, but when your \""get good\"" mode kicks in the game becomes cake.",1
Positive,"Right. Dark Souls. I may be ever so slightly biased when it comes to this series, I have played every game in the SoulsBorne series apart from BloodBorne. For me this comes second best to the original DarkSouls. The only reason this still comes as second best is that the world is not as well designed as the first game; It still has the 'Hub' Area, but nothing links together in such an impressive way, Which is what, at it's core makes the first game so good. The combat, enemy design, Graphical prowess, and of course, The difficulty makes this game a must play. Whether you have played the previous games or not, you will enjoy this. Like everything its not for everyone, But I urge people to check it out if they haven't already. 9/10.",1

Positive,I still love this game,1
Positive,"This is the best Souls game. A die-hard fan of all the souls games and a very happy buyer of a PS4 solely for Bloodborne. This game hits all the right notes in gameplay, tone, music and nostalgia. It takes a lot from Bloodborne; most notably, the weapons all have something special to them. The weapon art system gives a third dimension to every weapon and creates differences between weapons of the same type. The unique weapons and boss weapon are also exceptionally unique.They've also included just about everything I wanted from Dark 1 and 2. A few minor items I would've loved and at least one boss throwback to DS2 would've been nice. Of course, DS2 isn't remarkable, it's simply great and I would've liked a reference to a boss I've killed dozens of times. But all that being said, the amount of time armor, weapons, locations and simply lore implications made me throw my hands up in the air is incredible. All the new stuff is great as well and harkens back to what makes Souls special in the first place.DS2 was easy, DS1 was difficult and I'd say this game is hard. Hard, but brought down to challenging because the best part about this game is how tight and convenient everything is. Things just work and little touches they added simply to speed things up are great. The obtuse nature is not gone, but refined to making it only frustrating on your own accord. Those little touches are great, but the big touches like how easy it is to co-op and put work into your covenants is fantastic.The game is just perfect and all I could ask for is more. It's a great length, but boy do I want more of this. Even if it doesnt amount to much, I just want more of a reasons to never stop playing this game. Now, adddressing the performance. For me, I have a beefy pc and it's okay. It's 99% of the time between 58-60fps but there have been strange instances where it would drop below, to even 24fps. But these instances occured only a few times in my 67 hours and not during crucial moments. Same goes for crashing; I crashed twice, but it only happened when I was literally just standing around for awhile.In a couple months, this game will run great, just like with the insane Bloodborne patch that improved performance greatly and lowered loading times from 45 seconds to 10. Do I recommend this? To a souls fan, I cant recommend it enough. To someone going in blind, you'll love it, you may miss out on a lot of references but the curiosity and fascination remains because its all just so interesting. Play 1 and 2, play Bloodborned if you can and then be ready for the grand finale! I know this is suppose to be the final Dark game, but please, say it aint so or provide DLC until I die!ps ADD AN ARENA",1
Positive,"This is like riding a bicycle, but the bycicle is on fire and the floor is on fire and you keep asking yourself why you are still doing this.So pretty much my high school experience, 9/10",1
Positive,"Great end to the trilogy. Perfectly challenging gameplay, deep hidden lore, fun enemies and level design. I recommend newcomers to play this before playing the first Dark Souls, because I think it will help to appreciate the first even more. The mechanics are more forgiving in this game (for example, freedom of movement in combat) as well as more clear and directed (the stuff that *shouldn't* be a mystery is not), and the quest lines are a bit easier to follow. When you are comfortable with the Dark Souls ""formula"" and understand the combat loop enough to not get burnt out, DS1 is easier to digest and enjoy.Also, don't compare the Souls games to each other. DS3 is just as good as DS1 in its own right. The game is more linear than DS1, and that's okay. The gameplay feels smoother than DS1, and that does not make DS1's any worse.",1
Positive,"I mean, what needs to be said about this game? If you enjoyed the first two, espcially DS1, then you will love this game. Perfect controls, amazing graphics, hard as fuck. Although it is easier than the first installment, there's some pretty gnarly enounters in this game, especially the DLC. If you know nothing about Dark Souls, that's ok. Jump in and let the game take you to pound town. Stick with it, learn from your mistakes and the game is rarely unfair, if ever. You can overcome anything in this game with any combination of weapons and armor and at any level, it's up to your skill to succeed. 10/10, will be playing this game unti l die IRL.",1
Positive,"If the dlc and optional areas are not included, this game is very easy. But if you play the full game along with the dlc and manage to complete it, it will be one of the best experiences you might have. The gothic elements and fast paced combat are just some of the key elements of the game. An amazing end to a true masterpiece franchise.",1
Positive,"DISCLAIMER: If you buy this for co-op, make sure your friend has a way to drop lots of souls so you can level up past 300. If you don't do this, you'll be targeted by PvP trolls who have optimized their builds in order to repeatedly invade your game and harass you. In my opinion, having an overleveled character won't impact your experience as much as those nuisances will. At this point in the game's life, you're better off playing with a friend you already know instead of trying to play with randoms. That being said, I rate this game 10/10. I originally 100% completed Dark Souls III on PS4. For newcomers to the soulslike experience, there is a huge learning curve. Nothing else on the market is quite like Dark Souls.It feels like being thrown from godliness to having someone plant your feet in the ground. In Dark Souls, you are nothing, and everything is better than you. It's your job to use your wits and overcome such profound weakness. First and foremost, this game requires patience, ingenuity, and a ""never give up"" mentality. One of the most satisfying feelings this game can give you comes after you fail, come up with something new, and succeed. You have to stay sharp, remember your limits, and work with what you have. The combat is methodical and intense. Button mashers should expect a great struggle, as pressing a button one too many times can result in death during the most simple enemy encounters. It takes well into your first playthrough to fully grasp the number crunch that happens when you equip armor or level up. However, once you begin to understand why stats work the way they do, you'll start realizing how intuitive and sensible it all is, as if you were leveling up your own human body. No challenge is impossible. Nothing is against the rules. If you're struggling, you're forced to analyze your flaws, perfect your techniques, or find new situational approaches. The critical thinking and willpower required to finish this game might even lead to self improvement habits in the real world. The multiplayer aspect of this game has lived and died. Unless you follow my disclaimer directions, you're unlikely to have pleasant experiences. However, playing this game with a friend is 1000% cooler. You get to dance around enemies, distract, find ways to compliment each others' playstyles, and take turns 1v1ing enemies. You'll get to have some great memories of working together to overcome challenges. Think: ""Let me go first. While the enemies are chasing me, you can grab the items then attack them from behind."" Your friend runs off, gets swarmed and dies, you berate one another, laugh it off, and come up with a new plan. It adds a whole new dynamic element to the game, and helps you realize how well simulated the world is. Some of my best memories from DS3 are of challenging my friends to do wild things, like fighting bare-fisted against late game enemies. This game has a lot of content. You might find yourself spending hours creating your character, planning how to level up, or looking forward to the next weapon or outfit you'll find. There are plenty of enemies, bosses, navigation challenges, and areas to explore. If you have the insatiable thirst of curiosity, you might even spend most of your time reading descriptions and discovering how everything in the world ties together. If you're that kind of person, here's a tip: everything in DS3 exists for a reason, so there's plenty to figure out. After you finish the game the first time, don't be afraid to look up quest or location guides. There are lots of hidden, obscure elements to Dark Souls 3 that one might never discover unless they read about it first. Thanks for reading my review. Hopefully it will help a few late stragglers :) Game hard. Trial and error. Feel good to win. Interesting world. Better with friend. Lot to do. Collect-athon. Buy!",1

Full Steam Controller support with multiple action sets for Ingame, Menu and Inventory, as well as Developer presets.Summary: Must have for any souls fan. The best Souls game in the series and a fitting end to the trilogy without relying too much on throwbacks to previous dark souls games.

The world makes sense as it was in 1, but with the superior Combat and Quality of Life changes of 2.

Positive,"For the longest time, I always thought I could never derive enjoyment from a Souls-like game. But, this game changed everything, and by everything I mean, a very specific genre of games called souls-likes, and considering gaming is everything, then essentially it changed a small part of everything.Anyway morale of the story is, the game is surprisingly extremely gorgeous, there were quite a few jaw dropping moments when it came to the environment/scenery/bosses. I didn't even mind the relentless cycle of death to the same bosses, It made me adapt, learn and overcome. In most games your character progressively gets stronger and more powerful as the journey progresses, and even though that may be the case too for Dark Souls, that isn't really the focus, in this case : the player behind the character improving is the real difference maker.",1

So make of that what you will. For me personally it took way more time to adapt to the new rhythm of things than I'd like to admit, but it grew on me.

Devs try and try and try but no one gets close to how good the combat, visuals and sense of exploration is in the souls series. Nioh, The Surge, Lords of the Fallen and Dragons Dogma have some souls inspiration but they can t even get near Myazaki s scent for gaming and the aroma of mechanics brewed by his masterful mind. DS3 has some cool bosses and weapon arts are a fun new addition to the series. Honestly, even if it didn t have anything new only exploring and fighting is fun.",1
Positive,"I've put off the Dark Souls series for a long time now, I couldn't see the appeal for it. After a sale, and a little research I bought the game. The moment I arrived in that graveyard I became completely engrossed in the story and the lore. I can't stand using a controller for any game, so I use keyboard and mouse for this, which has worked fine for me. The combat is very good, and fluid and the boss fights are the best I've ever seen. I also love how you can shape your character into whatever you want them to be. The game is visualy very appealing, and the world is absolutely gorgeous. If you are putting this game off, buy it like I did, I think you'd really like it. 10/10",1
Positive,"My views on this game are very conflicted. While I think it is a fantastic game, all I can feel towards it is disappointment. It feels more like a greatest hits album or a fan fiction project for fans of the Souls series than a conclusion to Dark Souls. Every time I thought it was telling its own story, it turned out to be a reference to one of the other Souls games. There are Dark Souls references everywhere you look, some being completely needless. So if you thought DS2's allusions were too much, be ready for the ride of your life. It is actually tough to find story elements in this game that are not referencing one thing or another. Sometimes it feels like that's all the game's story is.Like I said though, the game itself is tremendous. It is perhaps the best playing, looking and sounding Souls game ever made and I absolutely recommend it to everyone - fans and non-fans alike - you will have a blast. I myself will probably play this for many hundreds of hours to come, but it will never replace what I have in my heart for Dark Souls (1).",1

Positive,"As someone who is deeply enamored with the dark fantasy genre, Souls Series, and particularly with works such as Berserk, I can confidently state that Dark Souls 3 holds an incredibly important place in my heart. In my opinion, this game is truly perfect in every aspect, from its gameplay style to its combat mechanics, design, and even its soundtrack.What truly stands out to me about Dark Souls 3 is the incredible richness of detail that can be found in every aspect of the game. Whether you are exploring the beautifully crafted scenarios or battling against a host of terrifying monsters, there is a level of intricacy and attention to detail that is simply unmatched.One of the things that I particularly appreciate about Souls games in general is the way in which it manages to seamlessly integrate its story and lore into every aspect of the game. From the items that you collect to the enemies that you encounter, there is always some new piece of information to discover about the world. This creates a truly immersive experience that is both engaging and deeply satisfying.In terms of gameplay mechanics, Dark Souls 3 is equally impressive. The combat system is both challenging and rewarding like in other souls games, requiring a great deal of skill and strategy in order to succeed. All in all, I would say that Dark Souls 3 is an incredible game that truly deserves all of the praise and accolades that it has received. Its price is more than deserved for such an incredible work.From the biggest fan of the Souls Series on the universe,Alisa.",1

Positive,"I can once again recommend this game now that online multiplayer is restored. It had been taken down in response to an exploit, and the developers took significantly longer to restore multiplayer than they had led the community to expect from them.As far as actual gameplay goes, this is a really fun game to play. The controls are very responsive, and when enemies kill you, it always feels like you know what you could have done differently in order to survive, whether it is positioning or timing or stamina management. The PvE experience in this game is so fair that you can even make up for any deficit in levels or equipment by simply having enough skill, something that is almost unheard of in this genre. That said, certain builds and preparation can make some of the boss fights significantly easier.Dark Souls 3 is one of the best cooperative experiences you can find in video games. It is one of the few games where playing with - or against - random people on the internet actually feels good most of the time. Getting into the multiplayer in this game is much easier than in the other two Dark Souls games because the items are available in the central hub and the password matching system is easy to use.",1

It's endlessly replayable, endless playstyles you can choose, tons of loot, endless secrets, challenging battles and progression that MEANS something to you, even if you've done it a hundred times or more. Then the PvP, a lot of people don't like it, but god damn it adds such a lovely element to the game to be able to summon random strangers and have a blast without being able to communicate, and then cheese an invader, or get cheesed off a cliff, by the invader. Stunning game, great graphics, great narrative.Oh, and the best part of the game, isn't even the gameplay, which is stunning in and of itself.

Positive,"Dark souls 3 is the best Dark souls because its actually enjoyable to play. The story revolves around a bunch of Lords not coming into work and your quest to find them, beat them and drag their remains back to their assigned seats. After which attendance is taken and you travel through the power of imagination to a that fire world from Chronicals of Riddick to fight the living embodiment of fire or some nonsense. The story itself is told to you by pleasant voiced white guys on youtube, which is a bold choice by the japanese publisher. Everyone speaks in Ye' olde Englesh depsite the fact that;1- England isnt a thing in The Souls Verse2- No other reason. The key to success in Dark Souls 3 is playing BIG SOULS. Whats BIG SOULS? BIG SOULS is when you eat everyone around you. Bosses souls can be made into weapons but fuck that you got macros to achieve. Word on the street is that there is a boss who got big by eating people? EAT HIM. Is that a guy he's eating when you fight him? EAT HIM TOO. Whats that? One guy is possibly the legitmate son of the one god-king of this land, and is completely optional? EAT HIM. He rides a dragon? EAT THAT AS WELL. Dump everything you can into vitality and carry weight and watch as people just cant keep up. There is multiplayer but its garbage.",1

Positive,"Painful, yet addicting. Kinda like BDSM.",1
Positive,"To me, Dark Souls 3 is the best out of the series; I felt I spent less time dying to jumping puzzles, rolling off ledges during fights, being completely lost and running to boss areas repeatedly from Bonfires after dying. In other words, I felt I spent a lot less time dying to stupid things and more time dying to actual mobs and bosses in the game; which are certainly harder than usual due to the lack of poise and the pace of the game being faster.I will be completely honest, I really enjoy simply playing through Dark Souls 3 and have now done so multiple times and will be continuing to do so. There are very few bosses I find that are unenjoyable compared to the other Souls games and by far the best thing is that the level design is probably one of the best out of the Souls series - Farron\'s Swamp area is a massive pain though, since you dont have an \""Iron Ring\"" like in Dark Souls 1 and you will probably lack anti-poison items.It will be interesting to see what the DLC will bring to the table this time since after all very few would disagree that this was the shortest Souls game so far.Although while I was lucky not to ever get into contact with the problems involving Hackers and the softbans, I did have some problems with fps drops in certain areas and the lack of any real change in NG+s will move my overall score down because of these issues; which I cannot ignore.Overall though I think its fair to give Dark Souls 3 a, 8.5/10",1
Positive,"(Jolly Cooperation has never looked this gorgeous~)Dark Souls 3 can be best compared to a grand piece of music.It starts off fairly slow, with a simple beat. (Well, boss)But as time progresses, as you push further into the story itself, the beat gradually intensifies with each boss you fell, until you find yourself lost amongst the games intricate level design, the heart-pounding OST, and the interesting cast of NPCs you can meet.In no way is this a perfect game.None of the Souls are really, they all have their flaws, yet they remain heavily enjoyable due to their unique style.I would even go so far as to say this game even surpasses Dark Souls 1, 1 which has reigned unchallenged for many a year now.I heavily recommend this to others, but mainly I would recommend this to people who have experienced 1. 3 borrows heavily from it, and I highly recommend either playing 1, or researching the lore before beginning 3.You will be all the richer for it, I assure you.",1
Positive,"Third installment of dark souls series. A masterpiece. Mostly every aspect from older games is improved and refined. Dark souls 3 offers seamless combat fluidity, (for some) interesting storytelling, best multiplayer.

Positive,"Not the best of the Series, but a very good game none-the-less. Good combat design for PvE and well balanced weapons for both PvP and PvE. A good game to play with friends for fun and to challenge yourself alone with. There's just one small caveat; The most recent DLC was deceptively short, not putting much out for PvE. But the DLC also offers the best solution to the PvP system by adding an Arena.",1
Positive,"Overall amazing, great exploration (Edit: since I wrote this review early on in my first play-through, I didn't really know what I was on about. There isn't too much exploration, especially in the base game, but their also isn't too litte. It is very linear for most of the game, usually with 2 or 3 paths through. The DLCs, especially Ashes of Ariandel, are more open than that and actually do have a great deal of exploration in them. Having completed the game with DLCs 7 or 8 times at the time of this edit, I can safely say that there is enough exploration to say that there is exploration, but my previous statement of ""great exploration"" isn't entirely correct) combined with varied and interesting combat it is brilliant. Various NPCs make it interesting, especially as most of them if not all do something good for you depending on what you want.TLDR; p good, walk around for a bit, talk to people, kill things. 8.5/10",1

Positive,"A fantastic return to form for the Souls games. Unfortunately still not perfection. so close every time. Nonetheless, a very worthy sequel to one of the greatest games of all time.",1
Positive,"As a product in and of itself, Dark Souls III is excellent. Were it not for the monumentally stupid decision to remove poise, the fundamentals of the game would be by far the best in the series. Actions are faster, recovery seems more natural, healing is back to just being estus flasks, and magic uses a pretty ingenius mixture of the Demon's Souls mana bar and the estus flask system. Covenants no longer require a ring slot and can be switched out at anytime. The game is beautiful, with significantly darker coloration and lighting than Dark Souls 2. DS3 also gets rid of one of my least favorite aspects of DS2, the terribly ugly font. (The menu system is a bit worse, though not by a particularly noticeable margin.)The level design is for the most part great. Even when it is not quite so great, it is leagues above the worst levels in DS1/DS2. Enemy placement seems to have finally returned to a more natural and fair level-in DS3 you regularly fight more than 6 enemies at once, but it never feels quite as ridiculous as it was in DS2 because the enemies are designed with this in mind. I should note however that some enemies break this mold, and that is not the only thing that they break. There are a small handful of enemies in the game that seem to blatantly ignore collision and conventional movement mechanics, which can make them seem unfair. This is most noticeable in the game's various dogs, which constantly clip into walls. There was even one point where I was exploring an area above a basement and a dog floated through the ceiling of the basement and jumped at me. I have a screenshot of an instance where I was playing with my friend and a Valkyrie enemy literally spun himself right into the inside of a wall and got permanently stuck. I would accept this kind of thing in a game like New Vegas, which has a more humorous universe, but in a game like Dark Souls, this lack of polish is kind of shocking. It's like the gargoyles in Anor Londo from DS1-if they didn't fly right, why put them in the game at all. In spite of this I would still say DS3 has better enemies than any of the other souls games. The Evangelists, Irythlll swordswomen and Demon Pyromancers being particularly capable and enjoyable enemies to fight.It's only with perspective of the previous games that DS3 reveals some pretty pervasive flaws. Tonally, the game is a complete mess. Dark Souls 1 was about a world crumbling to dust, Dark Souls 2 was about desolation and the hopelessness of an endless curse. After finishing it and all it's side-content, I.honestly don't know what Dark Souls 3 was about. Areas have vastly different stories and justifications, which is good, but also bad-it literally feels like you're walking through entirely different worlds, which is not helped by the linear world design. NPC stories are complete absurdity, the only character in the entire game that mostly acts within reasonable standards is Siegward, who is quite literally Siegmeyer with a different name. I would be more ok with this if the NPCs were vendor-lobotomites like Majula in DS2, but not only is it a chore to even find your vendors, but many of them can actually reach a worse state of being by completing their questline. This includes the ""good"" endings. I can very well imagine people never finding the miracle vendor during their first playthrough, they are so out of the way that it is outright ridiculous. (More reason to believe that From hates Faith builds, I guess.) The hex vendor is also extraordinarily difficult to find, though I can at least understand this as hexes are supposed to be end-game level spells.The game seems to want the player to spend a long period of time around the Firelink Shrine, which is why you can only level up at the firekeeper unlike DS1. This is also the likely reasoning for why there are far more bonfires in this game than any other souls title. Yes, even DS2. Tension is effectively murdered by this. And for what, I wonder? The Firelink Shrine is very annoying to navigate, significantly worse than the hub worlds in any of the previous game. Walls are everywhere which makes it hard to ever get a complete grasp of where the vendors are. I should also mention that the Firekeeper in DS3 is by far the worst hub lady in the series. I am starting to get very tired of this archtype, they rarely offer anything at all other than things the player should already be able to do.Speaking of archtypes, I don't actually mind the ""fanservice"" in the game, which is a common complaint. I don't exactly think it's brilliant storytelling, but for the most part the archtypes in the game are clear improvements to the characters they orignated from. Hawkwood is the only Crestfallen Warrior in the series that I can actually tolerate. Patches' appearance in the Cathedral was one of my favorite moments in the entire game, and I find it hard to take seriously anyone who complains about his reappearance when it was done so well. If this really is the last Souls game, I can understand Miyazaki wanting to give some finality to his favorite creations. The stuff that is new in the game is extremely compelling. Nearly all of the bosses in the game have excellent environmental storytelling. I also loved that all of the bosses in the game, even the really bizzare ones, had a clear impact on the world around them. This compared to DS2's constant feeling of ""Why am I fighting this guy again?""I must mention something about the endings:First of all, they all suck. Second, it's insulting at this point that putting out the first flame is not a default option. It is made blatantly obvious throughout the game that linking the fire is not a good idea, and yet we need to find some eyes to talk to people about it. It should have been made an option by default the second they wrote Lorian and Lothric's dialogue.",1

Dark Souls III a dark experience where we can find beauty on sadness and shadows. Yes it does not have the same precision on hit boxes like Elden Ring and also does not have crouch or leap mechanics, BUT it has everything else, including a unique experience each zone with almost no boss repeating. I recommend this to those who want a complete journey on a fantasy world with incredible loot system, itemization and layouts. It's not an open world experience, but it's a masterpiece experience. 535 hours? I will play more for sure again!",1
Positive,"I finally 100%'d this game after 200 hours. It may be old, but it sure was a journey going through it. I've been playing this game since 2017, and I am actually surprised at how active people still are- I still get the occasional invasion and I still find people to summon for boss fights.At first, you'll find it insanely difficult, but as you progress and get better, you'll find that beating the bosses only takes a little bit of patience to dodge the attacks and take it one hit at a time. It may seem daunting to lose all your souls but you'll get to a point where they don't actually really matter that much.This game is a masterpiece, I played through it 4 times and still enjoyed it every step of the way. Even if its age was showing at times, it is still a magnificent work of art.I recommend that you play it now, especially with the price.9/10And A fine Dark Soul to you!",1
Positive,"This game is living up to the expectations of the original Dark Souls game. Personally, I'd like to view this as the second installation in the series, but one can only be so lucky. If you were a fan of the original Dark Souls, you'll be satisfied with the level design (Thank YOU, Miyazaki), combat system, and interesting new NPCs. The environment looks beautiful and lots of unique and fun armor combinations. However, there is a fly in the ointment. The PC port performance is utter trash, and understandably from a game developers point of view they build these ports within a vaccum, using only a few hardware systems, until they release it to the public where there are countless numbers of hardware and software configurations. With that being said, time heals all, and I'm certain there will be incoming patches to fix many of the common performance issues and bugs customers are discovering.Even with the performance issues, my experience playing this game has been astounding. FROM has done an excellent job rounding off the corners on many features the original Dark Souls had but executed poorly, or was compromised in the name of finishing the game on time. Namely, the magic, stats, and combat systems. These systems were OK in the orginal title, but they could've been so much more. With Miyazaki back at the helm, Fromsoft has updated that structure while maintaining the consistent, well-balanced and re-playable gameplay system for RPers, Speedrunners, and PvPers that we players have come to expect from the franchise.I've got to say, I was very apprehensive about the new Focus Power (FP) or 'magic bar', but surprisingly, it works really well with the addition of weapon skills/stances. It gives purpose to magic (both lore-wise and combat-wise) to all character classes. The original 'you-only-get-this-many-uses' structure seemed rushed and unpolished, but it worked for what FROM needed to accomplish within their time constraint. This new FP system is much better. Players now have two estus flasks, alloting charges to each however he sees fit. One recharges HP, the other FP. So, if your character isn't a magic user, allot all your charges to HP. If your character has healing spells or powerful magic, allot more to FP. Its a great system!Once again FROM has redefined what stats do, and for the better. One of the biggest problems in Dark Souls was the Resistance stat. Nobody ever used it because it was far less effective to point into it when you could point into Endurance or Vitality. Besides, it didn't do much armor couldn't already provide. Endurance used to increase Stamina and Equipment Load. Now it increases Stamina and Lightning and Bleeding resistance. Vitality used to increase max health, now it increases Equipment Load and Physical Defense and Poison Resistance, where Vigor now increases max health and Frost Resistances. Attunement increases your slottable magics while increasing max FP. Strength, Dexterity, Intelligence and Faith are still basically qualifier stats. They provide Fire Resistance, Decrease Casting Time & Fall Damage, Magic Defense, and Dark Resistances, respectively. Dark Souls 2 also changed how stats worked, adding an additional stat, Adaptability, and removing the Resistance stat entirely. However in many ways, it fell flat. It created another qualifier stat on top of Str, Dex, Int, and Faith, especially in PvP. The Dark Souls 3 stat system is truly well-balanced and it will be interesting to see what the 'optimal' PvP level will be in the game.The addition of Weapon Skills has provided an almost endless opportunity for PvP character builds. Shields now provide access to unique combat moves depending on the shield and weapon type by pressing the L2 button. Some shields parry, some shields bash, others allow the Weapon Skill of the right-handed weapon. Without the shields, simply two-handing the weapon will allow the same functionality for the Weapon Skills. These Skills can range from a temporary Damage boost, to unique move sets, to special magic attacks and it all depends on the weapon your character is wielding. The Skills cost FP to use, so even quality builds will have a choice between alloting FP estus or developing their Attunement stats, garnishing the idea for simple pyromancies or heals. There are also now inherent 'dual-wield' weapons where normal ""two-handing"" of the weapon actually allows your to dual-wield. No more hours of farming or multiple runs to find two weapons of the same type!Upgrade paths have been updated to fit in bit more variety. You will find new Heavy, Sharp, and Refined, along with Deep, Simple, and Hollow upgrade paths. Heavy upgraded weapons freeze scaling on Dex and increase scaling on Strength. Sharp does exactly the opposite. Refined scales for both Strength and Dex, but decreases the base damage of the weapon to a greater degree. Deep upgrades add Dark Damage, Simple upgrades add magic damage and adds FP recovery (I am assuming with every successful hit or kill), and Hollow upgrade is quite strange. Not only does it increase your Luck stat while Hollow, but it also scales with Luck. Makes for a very awesome plausibility for farming-based weaponry.Overall, I'd recommend the hell out of this game for any Dark Souls fans. It's brought so much polished-ness to the genre and is a great way to wrap up the series. If you're on a tight budget, wait till patch 1.1 is released to avoid the frustration of performance issues and then buy the game.Cheers.",1
Positive,Best game ever,1
Positive,"Dark Souls 3 is, hands down, one of the best game i've ever played. The massive amount of coustimization that there is in this game is a big part of it. You can start out with one of many character types, and change your approach on what your character specializes in throughout the game. Every single fight has so much more life to them than in any of the other souls games. And the fact that the environments flow together so well adds to that experience in combat. Dark souls 3 is not nearly as frustrating as any other souls game, but at the same time it is more difficult AND more fun than any other souls game. I'm not saying that this game isn't frustrating, there is a good chance that you will have that moment where you will rage quit and send your controller sailing into the wall. Though I have not done that, it surley is tempting at times. This game's replay value makes up for it's flaws in every way, those flaws being difficulty spikes and NPC invaders that are extremely overpowered later on. Even after I beat the game and new game plus, I still wanted to go back and start a new game with a different character type and see how it played out differently for me. This game origionally took me 35 hours to beat WITHOUT Archdragon Peak, the Consumed King's Garden OR any of the DLC's. This was because I kept trying to find new ways to fight and level myself up. I guess you could say. the game isn't hollow! Terrible puns aside, here is my rating: Praising the Sun/10, best game ever. Now prepare to die, a lot, For the fifth time in From Software's series.",1
Positive,"Amazing game ahead,but visions of rage.",1
Positive,"I got the game since it first launched. Bought all the DLC. Played from the first day until the day that most of the unkindled finally burned out.Gameplay wise, it's still the same Dark Souls. The combat is rewarding. To be honest, if you fail at it, it's because you keep rushing in and not thinking. Only spamminh whatever the attack button is and not changing tactics. On the other hand, people who take their time to learn how things work wil be rewarded well. That said, it's still not a hyper fast paced game nor is it a slugfest, but it can be either with the right playstyle.On the bright side, any slow moments are rewarded by great attention to detail on the maps, lots of secrets and breathtaking views. I personally love the ""after the end"" feel of the game.The community is a mixed batch. A lot of people do have some pride and honour. There have been countless times i was invaded and have invaded where the ""Enemy"" and myself challenged each other to a duel with no estus or cheese tactic. There was no system to force either party to abide by those ""rules"", yet most people follow it. In many cases, when a 3rd party comes by to a duel, they'll often sit out and let the duel progress. Some hosts, players who summon phantoms, even create makeshift tournaments. Though, if you try to break duel ""rules"" in any form, expect full retribution from both your opponent and any bystanders who also honour those duels.On the other hand, there are still hackers and cheese builds. There are toxic people who only want to kill. There's also the infamous gank squad who hunt in numbers. but they're all not too bad as long as you don't invade. If you have the first DLC, you can duel in a fairly fair battleground.Tl;dr, get the game. On sale or not, it is worth it.",1
Positive,"Arguably my personal favorite, due to the combat changes and the uniqueness of each weapon and playstyle, plus the smoothness and nimble gameplay.The level design is on a breath-taking level and the nostalgia from meeting with recurring characters from the first game and once again visiting familiar places is purely ecstatic.While there are some frowned upon changes, which not everone agrees with nor welcomes with open arms, in my opinion the game is an absolute cherry on the top of the souls series and worthy to be the final souls game.",1

Positive,"The greatest challenge of Dark Souls 3 is not its enemies, but its obscurity. Learning to navigate its convoluted system of stats is made no easier by its insistence on jumbled terminology. Health potions are Estus Flasks, and maximum health increases through Vigor instead of Vitality, which increases carry weight capacity for some reason. Magic potions are Ashen Estus Flasks, and the player is an Ashen One, which means undead, but not the same kind of undead as friendly NPCs though still just as perfectly alive-looking and not the same kind of undead as the enemies, who are Hollows, but the player can become Hollow. Also, being slightly on fire increases max health by thirty percent, but then murderous, red ghosts can appear out of nowhere and start rolling around. And while that s only the tip of the crazyberg, don t expect Dark Souls 3 to explain any of it. Its tutorial level consists of splashing about in puddles and reading brief descriptions of console controls before a 15-foot, armored death machine slaps your face right off your head. And it never gets any clearer. What little is explained in game is done so in maddeningly esoteric dialog, so instead the player must minimize the screen over and over and over to try and make sense of what the game is saying through other people. This is a tremendous weakness. It is said that this confusion is intentional, but that does not change the fact that consistently having to leave the game in order to understand it is an outright failure. I wouldn t blame anyone for being discouraged from playing Dark Souls 3 due to its clunky, unintuitive nature, but I would strongly urge them to stick with it. Because once the online community helps make sense of the bullshit that the developers wrapped this game in, it is revealed to be a very enjoyable experience.It s a 3D action RPG dungeon crawler reminiscent of the old school Castlevania series. It s also deeply beautiful, with sprawling labyrinths of gothic architecture, and plenty of overlooks from which the player can gaze across a jungle of towers and crumbling stonework. The visual presentation is simply masterful, and enemies are no exception. There are so many variations, each with multiple attacks/abilities, and all of them well-crafted, whether curious, creative, or often downright unsettling. Though it seems with so much careful attention to visual detail there was less room for sound design. There is very little music in the game, most of it occurring during boss battles, and most of it entirely forgettable.Experience points are replaced with souls, which double as currency, and leveling up is as simple as spending an incrementally increasing amount of souls to improve a single stat point by one. Souls drop on death (along with all enemies respawning), but can be recovered should the player return to where they died, so long as they do not die again before collecting, in which case the souls are lost forever. In this way, every bit of progress feels fought for and earned, and the urge to explore is weighed against the caution of large numbers of souls; it is a very compelling balance. The ability to leave messages on the ground for other players allows for a sense of camaraderie as the player is warned against impending ambushes, or alerted to hidden treasure, and also empowers a group of spirited preteens to write, try jumping, at the edge of every fatal cliff. The story is an absolute joke. There isn t one, not in any real sense of the word. Narrative is delivered to the silent protagonist from the various NPCs in an awkward Shakespearian dialect, and so many of them speak in a disinterested monotone followed by disjointed laughter. Motivations are left in the dark, character development is nonexistent, and characterization is incredibly poor. Even after seeing the brief ending and watching all the others online, I could not tell you what s going on in Dark Souls 3, and truthfully, no one can. It s all just speculation, which again is said to be intentional on the part of the developers, and again, is an utter failure. But that s ok; this game does not need story to function. It s not about that so much as it is exploration and gameplay.Gameplay is hack and slash through and through. An arsenal of medieval weaponry, both practical and ridiculous, is lootable or purchasable, with competent design and upgrades allowing even weapons found early on to remain effective until the very end. While there are some clearly superior weapons, Dark Souls 3 seems to largely favor personal style over a narrow power progression. It is possible to specialize in magic as well, but while there are many useful defensive and utility spells, offensive spells often overlap in usefulness, if they are lucky enough to be useful at all. It is more likely that one or two spells found very early on will remain primarily used throughout the entire game, making magic much less varied and interesting than weapon focused builds. Defensively, players are able to block, parry, dodge, or rely on their armor. Blocking, which requires any shield, eats through stamina and will leave the player staggered without heavy investment in gear and stats, but is very reliable in terms of execution. Parrying, which requires specific shields or weapons, will stun an enemy, allowing for a powerful riposte attack, but has a very small window of execution, combined with the fact that attack timing is different, not only for every enemy, but for the multiple attacks available to each enemy, and not all enemies can be parried. Dodging is just free invincibility. It takes stamina, but can still be performed infinitely with no stamina left. It requires no specific equipment, nor stat investment, can reposition the player for flanking, and every attack can be dodged. Armor is really more for looks than anything. Sure, there are different absorption values attached to different armors, but enemies hit so hard, always staggeringly hard, that being hit at all is not sensible. Just pick what makes you feel pretty and keep dodge rolling; it s simply the superior defense.Bosses should get some special mention for Dark Souls 3. Many games today eschew traditional elements of boss battles, but Dark Souls embraces them. Bosses should be difficult; they should hit hard; they should be intimidating, preferably with multiple forms, and these bosses are all these things if the game is played solo. It is fairly simple to play co-op with others online, or even NPCs, which utterly trivializes bosses. There s no downside to playing with others; it s just a way to completely strip the game of difficulty. But even when playing alone, the invisibility spell trivializes any non-boss encounter. Truthfully, I was disappointed with the ever proclaimed difficulty of this game. Having now beat it myself, I can t help but sigh at all those mewling articles online demanding that Dark Souls 3 have any easy mode, when in fact it needed a hard mode.",1

Positive,"Dark Souls III is without a doubt the best entry in the trilogy of games. Dark Soul I and II are both bereft of problems and issues with quality that DSIII deftly escapes, leaving an incredible experience that rivals Bloodborne, one of the best games of the eighth generation of consoles. It's also a solid finale, with a good sense of closure that will stick with you.* PlotDark Souls III is much like it's predecessors in that it's vague. Little is explained to the player, forcing them to make logic connections between plot threads to reach answers. The enviroment itself tells a story, requring the player to make judgements based on what they see, hear and read. Item descriptions hide chunks of lore that explain everything from character identities and outfits to who they are and what they want. The plot itself is sparse, though some lategame revelations had me reeling. Overall, it's a good ending to the franchise, and i'm eagerly awaiting the DLC to wrap up some of the games' missing story threads. Dark Souls III's biggest problem in the story department, then, is that it refuses to stop jerking DSI off. The amount of references to Demons Souls, DSI and DSII feel incredibly awkward a lot of the time. Some are good, like characters being direct references to people in the first two games yet taking on new roles and personalities, and others are just pathetic ""praise the sun!"" stuff. It takes you out of the experience when theres such a frequency of them, and it also feels like the creators aren't carefully referencing their other material as they are copying it. The tasteful Demons Souls references are a nice touch however, and show that FROM has not ignored their first game in this style.* DesignDark Souls III has some of the best designed levels in the series. It's challenging without ever feeling unfair, and I died a number of times due to my own incopotence. Levels loop back around on themselves, revealing shortcuts, hidden areas and more with rather incredible abandon. The game will hide stuff from you very easily, and will often reward your troubles with loot or something else. The secret areas of the game are VERY secretive, requiring a hell of a lot of patience and careful exploration to uncover them all. The enemies are also a challenge as well, and some of the tougher ones can require multiple tries until they're vanquished. Despite this good, Dark Souls III really feels like it holds your hand some times. The frequency in which there are bonfires feels incredibly patronizing at times, and the game never feels like it's really challenging you with the scarcity of them. It's rare that unlocking a shortcut feels good, but when it does it feels great. The game is also obviously unfinished once more. While not to the rather extreme extent of DSII, it is painfully obvious that this game couldn't fit everything it wanted in, and that the developers were running out of time. One example of this is the games runtime (20 hours), which is incredibly short compared to DSI and II, though this isn't a problem as the game never stops being good- even the hardest, most frustrating areas are much better paced and way more fun than the worst areas of DSI and II., meaning the game never drags through terrible areas like Blightown or the Undead Crypt. Another irritating thing is that many of the improvements from DSII, from online to gameplay, are completely removed, setting the legitimate evolution of PvP in DSII back a few steps. Magic has also been nerfed quite a bit, and I feel like it's become too costly to use. Melee seems to be the way to go, and it's sad to see that only a few playstyles can really work given DSI's incredible flexibility in this regard.*EDIT*After discussion with friends it's become apparent that this balance issue has gotten out of hand. Magic is still useless in comparison to swords, Pyromancy still needs heavy tuning, and slower weapons like greatswords are useless due to their average scaling, meaning they won't do as much DPS as a straight sword. However, none of this is as bad as the poise problem, which is such a glaring and horrible oversight. I won't discuss it here, but suffice to say that poise functions much different in this game than in the second and first, and it's a terrible substitute for the function in the first game. From needs to get their shit together and fix these issues because it's starting to become a serious, game hampering issue. Also PvP is hot fucking garbage, is super unbalanced, etc.* GameplayThe gameplay of DSIII is very much refined from the first two games. DSIII is faster, tougher and better than the first two games. Enemies are stronger and hit faster, requiring careful dodging and percise strikes. This makes for an incredibly tense experience in every single encounter, and makes the game incredibly fun against even the average mook. Bosses are better than ever, with some of the most creative and interesting fights in the series. Covenants are back and a lot of them are quite fun, with some classics from the first game returning gloriously, and the game allows you to switch them on the fly, going from glorious Sunbro to backstabbing Rosiarias Fingers in the matter of moments. This game also reintroduces the magic meter from Demons's Souls, but with an added twist- weapons can now perform special attacks which drain this bar. These moves can be anything from a guard-breaking upward swing to sending out a stream of fire, and they make each normal, special, and boss-made weapon feel incredibly unique and add to the playstyle of that weapon. Now a sword and board user can be much more dangerous as he can easily break your guard, and spear users can become even deadlier with their horrificly long gap closing attacks, to say nothing of the incredibly cool and badass special attacks of the boss soul weapons. The gameplay is overall a massive improvement on DSII.* PresentationMusic is as usual fantastic and LOUD, though not to the height of Bloodborne- some tracks do come close, however, such as the amazing final boss theme ( DON'T LISTEN TO IT IF YOU HAVEN'T BEATEN THE GAME BECAUSE IT CONTAINS SPOILERS) The game also looks stellar, boasting the graphical improvements of Bloodbornes new engine to create some excellent locales. Many of the games locations look absolutely stunning, and contain some really excellent enviromental design. The game has a lot of technical issues, however, and whenever I entered a new area the game would horrifically stutter. I've also heard that the game has a lot of other techincal problems, so stay wary if you don't have a good PC. The game ran pretty well, and never dropped below 30 FPS for my game running on High, so just be careful.*OverallDSIII is an excellent conclusion to a great series, and I eagerly await the DLC in order to see what else FROM can squeeze in to what could be one of their strongest releases. Until they fix the problems with magic and builds, however, this will remain a flawed but fun game.8.1/10> Pros-Excellent design-beautiful world-fun, deep and satisfiying gameplay> Cons-patronizing design in many places-technical issues-many playstyles are bad, only a few can really carry you",1
Positive,"Dark Souls 3 is the most polished Dark Souls game yet because it has obviously learned from the mistakes of Dark Souls 1 & 2. And yet Dark Souls 3 is also the least interesting Dark Souls game because there are few weird and strange enemy and encounters. I love Dark Souls because you must defeat difficult enemy by learning the game and taking risks so you can be rewarded. Well, Dark Souls 3 doesn't have many super difficult enemy, most of the game is pretty similar and there very few interesting rewards. Unlike in Dark Souls 1 & 2, I wouldn't say playing online is recommended anymore. There is maybe two or three difficult bosses if you are offline only. When you are playing online in ""ember"" form (aka human-form or unhollowed), you rarely get invaded and you can easily summon skilled players to be your allies so you can destroy any invader & boss. It's not interesting when you summon a Sunbro ally who defeats the boss while you watch. I would have to place my summon sign so I could help others defeat that boss a few times so I could feel some satisfaction from the boss fight. And as always, using a gamepad is strongly recommended.TL;DR Dark Souls is more Dark Souls and I cannot say I didn't enjoy Dark Souls 3 even though it is the least interesting Dark Souls game. For Dark Souls newbies I would recommend you try Dark Souls 2, maybe Dark Souls 1 if you want a challenge. And for Dark Souls Veterans:- The world is more open than DS2 (less linear)- Weapons are very balanced- convenant variety- offline friendly- very few rage inducing enemy- very few rage inducing enemy- the easiest Dark Souls game- the shortest Dark Souls game- The least variety of Bosses- there aren't any serious consequences to the covenants- All magic is mostly useless for damage until you have very high-level sorcery- Magic is far too slow for PvP- online friendly - a few connectivity improvements since DS2- The world isn't as open as DS1- Camera is still retarded",1

Positive,"While this game is basically a giant fanservice pack, it's an undeniable improvement on the concepts that Dark Souls and Demon's Souls brought to the table. Controls feel much smoother compared to DS1, and animations are more fluid and lifelike than DS2. The reintroduction of mana-based casting allows for more flexible spells (but see below). Weapon designs, while somewhat lacking in their special abilities, are very well done and the sheer variety of movesets rivals DS2's arsenal. Lore for the setting is more focused, allowing the full story to be more easily parsed by players interested in understanding Lothric (albeit at the cost of some conflicting info). NPC plots are very fleshed out, making it rewarding to play through their subplots. It does require a guide to finish all NPCs' subplots in a single playthrough though. The soundtrack is incredible, with no bosses sharing a track (something the older games did). System requirements are fairly low, allowing for easy streaming. The game has a brutal sense of punishment. Multiplayer is much smoother by comparison to older installments. As a special bonus they added the password system from Bloodborne to make co-oping much more tolerable (and removed Soul Memory). The changes made to spellcasting enable a mindless playstyle in PvP, something DS2 handled slightly better. Connection issues do still occur, particularly when you're not the host, and these issues have been in the game since launch. Some serious bugs still exist, ranging from minor exploits (like quickly quitting out to prevent dying to gravity) to major problems (various out-of-bounds being used to ""cheat"" in PvP). A plethora of enemies in this game have ""unfair"" mechanics. While these issues existed in older installments it's particularly pronounced in this game due to changes in the gameplay. Nearly the entire game has no guidance, necessitating a wiki or walkthrough, which invites spoilers. The reliance on fanservice can make this game feel very unwelcoming for new players. Modders and Cheat Engine users can utterly ruin the game, as the anti-cheat in this game can hit their victims through no fault of the player (example: A modder can force PvP with a non-modder and just jump off of a cliff to flag the non-modder's account as a cheater due to details involving the XP system). The only fixes involve Family Sharing or keeping an abnormal amount of backups for your save data and reverting the save immediately after a modder shows up. Bandai Namco will reverse a ban, ONCE AND ONLY ONCE, provided you delete your character's save data. This installment is largely more linear than older games. While there are optional areas the only honest sequence break is gated by a boss a majority of the game considered to be excessively difficult (and that boss is a late-game fight despite being available after clearing the tutorial). Much like DS2, DS3 loves throwing a swarm of enemies at you all over the place. It isn't as egregious as 2, but there are honestly some areas that are just teeming with too many enemies. PvP has less depth than DS2, and when you're not dealing with modders you're fighting a legion of gankers.I'm putting this here as a separate note: The DLCs are absolutely worth it. The story and fights they contain is almost on par with the Old Hunters DLC for Bloodborne, or the Shivering Isles for Oblivion. The base game os a solid experience on it's own but the DLCs together turn Dark Souls 3 into a genuine treat to play.",1

D:LOVE this game!- It's a tough game to get used to and if you don't take your time with it the first time you play through, you're going to die many more times than if you gave it the cautionary approach.- It's OK to look up how to defeat certain bosses, how to find certain hard-to-find npcs, and how to get all the Titanite Slabs in the game because they can be very easy to miss and you DO NOT want to miss them!- If you CAN'T beat a boss, summon a buddy or random player from the ground to help you out! Or go solo and learn the boss attack patterns; whatever suits your fancy :P- Dodging should be your primary way of not getting hit, shield is only used for last minute defenses and/or parrying if you can pull it off.- PVP will always be a thing that pops up! My suggestion there is to spend your souls on leveling up on your first playthrough; whenever you kill a boss or accumulate a large number of souls, port yourself back to the Shrine and spend them on leveling up and/or materials like enhancement mats or consumables (Can look up what you'll need most as you go through the game) Losing souls is always a bummer, but if you have no souls to lose, then it's whatever! :D- If you have a summoned person with you, you're more likely to get invaded by a RED PHANTOM so just keep that in mind. Also fighting red phantoms raises your battle prowess so I take it like an extra boss fight.- If you get invaded at a bad time, A GOOD STRATEGY is to run back to a bonfire area, rather than keep going ahead, that way if you die, you will respawn right next to your souls! <3- This game is tough in beginning, so always assume you will have to rerun through the areas a few times, but it get easier as you play more!- I am NOT a pvp person, but I player so much PVP in this game! Some players have an unwritten ""Code"" of respect and it can be really interesting when you meet those people. Just don't ASSUME every person you fight will follow that Code!- Block hackers who invade by going to your Steam's Recently played (with) Shift + TAB and it'll be on that screen, and block the guy who invaded (HINT: If they have less than 100 hours is a pretty good indicator that they didn't spend the time to ""Git Gud""!)- Heavy Armor is not always the best armor. I use Standard Knight's Armor for my late game pvp and I win the vast majority of my fights in it.- Stamina is great to focus on so you can get it to 25 or so when you first start out as it's how you do anything in the game!- Vitality is not worth investing in just so you can wear heavy armor!- This game in general needs to be taken in as a game you can't rush through- Take your time, plan ahead and you won't die as much, and WHEN you die, the impact will not be so bad!- Enjoy Dark Souls!

Alas, it all began on a fai, ever since my friend steam-shared it with me a couple years ago. I had obviously heard of the game for its notorious difficulty, but I had never considered playing it, EVER. I was a filthy League of Legends player (and still am, kind of) who had only played a couple Pokemon and Mario games (and Minecraft :D) prior. Why would I ever consider playing a Dark Fantasy Action-RPG like Dark Souls III? Well, apparently it's predecessor was hailed as one of the greatest games ever made, and this one was similar, except up-to-date and faster. Soooooooooo I tried it, and WOW! Frankly, I'd never gotten my ass handed to me like DS3 had, let alone by a video game. I gave up soon after, like I did whenever losing a bunch of ranked games on LoL. What's the point? Where's the fun in this? What kind of insane person purchases a video game only to be severely demoralized by said game minutes later?A few weeks passed. I was bored, and didn't have anything better to do, so let's play DS3 again, why not! After a 132849378298213253 ""YOU DIED""s, I came to the conclusion that this game simply wasn't for me.

Positive,"I absolutely love DS3 I have been a big souls game fan since i played Demon Souls while deployed in Iraq. This Game is challenging and not for the faint of heart, It will definitely without a doubt make you mad a few times but that crave to want to complete whatever part you're on or the need to find out whats next will always keep you coming back for more. I cant even tell you how many times I've started this game over after completing it and i still love it as if it were my first time every run I play. Of course you have to play it for yourself to see why i sound like a high school girl who was just asked to prom lol. I simply love this game it will always and forever be my go to game.",1

Positive,This game is an all time classic game. I have played it for quite a few years and always enjoy the experience.,1
Positive,"got gud, beat game, 10/10",1
Positive,"Dark Souls III is in my opinion the best out of the trilogy. Very nice graphics,tough boss fights and,compared to the other ones,nice gameplay and actually feels very good with no delay (which was a big problem in DS I + DS II imo). I recommend playing this game if you're into hard games! (You can also smash bosses with your friends which is a nice feature but I wouldn't recommend that because the fights get pretty easy by summoning others and that neutralizes the idea of the game)",1
Positive,"My first Dark Souls game and it wont be the last of them I'll play.This game is frustrating at first but you get the hang of it when you get further in, so dont quit when the goings rough.You will die, its a mechanic of the game. So far I am having alot of fun playing and I suggest that you should pick it up for a couple reasons.1. Magic and melee are both fluent and fun to play with their own playstyles to master giving a sense of replayibility.2. Awe inspiring bosses and the lore around them make it a epic experience. 3. Cool graphics.4. Various ways of PVP (even if sometimes clunky) in the forms of duels and or invasions.5. Playing with friends is always fun too.6. THE MUSIC. THE MUSIC. THE MUSIC!My only complaint is that there is a large learning curve when it comes to playing the game and or understanding stats. It might just be me still being kind of new but some of the stat calcs go over my head.In conclusion this game is a masterpiece and is worth a buy. Just be Prepared To Die.",1
Positive,"We all remember the sunny Anor Londo of 2011 and the Shrine of Amana of 2014. And we're glad and sad they're gone.But now.DARK SOULS 3What features it got b****?Great graphics.

Positive,"Wow, just wow.This game is just one of the best singleplayer games i've played in a long time. The combat, the scenery and the lore.Only complaint i'd have would be in the combat, for the kick is w+m1 (or forward+light attack)So happy my friend gave it to me, but i felt guilty so bought the Season Pass.",1
Positive,Could this be a fun?Praise the developer!,1
Positive,I died 7 times before the game finished downloading. 10/10,1
Positive,"I am about 4 hours into the game at the time of this review, and I still can't beat the first boss! This game is no joke, it is very difficult! I like it!",1
Positive,Invaded a world as Kirk of Thorns and taunted the Lord of Cinder with a slav squat 10/10,1
Positive,"It's definetely addictive game. Since it's so hard to a newbee like me, it didn't break me down. Instead it encourage me to practice more to defeat the foes. 10/10 []",1
Positive,"I have never played anything like this. I picked this game up a souls newbie. After my first playthrough i have to admin I was missing out. The game had been hyped up for a long time by my friends who were seasoned veterns of the Franchise, and when it arrived it lived up to the hype for new players like me and my friends. The game and gameplay are fluid and work well. There is a wide varity of movesets and lots of bosses and enemies to kill and explore. every area feels like a whole new experience and this Dark Souls experience has been one of my new favorite gaming Experience! The Pros and Cons is below.-It is challenging and rewarding-Unique variaty of weapons and armor-A player based story with a few possible endings-Replayablility with the New game system (Will Update review upon completion of NG+ and NG++)-Multiplayer is fast to sync and fun with up to 8 people at once (Normally 2-3) in your world.-Framerate and graphics are spot on for what i would expect. Some people one the forums are complaining but most of my friends and I have not had too many issues with this area of the game. Each area definitly gives off its own unique experience with lighting and backdrops.-The Invading System can be fun, but is also annoying when you are constantly invaded over the span of a few minutes. When you start an area, and die, or reset at a bonfire, it leaves an oppertunity to be invaded again in the same area, and it can be frustrating dealing with the same area and getting stuck by invaders.-The Ban waves of the game are insane. I have seen people get banned before even getting to the title screen, and getting banned for no reason other then some drivers for controllers or anything out of the normal. Seriously please fix this.-Minor Spoiler The last boss is not the hardest by far, its sad in my opinion that an optional boss is harder then the final boss (even looking at global stats you can see less beat the Nameless King or Lord of Cinder)Overall I think the game is very fun and worth the money paid for and especially excited for the DLC to come out. I will update this review periodically. As someone who has only played Dark Souls 3, i recomend this for casual gamers and even if you rage you can enjoy the gameplay and learning from your experience makes all the rage worth it in the end.Praise the Sun!",1
Positive,"Such a great game, one of the few capable of leaving you speachless. Before i bought this i had never had any experience with this type of genre, and i didn't really like it either. However after buying this and playing though, killing some of the most badass bosses and using some badass weapons, i regret not purchasing this earlier. This game deserves every penny given to its creators and everyone thats supports it. Please buy this game, but note u need tough patients and great skill.",1
Positive,"After peeking under the Master's tattered loincloth, I have decided that this is indeed a masterpiece.",1
Positive,"Dark Souls 3 is one of my all time favorite games. If you're up for the challenge, you'd be stupid not to play it.",1
Positive,Thank you dark souls.,1
Positive,"I thought it would be an easy game before I started it, since I had 80+ hours of experience in Dark Souls 1. I WAS WRONG. Suprise attacks and tough enemies still got me in the 1st playthough, but overall I would appreciate the producers for maintaining such high standards(difficulty) for a Souls game. You won't feel the estasy of slaying of boss before you died a thousand times on your way to the fog wall. I really appreciate the idea that there are more bonefires(checkpoints) now, however, it is still kind of painful to travel back to firelink shrine to level up when you have plenty of souls. Only one thing to notice, PVP of this game sucks. The invasion always happens when you don't want it. However, I believe co-op is fine, as a pain-reliever for new players.",1
Positive,I got this game thinking. what am i doing? i know im going to dislike it with all the enemies and how difficult it is. but soon after i started playing i couldnt stop playing it. i currently have 78 hours and i bought it within the week. it has by far been one of my favourite games now because of all it has in it. all the enemies you can defeat and the enviornment you can discover.(THIS IS HAS NOW BEEN FIXED) UPDATE: The developers recently shutdown the servers while they try to fix a malicious bug within the games netcode.A large company such as Fromsoft shouldve had this fixed by now since its been a month and a half. So largely they have shutdown the servers and have removed most of the replay value in this game whittling down the community. Its likely that they havent fixed the issue yet because they want sales on their newest title but this is still inexcusable. Until this issue is fixed i will be changing my review from Positive to Negative as this is a complete rip off.,1

Positive,"This is without a doubt the best souls game in the series. Not to say that the other games don't have some better aspects, but Dark Souls 3 takes the cake. There is a small problem with hackers in PvP, but nothing too serious, I have over 800 hours logged and have only had a handful of hackers invade my world. I can't say enough good things about this game. The graphics are on point, the gameplay is immersive and exciting and the difficulty is challenging but fair. I would recommend this game to anyone and everyone.",1
Positive,"As a relative neophyte of the series, Dark Souls 3 feels like the most accessible episode of the series. Gone is the shrinking health bar of DS2, gone are the non replenishing consumables of Bloodborne and the bosses' health pool seems to have been lowered a lot.Unfortunately, i felt like a lot of the areas were too small, and shortcuts too frequent, and the overall result was a diminished feeling of challenge, and with it satisfaction. Oh, and some ""look at me i'm so old-school"" mechanics that should just die are still there, such as unmarked phantom walls that you will need a guide to spot.That being said, Darks Souls 3 remains a great experience, with the variety of approaches that you can take at every challenge set before you, the great level and enemy design and, finally, visuals that live up to their name.+ Traditionally great level and enemy design+ Solid skills, weapons and armor balancement+ Fast paced, enjoyable combat+ The most accessible Souls+ Stable framerate and great graphics- No 21:9 support (Fixed by my man Kaldaien)- Lack of challenge for veterans- Too much missable content without a guide- Repetitive environments (Thank you DLCs)4/5",1
Positive,"I never played Demon Souls and didn't like the orignial Dark Souls when I played it on xbox. I tried Dark Souls 2 about two years ago and wasn't really enjoying myself. I gave up on the series, not understanding what everyone loved about these games. I felt lost and confused and when I would look online for help I was told to just 'get gud.' A few weeks ago my friends started going on a DS bindge, eagarly awaiting the remaster. On a whim I decided to join them and I'm so glad that I did. This game struck a cord with me that hasn't been stuck since The Witcher 3. I sank around 80 hours into this game in two weeks. In my personal opinion if you're not sure about dark souls this is the game you should start with.",1
Positive,"DARK SOULS III, in my opinion, it is probably the best and challenging rpg I've played in 2016-2017.Pros: It's a challenging game with a very interesting and deep lore.The game has a very rewarding combat and loot system that is easy to understand and learn.It is very pretty both visually and audibly.It's a long game so you'll have much to do and learn.Cons: It's not as challenging as the first games.It is very directing so you don't get to explore thet much.Can be grindy sometimes.If you summon another player for a boss (there is summonig system in the game that lets you summon other players) it can get very easy and not as hectic and much less of a challenge than if you played it yourself.Despite the cons that I mentioned It is a really great game and I can tottaly recommend it!9.7/10Melun Approves",1
Positive,"To me the sleekest Souls experience on PC and some of the best value for money I have gotten, even if I did have to buy a controller just for Dark Souls.",1
Positive,"This game is awesome. When you killed a boss, you will be satisfied for certain.",1
Positive,"The game itself is phenomenal even with some of the cheap tricks a lot of enemies pull, plenty of trial and error but souls at the later stage are a huge grind to farm if you want to invest in long term builds to carry you into new game +. The gameplay is smooth and so fluid, the boss movesets really do characterise them as people as well and often times you'll find yourself surprised by any new moves they pull out when they're desperate. It provides layers to boss encounters that feel like either some have an ace up their sleeve or others use their basic moves but in combinations that both make sense but also bump up the fight difficulty. It is unfortunate that the game still has restrictions on random players joining based on level because for people living in regions far from the game's servers hoping someone finds your summon sign is common if you want to repeat bosses. Especially since there is a system in place to scale down player levels to the host's level. Regardless most of the game I experienced alone, and a good amount of sections and bosses I tried to finish with friends and randoms to experience what co-op was like and farm sun medals and the community is fun if you actively avoid elitists. Invasions as a system is still the same, still constant, but I've barely encountered any cheaters. Thanks to the invaders who've given me free items before fighting me though. <3As someone who builds for strength and to be somewhat tanky I'm still pretty sad that shields aren't all that useful for blocking, more reliable to dodge but some have their handy passive quirks so it isn't so bad.",1
Positive,"Great combat tarnished by uninspired, overly grimdark art direction and some really stupid retroactive changes to the lore of the first game.",1
Positive,"From Software always does the same thing over and over again but they do it so fucking well god damn.Dark Souls III in particular is a very polished experience, a great conclusion to the series with incredible designs, music and boss fights.",1
Positive,"the game is phenomenal, great difficulty. the online services were down but now they're back!i originally written a review saying that if you wanted to play the multiplayer for this game, it was unavailable because of an RCE (remote code execution) exploit and elden ring during the time. but they're back now so i'll just say straight up, get this gem of a game, it's really fun and challenging and will make you a man",1

Possibly even best game 2016? :-)This was my first real playthrough of a Dark Souls game and i realy loved it!Just finished my first run after about 40h of play time, and cant wait to get in to NG+!Not a whole lot of story driven RPG games makes you whant to instantly replay them, atleast not from my experience. There s so much to do and so many choices to make, choices that affect the main and side story of the game and its characters in ways i dont know yet. This makes me whant to get right back in to it!The level design is superb and its fun exploring al the nooks and crannies in the search for hidden goodies! Visually the game looks extremely good and sometimes i spent several minutes just looking at the scenery.The fact that the game wont ""hold your hand"" is also refreshing to me. No quest loggs or minimaps to guide you in the right direction. You have to explore and listen to the dialogue from the NPC s to figure out where to go next.I hope to get some friends to play the game aswell so we can do a full co-op playthrough. I think that would give the game a whole new dimension where you can build your character in ways that wouldn t be possible for a solo run (100% Bow focus for example?). We will see. :-)And i haven t even started to test the PVP-side of the game, apart from afew invasions from other players.The variety of builds and the overwhelming amount of gear to try out is also a real treat!10/10 Will definitely play again!",1

Positive,"Game is fantastic, it really is what we were expecting from this 3rd chapter of Dark Souls but sadly, this year like the last one for us pc gamers, many and many games were terribly ported or poorly optimized and Dark Souls 3 isn't an exception, altough it runs smoothly me and many other players occured into many game crashes, driver crashes and pc hard freezings. You may say (at the time of writing) that i only have 1.8 hrs of gameplay but in this little time i crashed 3 times. Sadly i strongly recommend waiting until everything will be fixed. Other than that i can only say positive things about the game.1# Review update: i found temporary solution which 100% works and i've been playing 5 hours without crashing, turn off anti aliasing, msaa, shadows and set lighting to low and play windowed, everything else you can keep it on high/ultra.",1

Positive,Loving the game. I just made it to the title screen,1
Positive,cool game very anime,1
Positive,Tbh better than elden ring?,1
Positive,"I think it has some of a the best bosses period, the fast paced and fluid combat compliments them very much. Another thing that elevates the boss fights is the boss music, there are so many masterpieces within this one game it's actually insane.As for the areas, which is my favorite part about Souls games (bosses being a close second), most of the areas are very unenjoyable to traverse like Farron Keep, Cathedral of the Deep, & Irrithyl Dungeon for ex. Now the game does have a few areas I LOVED like Irrithyl Valley, Ringed City, High Wall Lothric, & Anor Londo. It was so cool revisiting places like Anor Londo or going down to the Smoldering Lake and seeing Capra Demon and Stray Demon carcasses, I was so happy to see all the callbacks to DS1 and even DS2.That pretty much sums up my feelings for DS3, I have no problems other than a lot of the areas. 9.5/10 | My fourth favorite Fromsoft game following Elden Ring, Sekiro, and Dark Souls 1.",1
Positive,"It starts out rather slow, but quickly becomes clear that there are so many different combinations of items, gear, stat-types, and exceptional mapping which varies the way you can play.The player interaction system is one that 'should' have been implemented in previous free-roaming games, but never was. Player messages, pvp and co-op is available, ranging from invasions to helpful players, and without it the game would have little replayability or retention value once completing it.It's pretty extensive as well as original. The DS mappers have always made amazing 3d environments that have unique architectures not generally seen elsewhere, which can make for a good playthrough even if you disable online mode.",1
Positive,"First and might be the last Souls game I play, but I am interested in playing the other games now I got so mad at this game that I literally broke my headphones in half and broke my controller cable when I slammed my controller on the ground.But it was all worth it in the endFinishing Dark Souls 3 felt like an accomplishment rather that me having an empty feeling when I finished a game that didnt challenge me.The game made me mad but a challenge was what I was looking for the whole time, because that feeling of overcoming something that was so against you released a surge of dopamine that felt so good I finally know what it means to praise the sun ( and the lord, since Im christian)You will die again and again and again and again, only to come back and evetually succeed.and then get your ass handed to you again once or 100 times more.Get this game? Only if youre a person whos into games with many mechanics to fidget with.I got introduced to this game through the Dragon Age games since the weapon upgrades were equally as important and survival depended on top notch management of your gear of you and your party. Be prepared to experiment as when something doesnt work youll have to be adaptable enough to use everything the game gives you at your disposal at that given moment.Most importantly, Dark Souls is not hard as long as you realize that you are suppose to fail to figure out what works and what doesnt. Once you get that through your head, youll have alot of fun actually instead of frustration.",1
Positive,"Amazing game, though I still have a soft spot for dark souls 1. Champion Gundyr best bossScrew you MidirI dont like that I have to kneel to a blondie for level up everytime smh.Game was 10x better screensharing to friends.If you like invading people in farron keep or catacombs and such you are EVIL :(I miss onion man already.",1

Positive,"Fun game.But!It has two major downsides that ruin the experience.Camera movement is just idiotic and is mostly the reason for ending up dead so often.And being dead so often is made worse by the stupid respawn method used by this game. Every time you die you are spawned near the bonfire, health is full but all enemies are back and you need to go all over the same trouble again, as many times as you die. And you tend to die a lot.So you end up spending too much time playing same battles and fighting same enemies. Gets frustrating and boring very quickly.",1
Positive,"Type: Single Player/Multiplayer Real-time Third Person Action RPG.+ Great level design, art direction and lore elements sprinkled throughout the world.+ Vast array of weapons and Armor to choose from, allowing for a wide range of playstyles.+ Challenging, but fair.+ Considerable variance in boss, enemy and character designs.+ An eerily grievous atmosphere.+ A bombastically fantastic soundtrack. + Infinitely replayable.+ Tight controls and faster combat than it's predecessors.- Poor camera controls if using a KBM setup.- Some RPG elements largely feel redundant compared to it's predecessors. - Some odd decisions concerning spell/miracle/pyromancy scaling.- Even to the adept, most of the bosses won't pose much of a challenge.- Netcode issues can lead to problems during online play.- Some areas feel incomplete/rushed.- Some environments feel a tad too familiar to each other.- Odd combat redesign choices by the devs (i.e. Poise, backstepping is literally useless, KEEP ROLLING ROLLING ROLLING etc)Get this if you enjoyed: DARK SOULS: Prepare To Die Edition; Nier: Automata; Hyper Light Drifter; The Witcher Series; Bloodborne; Lords of the Fallen.Far from a perfect game, Dark Souls III feels like what Dark Souls II should have been.

Positive,"Playing on PC, the game is extremely difficult for me, but starting to play it on my Steam Deck I began to swallow the game on the fly. I don't know why, but playing this game on this device is much better. I finally started playing games that I had long ago abandoned for whatever reason. The game is challenging and addictive at the same time. Difficult in terms of gameplay and some of the bosses, but addictive in its atmosphere",1
Positive,"One of the best games I've ever played, and one that taught me about perseverance and never stopping the fight. The atmosphere is nothing short of amazing, and the variety in the areas is amazing. The later areas in the game are incredibly diverse and beautiful, and this extends to the DLCs. The exploration is risky but rewarding and the hidden areas are concealing everything, from embers to bosses. Speaking of which, bosses are the highlight of this game. Hard, unforgiving but almost always fair. With the exception of very few, most of them are good, some are great and a handful are genuinely the most amazing fights I've had in a game. Tons of fun and frustration, very replayable especially if you respec and change your build and a weapon and armor to fit every taste. If you're not afraid of dying, respawning and fighting again, then the game is for you. May the flames guide thee!",1
Positive,"I initially had a hard time getting into the Dark Souls series, specifically when I tried the first game on PC. However, when my friends suggested we all play Dark Souls III together, I reluctantly agreed, and I'm so glad I did.Dark Souls III boasts gorgeous environments that create an immersive and atmospheric experience. The game's stunning visuals and art direction will leave you in awe as you traverse its diverse and detailed landscapes. Each boss encounter is uniquely designed and offers a challenging yet rewarding experience that pushes your skills to the limit.The game's tight controls make every movement feel responsive and precise, ensuring that you are in full command of your character. This precision is essential for navigating the game's unforgiving world and engaging in its intense combat encounters.Dark Souls III is a true masterpiece. If you've been hesitant to try the Dark Souls series, I highly recommend giving this third installment a chance you might just find yourself hooked!",1

Positive,"This game is actually amazing there are a few bosses in this game that will make you rip all your hair follicles out tho. Not b/c they are hard but rather very annoying I'm looking at you Midir. Those bosses luckily are very much so overshadowed by the amazing bosses, nearly all the lords of cinder are amazing fights most notable would be the Abyss watchers and the Lothric Princes both amazing fights sound track, play style, and visuals wise. A challenge but not so impossible you give up. So good they are memorable and will definitely stick out when someone ask me about this game. Another amazing yet sad thing about this game is the NPCs somehow these goofy guys who have 0 meaning to me in real life have so much emotion behind them especially Siegward I love my little onion boi. I played this game with a friend the whole way through and god was this a memorable and enjoyable experience. I would do anything to play this games main story for the first time with that person again tbh. Overall I know this is controversial and I know some losers are gonna throw a fit about this but I have enjoyed this game so much more than I did Elden Ring. The pvp on this game is more enjoyable, the map design is much less overwhelming keeping your want to play at a high, the visuals are on par with Elden Ring in every aspect, and the music is so much better. I definitely recommend this game for full price.",1

Positive,"Dark Souls 3 was my first experience with the series and I bought it this past December on the steam holiday sale, DLC included.I read a few user reviews and decided to finally give it a shot after hearing about it all these years. It didn't disappoint. The game provides a very deep sense of satisfaction for me, something I haven't experienced with video games in a very long time. Getting through a boss after hours of trying or reaching the next bonfire made me feel incredible. It reminds me of those old hard as hell platformers like Castlevania. The delay in attacking is reminiscent of the whip mechanics in Castlevania as well. I was also captivated by how depressingly beautifully the game itself was. The environments, the enemies, the bosses, the music, the story. It all just really clicked for me. It also did something many other video games haven't made me do, which is be extra considerate of my decisions. Don't get too greedy with attacking, know when to dodge/parry, read the enemy's movements carefully, etc. You can't just brute force your way through it. I consider playing the game a form of meditation. Gives me time to reflect on my life and the people I've met along the way.",1

Thank you Miyazaki for delivering a final farewell to an amazing trilogy. I know you didn't have a hand in DS2 but you incorporated some elements of that into this to really make it feel like a genuine part of the Dark Souls universe.

Positive,"I'm a huge fan of the Souls series, and I purchased this soon after its release but for one reason or another, I never bothered touching it until roughly a month ago.Dark Souls 3 was a bittersweet experience for me. As I journeyed through the world of Lothric, I noticed bits and pieces of the past (Lordran) scattered about and it filled me with a sense of overwhelming sadness. I saw things that were reminiscent of the first game or outright were from the first game, but dead and/or rotting. It made me want to back and play the first one again.Bar that fact, I feel that the PvP in this addition to the series was more solid than Ds2, but less appealing than Ds1 which I know many people will disagree with. Many things were tweaked or added/removed and it made PvP a bit too simplistic for me although I still partook in it a bit and still do, (I rotate between this and DsR now). The stories of all the games and piecing them together through item descriptions and lore always enthralled me and still does to this day. The world of Souls remains to be one of the most mysterious i've come across with all of the games i've played. Overall, with graphic presentation, gameplay and story in mind, I give Ds3 an 8.5/10.",1

Positive,"Enemies stagger you a lot easier than you can stagger them now, it's not exactly as good when it comes to variety in builds as DS1 and DS2,and it has somewhat less satisfying PvP. However, DS3 improves nearly every other aspect. Great graphics, decent matchmaking system and good perfomance. It's also officially supported by Valve on Linux, through Steam Play, though I have yet to try that.",1
Positive,"Don't you ever just love a game so much that you hate it? Well, look like DarkSouls3 is the game for you. Wield giant ass swords to kill outrageous sized bosses as you journey on your way to link the fire. Or maybe you don't want to link the fire and just be surrounded by darkness. Your choice.

Positive,"This game is challenging, but not hard or impossible.I highly recommend this game and its season pass. (Do not buy the ashes DLC alone its not worth it)The boss fights are thrilling and can really test your patience once you start having trouble with a boss.If you plan on playing this game without a controller or just for the online play I'd highly reconsider purchasing this game.When I played through DS3 I didn't have many issues with the game besides Online Servers dying for no reason and the game crashing for no reason I can find be these were rare. If I had to rate this game I'd rate it a 8/10 with a controller and a 6/10 without one",1
Positive,"Are you ready to die? Dark Souls III is a tough as nails game that will test your mettle with its terrifying bosses and nasty jaunts between bonfires. The gameplay is a lot more refined than first game; parrying and pyromancy aren't as broken and require far more skill than Dark Souls 1. If you have played DS 1, you'll notice quite a few more bonfires here than in that game. For many, this'll be a bit of a turn off, but rest assured that much of the first game's difficulty is still intact. As a sequel to dark souls, dark souls iii far outshines ii and is a fitting conclusion to the beloved trilogy.",1

Positive,"A wonderfully, well-made game. Aside from it being Dark Souls, it's also full of fashion to play dress-up, which we know is very important in our video games.Killing a Lord of Cinder while wearing a white fluffy dress with no defensive stats? Yes. This is how games should be.",1
Positive,"TLDR: I am very happy with this game's story and mechanics. Plus it was a good way to rap up the series that is Dark Souls.What can I say, other than it is everything you would expect from previous Souls games with a slight hint of ""casual"" flair throw in to appeal to a brouder player base. Of course, this doesn't mean it doesn't have its share of up-ticks in dificulty to still try your patience and see if your really a determined Souls player at the core of your being.Standout parts from the rest of the series:- Best search mechanics to help you play with your friends- Coolest concept with combining Demon's hub area w/ Dark's open world mechanics- Probably the best upgrade mechanics for weapons in the entire series- DLC not for the faint of heart but doesn't drain your soul like II's did",1
Positive,"after 2 full years the game still has a game breaking bug where the hitboxes do not move from their spawn points, do not buy this game until the devs get off their lazy ass and actually fix the bug that so many people are having.EDIT: after having to change my cpu and motehrboard i finally managed to get the game to boot up, only to be met with a white screen, after several hours i fixed it, aaaaaand i met another issue. my character wouldnt move at all, after yet again several hours i got the game to work.i will now give a proper review based on the working gamethe game is about as fair as pitting a lord of cinder against a crippled downy, enemies have infinite stamina infinite sprint, can combo endlessly, enemies have 10x more health than you and kill you in two hits. is the game unfair as fuck? yes, yes it is, however it is beatable, it sure is satisfying to kill the fucker cucker that killed you 50+ times becuase he used an un-telegraphed attack and insta killed you (yes im talking about you oceiros you asswipe) .the gmae is also much MUCH easier and more fun if youre playing with a friend, until you cmplete the boss in that area then you cant summon them in that area anymore.the game is riddled with bugs and hackers, as usual the makers of the game give as many shits about fixing the pc game as i give shits about offending people, absolutely fucking none.if you like a challenging game (a game where your attacks are literal wet wank tissues) and can overlook the major flaws mainly stemming from the devs refusing to fix the game and hackers then youll have a good time (aka youll get your ""dark sign"" ""pillaged"" by everyone).",1
Positive,"TLDR; Depending on what you come to Dark Souls for, you'll either love it or hate it. If you come for amazing storytelling and tight combat, you've come for the right place. If you come for competitive PVP and Castlevania exploration, DS1 or 2 is probably better for you.Pros:Fastest, most responsive combat. The delay between button press and action is significantly lower than previous games, making combat intense and rewarding. Strategy is still required though, as enemy attack patterns will punish button mashers. Simply put, the meat of the game is really, really fun and doesn't gets boring.Best art direction of the Souls series. Everything from enviroments to bosses has fantastic detail and consistent design motiffs. It feels like a real, living world, and has none of the jarring, inorganic art direction of DS2. This has the added bonus that you're always able to tell where you should be going next.Hidetaka Miyazaki's storytelling is on point like never before. If you care about the story outside of the player's actions, this game has it in spades. More than any other Souls game, the mechanics and themes complement each other with elegance and precision.Joining and leaving covenants is so much easier now. Instead of having to meet with the leader of a covenant everytime you want to join or leave there's now an equipable item. Completing covenant quests can be rough though, as there's almost no one playing anymore.Cons:Pvp isn't the highlight of the series. It's fun if you're not heavily invested, but I know for more serious pvp players there are some major concerns. It's still decent enough that I find myself booting DS3 back up just for invasions though.Servers are kind of dead. Seriously, the only time I'll run into other people is on weekend nights.Very restricting about how to proceed for the first 15 hours. Even after that, there's only really 3 paths to take. Because of this, the game is quite a bit shorter than previous dark souls games. My first run through only took about 50 hours to beat.The Dark Souls series does very little to protect against cheaters, this one is no different. Not as rampant or as frustrating as in 1, but you will encounter them.Maps aren't as sprawling or open as 1. This isn't as big of a deal as it sounds like though, because the encounters throughout the world are very well spaced and timed, and you don't feel like you're being railroaded into playing the game a certain way.",1
Positive,9/10 too many people using Estus during duels,1
Positive,"I will preface this review by stating that I would undoubtedly recommend Dark Souls III to anyone who is even considering purchasing the game. I initially had bought this game only because it was on sale and the dark fantasy intrigued me. I went into this game knowing next to nothing about the Souls series of games, besides the reputation it has for it's unforgiving nature. Needless to say, I was thrown into this game head first.My initial thoughts of the game were fairly neutral. Most of my time in the first area was spent trying to ensure that I was progressing along the path intended by the developers. The map seemed a bit too open to the point where I would doubt if I was even going in the right direction, however, this was one of the first RPGs I had played in a while, so I could have just been overly cautious. Despite this I had made my way to the first boss, and after many deaths I finally killed it. The feeling of accomplishment I felt then is one that I still feel to this day whenever I down a boss. At the time it also felt reassuring; I was actually progressing.There are many aspects that helped make Dark Souls III a memorable experience to me. The game play itself without a doubt is unforgiving, but it never feels unfair. If you get hit by a boss, you timed your roll wrong; if you get jumped by a group of enemies, you should have played more cautious and defensive. The story itself is pretty hidden, but your short term goals and objectives are always clear. If you put in the time and look in the right places though, the game rewards you with more lore and story. All of the NPCs you meet through the story are memorable and unique. Completing their individual stories presents you with everything about them, from their motives to their personalities. On top of the elements I mentioned before, the environment is outstanding throughout the game. This is mostly accomplished through the music and the breathtaking backgrounds.My last reason for recommending this game is because of it's replay value. After sinking hundreds of hours into this game, getting every achievement, and completing the DLCs, I still find myself coming back to this game. Whether it's to try a new build or weapon in the PvE content, or just playing PvP for fun, I still get enjoyment out of this game. If you are on the fence about buying this game because it's on sale, you like RPGs, or even just because the dark fantasy genre intrigues you, I would without a doubt recommend this game. I bought this game impulsively, not knowing what to expect, and it ended up turning into one of my most memorable game experiences. Dark Souls III is one of my favorite games of all time.",1

Positive,"like this game, hope for more of these games.",1
Positive,"The game itself is graphically impressive and seeing as the past 2 games had great mechanics it was simply all poured together to provide a great experience; I truly loved it and what drove me to play it was the simply satisfaction of exploring and memorizing every key aspect of the game which is something I would never think of doing; providing multiple runs of the game and all out enjoyment. However with that being said I most likely wouldn't have been as inspired to beat it without the simplicity of multiplayer. It's one thing to roam these treacherous lore filled and despair-filled lands but with a friend humor simply pours into this odd mix to serve as some sort of medium of all things in this relation; and at that the game itself can prove semi-difficult without someone to aid you. Overall, though in any audience this works out perfectly due to a sunmmoning system present in previous games; along with the large playerbase as of now that provide that helping hand oyu may need throughout the game; but in all this game is simply driving and something I haven't experienced in awhile. I'd definetely reccomend it for it's complexity and understanding of itself overtime proving itself to be worth every bit of money poured into it. Coming from the second game I can understand why people would take the first game over any other ""souls-like"" game yet it simple just adds onto the flavor of this series and partially makes it what it is all binding together in odd relation and being a series that I can't easily depart from after deeply putting my trust, effort, and time into it.",1

Positive,"This game is easily the best game of 2016. It is a great ending to the souls series. Dark Souls 3 is my first souls game. From what I've heard it is the hardest. After 4 playthroughs, I think I have played enough of the game to give a good review. ( I have not yet played any of the DLC). I am going to be revealing minor spoilers so be wary. Lets start with a list of the features I liked and disliked.+Difficulty LevelThis is the first game that I have ever played that really challenged me. My first playthrough was basically an abusive relationship. The game would hit me, I would cry about it and quit, but eventually came back to it after an hour. The first few areas had me thinking, ""This isn't so bad"". Then came the Abyss Watchers my favorite boss in the game. Holy shit that was a hard fight for me. And that is my favorite thing about this game. The fact that is excrutiatingly difficult. +MusicI am a sucker for instrumental music, and this game extremly delivered. Walking into my first Gundyr fight, when the music kicked in, it was a moment that I would remember for a long time. When I was fighting the Abyss Watchers, and they combined together to put up one last fight, the violin solo made me feel pity for the curse of the Watchers. The music is really amazing in this game.+/- Level DesignThe level design for this game is really unique, and it really does not hold your hand. It is highly possible for you to miss entire areas of the game, and exploration is key. I do not know how I feel about this. I like the style the game is going for, but it sometimes is annoying to miss an item. The side quest are somewhat hidden, and it is best to double back on an area to make sure you did not miss something. On my first playthrough of the game, I missed a lot of the items, and ended up looking up some of the locations. Having to do that took some fun out of the game, and it was annoying. The world it self is highly detailed and looks amazing. The locations do make the game world seem a little small though.+/- StoryIt is possible to play through this game and not know anything about the story, other than you have to keep a fire from going out. It is sad that the game does not tell you more, because the story for the game is really intresting. Most of the story is hidden in item descriptions, and vague npc dialouge. I would suggest looking up a video explaining the lore for the game if you plan on playing it, though be wary of spoilers.+/- Enemies and BossesThe games Enemies and Bosses are pretty unique. Each area has a specific set of enemies that the player has to learn to defeat. They are designed well. The Bosses are really awesome. In the begining cutscence, the Lord of Cinder are displayed as these unique and badass super people who you have to kill. Almost all of their fights are challenging (ahem Yhorm) and are entertaining. I wish there was a feature that allowed you to fight the bosses again individually, but the closest thing we get is a new game plus system. I played a playthrough of new game plus on my strength build, and it was a joke. Having end game gear against enemies who are slightly buffed makes the game downright easy. It may just be easier with a strength build, but I would stay away from it.+/- Weapon and Estus SystemThe game changed the system which Estus flask and weapon upgrading works. For Estus, you find shards which can grant you additional flask, and undead bone shards, which make your Estus heal more health. I really like this system. Your Estus flask sort of ""level"" with you. I like the weapon upgrading system. I like how there is different types of titanite for boos weapons and normal weapons, and also how you have to devote a titanite slab to get a weapon to +10, which there are only 8 of in the game. My only gripe with the weapons are the weapon arts. I think they are a cool way to make every weapon feel unique, but some weapons have seriously underpowered weapon arts.Meh -The Invasion systemThe pvp in this game is okay. I personally found that it was an annoyance to be invaded while clearing areas that are hard enough without another player making things more difficult. Though it was really entertaining to be right at the bonfire and then a deadly duo including Aberdolf Lincler ruins your day. I do like the summon system. I used it to help other players defeat bosses that I really liked to play against and that they might be having a hard time with. I have really enjoyed this game, and I feel that it has ended the series in the best way it could. It gave intresting enemies and bosses, beautiful levels, an intriguing but somewhat hidden story, and a good weapon and estus sytstem. I would highly reccommend getting this game, as it will be well worth your $60.",1
Positive,"I used to not be a fan of the souls series, I tried to play each of them starting with DS1 and ending with Bloodborne, and each and every time I just got mad and gave up. Then Dark Souls 3 went on sale and a friend wanted me to get it so we could play together, so I caved and bought it only expecting to play maybe 1-2 hours of it and then return it. Things did not turn out that way though, I fell in love with this game, and only a week later and I have put 30 hours into it, if you look at my other games you'll see how much that really is for me. To be honest, I was in a bit of a slump as there were no games that really caught my interest (at least since Fallout 4) I would just buy a game, play maybe 5-9 hours and lose any desire to continue playing. I love the complicated lore, the amazing scenery, and above all else, the overwhelming challenge. I named my character Hugh Janus, made him an obese black man, and a face esembling a cows clitorus, and off I went on one hell of a journey. I think I may go back and replay the other games in the series, only after I am done with this one, because I have to say it has quickly become one of the best games I have ever played. I know how it feels to be scared off by the reputation these games have earned, and you will want to give up at times, but if you just power through and see what waits after that boss, you'll want to do the same for the one after that, and the one after that, and so on. If you ever feel like you can't do it, just do what I do and think, I've made it this far, might as well keep going.",1

I have beat New Game in a little over 30 hours. Yet, there is so much more to this game. There is all of the weapons and armor to collect. Sadly you can't upgrade armor like the other games in the DARK SOULS series. I digress, there are many ways you can allocate your points to give a certain ""build"". With every DARK SOULS game it is rich with backstory and lore. DARK SOULS III has references from other DARK SOULS games. PVP is a large option in DARK SOULS III but it's not required.

Positive,"As many From Software games, Dark Souls III respects the player and doesnt hold your hand throughout the entire expereince. It's a changelling game with a much rewarding gameplay. I would not recommend to gamers that dont enjoy a struggle now and then. This is not a game for the faint of heart, but once you understand the mechanics and lore behind it all, it is a very enjoyable and thoroughly satisfying game",1
Positive,"Dark Souls III is a tough one (no pun intended). After the mess Dark Souls II was, this is a strong send-off to the series, and by all means a great game. But as I was playing it I noticed there was something different, something Dark Souls had that this didn't. I think than problem comes from familiarity. When I first played Dark Souls I was new to the series, everything in that world was unknown to me, and that's when the Souls series is at its best. When it catches you off guard, when you don't know how the enemies will react, when it makes you think in ways most games just don't.Dark Souls III just doesn't deliver that for people who played the previous titles. From Software played it too safe, and it shows. The game doesn't surprise you in the way Dark Souls did, enemies are too familiar, some of them reused from previous titles. Traps you might find around the map are also predictable. Even art direction in some areas is brought back from past work for the sake of ""fan service"".I also don't like the direction From Software is taking in bosses and some combat encounters. Making you fight against 2, 3, 4 or more opponents at once without a chance of taking them out one by one feels unfair, and you can tell some bosses are clearly designed to be played in co-op. As someone who likes to beat the game by himself this is definitely a step back as I don't get the chance of a fair fight against my opponents. It also is a really cheap way of making the game more ""difficult"" for the people asking for tougher encounters. This is not the way to go and I think From can do better.If you are a fan of the series and just want more of the Dark Souls we already know, you'll love this game. Overall this is a great title, but for the ones who are looking for a new experience it looks like we are going to have to wait for a bit longer.",1

Positive,"I'll whine a little and then recommend it:-The Bloodborneish enemies hit faster than you, they move while starting the attack, they move while ending the attack. They have homing charging attacks that might or might not do damage only at the end of the charge, or throughout the animation, it's a guessing game per enemy. All the while you're stuck with slow weapons, without poise, with shields that usually just slow your next swing and eat your stamina. How they ""fixed"" it is that dodge rolling costs barely any stamina.-All kinds of weapon infusions, yay right? Nope. Many coals needed for infusions are very late game and there might only be one infusion material till the very end of the game. Yes, including grinding. Oh yeah and other upgrade materials open up way late too, because f uck you.-There's maybe 2-3 weapons per category that are actually viable. Not ""pvp"" viable. ""Viable"" viable. Some of them need several bosses cleared. And yes, lance is again at the very end, vanilla dark souls 2 style.-To be a caster, you have to be dedicated to it, making you a one-trick pony. Mana estus takes away healing estus. Stat requirement for decent miracle damage is 50+. And you can't just tank through it because:-Heavy armors suck ass, no matter what kind of tweaking they make, since it only matters for pvp.-HP stat cap is 27. It does go higher than that, but does nothing.Ignoring all that it's enjoyable, IF you make a spammy light attack build (I suggest twinblades), IF you use medium armor, and IF you wiki where the stoneplate rings (the real armor) are.

Positive,"First things first: - The vast majority of people complaining about technical issue, are people that upgraded from W7 to W10. Not that should be wrong, but it's known that's a lot of problem about W10 overlay when you upgrade from 7. Believe me, I was one of this guys complaining about crash, low frame rate at some point, etc. Even with the ""fix"" ( reduce lightning to low ) I still had some problem with frame rate ( dropping to 10fps at times ). The true fix was tweak the nvidia control panel settings and change priority from Quality to Performance, and solved the problem, in another games as well.That being said, now about Dark Souls 3.It's IMPOSSIBLE to get the same vibe, feelings from Dark Souls, but still a very good Souls game, much better than 2.Graphic wise, DS3 uses Bloodborne engine, so you cannot expect graphics par games like The Witcher 3 for instance, but it's a really good looking game, the background, the vistas from a far is truly gorgeous. Irithyll anyone?The gameplay is a mix with ALL Souls series and the new touch with weapon skill was very well realized, but the game still have a lot to offer to casual and hardcore player, but this time with much more multiplayer content, even more than SOTFS, and this is a good thing. Even being possible to set a password and play with your friend only if you will.The art and lvl design try to catch too much from DS1, looks like an attempt to repair the damage caused from DS2, but still fun to see Anor Londo once again and a lot of references from DS1.DS3 is a MUST BUY if you are a Soul fan, and chances are that you already purchased the game if you are fan. BUT, if you're new to the series, buy Prepare to Die Edition.",1
Positive,"This review is my opinion of dark souls 3 written after killing every boss and finishing my first playthrough. Warning: long review, non-native English speaker, mostly praise. While dark souls 1 is my favorite game of all time, dark souls 3 can easily be my top 4 games of all time alone, despite my love towards the franchise. It s sad to see that dark souls 3 is the last game for its series, but I look forward to play its DLC and more awesome games made by From software.Boss fights: there are about 20 bosses in total in dark souls 3. All of them are not easy and require a lot of death to figure out the right strategies. The satisfying feeling that I get after mastering the mechanic after countless death and finally beating the bosses is what makes these fights great. Every boss fight has its unique theme, music, and they all have different phrases when the bosses become more powerful. About half of the boss fights are designed really well that are really memorable. Several boss fights have reached the level of epicness that I have never experienced in any other games. Theme/graphic/music: the world of dark souls 3 is dark and beautiful. The world is full of details: different designs for the thrones of lords that match their lore, cells that are full of decayed bodies but still tell stories of their prisoners through furniture and items, areas leading to bosses and boss rooms that amplified the power of different bosses The world is as pretty as some other games like the witcher 3 and farcry, but the music is better in my opinion. The music for different areas and boss fights are so in tone with the game that makes me even want to go back to fight the bosses again after so many death and finally beating them. Bosses may be strong, but they are not as strong as the tones created by the piano and violin in those music. Interconnected world: dark souls 1 has most of its worlds interconnected to each other. This level of world design has never been reached by another game for so many years after the game came out. While dark souls 3 has not reached the same level, it is obvious throughout the game that the developer tried to make maps interconnected. As a result, there are a lot of shortcuts that connect different sections of the same area or different areas that would not normally connect to each other. Finding those shortcuts enriches the experience of exploring the world.Weapons/armors: while weapons and armors are similar to DS1 &2, 2 important changes are made. 1. Each weapon now has a special attack that used mana to cast. This makes weapons more unique, and it would have greater impact on PVP than PVE. 2. Weapons can be upgraded, but armors and shields can no longer be leveled up. This greatly reduces the defense of mid-late game characters. Leveling up defense items and tank a lot of hits is no long an options in DS3. This change makes mid-late game PVE more challenging, and it can create a lot of build varieties in PVP. I think people call this the return of the fashion soul. Lore: while the witch 3 has the best lore and storytelling among all the games, souls game focus on actions, and DS3 chooses the right approach to tell its story. The game doesn t tell its story directly. The player needs to learn about the story through hints around the world. It s easy to miss the details of the story if not paying attention to item descriptions and connecting the dots between dialogs of NPCs. To me, this is the prefect approach: the action of the game is good enough, and if the player wants to learn more about the lore, it is free to do so, and there are plenty to learn. The story of dark souls is simple yet complicated, and dark souls 3 finally completes the cycle of the whole story. The faiths of god, fire, humanity, and undead are all depend on the choice of the player.Return of the old elements from pervious souls games: several areas of the game and characters have returned from pervious souls games to dark souls 3. This is truly amazing for a souls fan. Combat/difficulty: combat is faster than pervious souls games and more punishing. Weaker defense and spells make it hard to tank a lot of hits or stay in safe distance to spam magic. Again, dark souls focus on actions, and there is simply no better games in the market so far in term of action/movement of the character. While I wishes some bosses have more HP and leave less open windows for the player to attack, the hard ones are hard enough. The first boss(tutorial boss) is actually challenging for me: a not-so-noob player, and it really showcases the principle of this game: dodging and timing. Dying a lot and losing all the hard earned souls is mandatary, but that is how a soul game should be played. Co-op: while I didn t choose to co-op for any of my game progression, co-op and invade are easy and fun. I did tried some PVP, and it seems there are very few pure casters since spells are much weaker in DS3 comparing to DS1 and 2. People use spells mostly for buffs. In short, dark souls 3 worth its full price, and it s definitely one of the best games I ve ever played. I tried to explore the world as much as I can during my first playthrough, and I m sad it only last for around 60 hours. It was such a good time for every single minute I spent on this game. I d definitely suggest anyone to play this game. Also, try to play the game with minimum guides/coop for progression during the first playthrough. It will make the experience much better.",1
Positive,This game is amazing and really deserved all the awards that it achieved. Sad that it is going to be the last of the the souls series. I Purchased the deluxe edition with the steam controller and am really happy to say that the controller works really well. would have been cool if the controller came with a dark souls deluxe edition skin on it.,1
Positive,"Within nearly two weeks I've almost clocked in the same hours in Dark Souls 3 than I have in Dark souls 2 Scholar of the first Sin. Don't get me wrong, it's an excellent game, but I got to the final boss and beat it in six days, less than a week! And that's after I grinded for 30 sunlight medals and leveled up my character. Granted that I missed an area or two when there was a fork in the road, but considering that it was optional and I got to the final boss and beat it with little to no difficulty, I was somewhat disappointed. It may be because I've played the others that I'm used to the difficulty, but some things have been gradually scaled back compared to the other games. For example, if you get poisoned, you'll barely notice it happened, it's only the two times where toxic comes into play that you will worry. My other gripe about this game is that it feels like a re-hash of Dark Souls one because of how similar things are.Regardless, there's still many new areas to explore, more fluent and stylish fighting, and plenty of time to GIT GUD.If you have ever played a souls game before, continue on with the series and play this, and if you're new to the story it's also a good place to start.",1
Positive,"Note: Basically requires a controller. I personally reccomend an Xbox One controller. I have a steam controller but I just dont really like it.Game is visually stunning, and grabs your attention right off the bat and keeps you playing. Whether it be for exploring every nook and cranny in an area, to figuring out how to beat that boss that you keep dying to, this game has a lot of content. Definately worth the money. There are stories and people saying they were banned for using controller mappers / hackers invading their game and corrupting their save files. This has not happened to me yet, hopefully it doesnt but I cannot say my opinion on this matter. It would certainly be a waste of time for this to happen and would certainly make me stop playing for a while.",1
Positive,Dank Souls 3for every death smoke one bowlget gud or get baked,1
Positive,"This is an excellent game, but don't get me wrong, it's not at all easy. This game is about challenge, and what really makes it great is the way you fight. Getting hit is actually whatever it might be actually hitting your character. It's not like some RPGs where you press a button and it says 40 damage to other player. A spell, arrow, bolt (crossbow), or sword all alike will need to physically hit your character. This is where the real fun comes in.Do you dodge? Hold up your shield? Try to hit first? Maybe you can even time a Parry, then hit the other guy for a lot of damage.It is HARD, it is unforgiving, but it's not impossible. It's challenging, and it's worth it.Nevermind the awesome atmosphere, the variety of monsters, the different challenges as you go on. If you haven't played earlier in the series, I recommend starting Dark Souls: Prepare to die Edition, and don't forget to get DSFIX to fix some visual issues with that game.",1
Positive,"Alright then, with the issues mostly smoothed out I can give this game a reccomendation. The game doesnt crash for me anymore, and runs pretty well-a far sight from launch week. Dark Souls 3 looks pretty good, runs at 60 FPS, and while there are bugs here and there as well as visual ticks for the most part everything is fine. The PC settings are solid, and the game looks gorgeous-unlike DS2 it feels huge and connected, with lots of attention to detail in addtion to the pretty graphics. Covenants are easier to swap between allowing more experimentation, the design is top notch and the music is some of the best in the series in my opinion. I went into this game not expecting all that much more than DS2, and as of right now its a contendor for favorite of the series going against Dark souls. If you were burned by Dark souls 2 I can say this game is far better than that one and its worth the dive. If you have only played 1 and are considering trying 2 first, I would reccomend just skipping over it-theres little relation between the games and I think this one is far more worth your time. So far I've been having a great time with it and I would wholeheartedly reccomend it to anyone looking for another souls game.",1

The story and atmosphere is 10/10, and the music perfectly complements each boss fight from grand epic choirs that make you feel like a badass to more somber movements that seem to root actively against the player and mourn the dying boss.

Positive,"Even at (most) times the game is challenging to point of frustration, DS3 is extremely rewarding. I've enjoyed it on every playthrough.Most of all, I enjoy the challenging aspect of the game.Character building and item variety is interesting, This offers many ways to progress through the game.Even if the DS world is dark and gloomy, it is really pretty.Two cons I do have:- the story is not told in traditional manner. Instead of direct narrative approach, story is more presented in flavor texts, and with the state of your surroundings. The story is still really confusing to me. - the game is not too enjoyable to backseat. Especially if the spectator has no experience with the game. This games from the fact that you will run same corridors over and over again, to give another try to a bossThis game most likely will frustrate you, but does offer rewarding feeling of mastery. Hopefully you have the patience to see the game through :)",1
Positive,"Disclaimer: I have not played the other titles in the series, so for fans of Dark Souls, I cannot compare. I also had no interest in the PvP aspect, although fighting invading players with a buddy was a fun random event.That said, this is easily one of my favorite games. The challenge of combat coupled with the risk of death made exploring the intricately crafted levels an incredibly rewarding experience that rivals the Elder Scrolls titles. The versatility of the in-game currency's uses makes defeating enemies and looting the world feel satisfying. Items and equipment almost always come with delightful tidbits of lore, and each new enemy or zone brings new weapons and armor to upgrade your character in meaningful ways, beyond simple stat boosts.That was another thing that stood out to me about Dark Souls: the upgrade system helps keep your weapons viable against the progressively tougher enemies you encounter as you move through the game. My favorite weapons to play with were the flashy and aggressive twinswords you can get at the start of the game - while I did experiment with dozens of other weapons (from rapiers and classic sword-and-shield, to more exotic fare like claws or whips), I always came back to my trusty starter weapons. Because skill/practice was often more important than the stats, I also found more freedom in customizing my character's appearance. I wasn't limited to the ""best"" items, and could play the game comfortably with items I liked for visual appeal.It's probably stupid of me to wait this long to mention combat, but it be like that sometimes. Combat is the center of Dark Souls gameplay, and there's very little you're going to be doing outside of fighting enemies, save perhaps walking around in a place recently cleared of enemies. Dark Souls is probably best known for its difficulty, and I've definitely felt my share of frustration. Having friends come in to join the game alleviates this significantly, though if both players are encountering a boss for the first time, it can still be pretty grueling. The diversity of enemies and combat techniques, as well as the high skill ceiling, made it a fun system to engage with over and over. It feels really, really good to master combat. Re-exploring familiar turf likely still brings its challenges, but the diminished threat of familiar enemies makes you feel like you're becoming a stronger character on your own merit rather than the strength of your stats.Lastly, I have to mention the aesthetic of this game. The bleak, somber, and [obviously] dark nature of the world and its characters was an instant draw to me. Everybody - and everything - you meet is either undead or a demon, something I'd never seen done before. Dark Souls' take on undeath hit home better than any other IP I'd seen (looking at you, Warcraft). Everywhere you turn, the setting reminds you that this is a world that has stagnated for a long, long time. I loved that.I could go on. I really could. It's an excellent game. I wish more games shared some of Dark Souls' less-celebrated qualities of worldbuilding, equipment, exploration, and replayability.",1
Positive,This game is good,1
Positive,The pacing of this game is pretty damn exceptional. Extremely fun game.,1
Positive,"Dark Souls III - the latest and last in the Dark Souls franchise, and oh boy is it worth it.Dark Souls III, compared to its predecessors, is a fast-paced third person RPG revolving around one goal - to defeat the Lords of Cinder and return them to Firelink Shrine, in the name of Linking the First Flame. While lacking a ""polished"" tutorial, Dark Souls III is designed so that you learn through two things - fighting and dying. Be it to a common Hollow or to a machete-wielding giant, death is the greatest teacher in this game. So, prepare to die - a lot.While more linear than the first two games, Dark Souls III makes up for this with a fleshed-out story; provided you seek it out. The game won't hold your hand during your adventure, so it will not do so for the story - beyond what cutscenes and dialogue there are. The majority of the game's lore can be found through item descriptions and various NPC questlines (some better designed than others). Combat is probably at its best in the series - with the introduction of Weapon Arts, new life has been given to weapons otherwise defined by their moveset. Some may be pleased to know that Poise is no longer the juggernaut it once was, and only applies in PvP. Instead, Hyper Armor frames - which provide an immunity to stagger during some heavier weapon attacks - have replaced the standard ""poise-to-win"" meta that drove the original Dark Souls.My only complaints - the removal of the Blue Eye Orb, password summons beyond maximum area level range, and the gutting of Covenants.Removing the Blue Eye Orb was a bad decision on From Software's part. Rather than the original intention of the Blades of the Darkmoon and Blue Sentinels Covenants - to appear in the worlds of invaders as avengers - these two ""protector"" covenants have been reduced to automatically summoned phantoms to kill invaders. This only occurs if the Host has the Way of Blue Covenant equipped. This has made the grind severely more reliant on the connection to a Host, and is not on-demand vengeance for an invader who has killed a host.Password summons, while good for uninterrupted co-op, have derailed the PvP scene at any Soul Level lower than 145. Gank squads consisting of a host and over-leveled phantoms are commonplace. Despite the downscaling applied to phantoms, it is not enough to give a solo invader the upper hand in PvP. This feature should have been restricted to summoning players only within the level range of the current area (as non-passworded summons function).Rewards for completing the grinds (and they are grinds) for the various Invader covenants are lackluster at best, and some Covenants are either quickly replaced (Blue Sentinels with Blades of the Darkmoon) or share turn-in items with covenant-less invaders (Dark Spirits as opposed to Rosaria's Fingers). There is only a single co-op covenant - Warriors of Sunlight - and the other covenant that can participate in co-op is made up of wildcard players called Mound-Makers - those equally willing and able to kill you as well as help you to the boss. Altogether, Covenants are worth it for completionists, but those just wishing to finish the game can safely ignore them.I'd give the base game an 8/10. If you can get past the initial lack of explanation, try new things, and read descriptions, Dark Souls III is a game for you. As for the DLCs - they are incredibly worth it, offering access to PvP Arenas (unlocked through a drop in Ashes of Ariandel or by completing a NPC questline in the Ringed City), new weapons, and delivering a solid finish to the Dark Souls series' story as a whole. Don't buy the Ringed City on its own - Ashes of Ariandel's story is vital to understanding the Ringed City.Overall Rating: 8.5/10.",1

Positive,Very nice casual fun.,1
Positive,"The first time I got this game, it was too strong for my computer, even on the lowest settings. I later found out I did not have enough VRAM, which, if you dont know, means basically I was crashing fairly quickly, every time I opened Dark Souls 3. Two things kept me around; The very common autosave, which meant everything I did was saved save for maybe a fight or two, and just how good this game is. I spent my first 150 hours just *suffering*, crashing every 10 minutes, sometimes right after bossfights, fast enough that I lost all the progress. I got discouraged, but just how much I love Dark Souls, in particular 3, made me come back. Another 10 minutes. Get just a bit farther. I hit a wall block around 3/4th through the game, and wanted to scream. That boss made me want to crack my eyeballs open. But thats the thing. No matter how much he infuriated me, it only determined me to get farther. Few bosses will flat out destroy you before phase 2, meaning you will almost always at least get halfway, before dying. It always says ""you got this far, do it twice!"". Some bosses just seem unbeatable, and then you pull through, and destroy them. I havent even played Dark Souls 1, and I love this. I did play DS2 and Bloodborne, didnt get very far in either, and I am glad I knew beforehand DS2 is a black sheep among the souls games, so I knew the others werent as. . .floaty. Everything has lore. I have only played Dark Souls 3, and even by extension, I have learned a ton of lore. This might be because there is a massive amount of nods to DS1. DS2 is a bit kicked to the side, but it has a few nods here and there.For me, Dark Souls 3 is a masterpiece. It has its flaws. But thats the important aspect of games. If a game has a lot of flaws, the rest of the game had better be good as hell to make up for it.I had a friend that quit because of how much shit this game throws at you, and all the hidden stuff the game will never flat out say. The only reason I might have stayed this long is because before I went in I read up on a lot of stuff. I found out what makes most people quit before I went in, and this probably lowered the whole shock of everything for me. All I can say in regards to the rating? 8.5/10. Its a great game, and I think anyone should give it a try. More of a try than most games, for just how hard and unforgiving this game can be. If you can push through, what remains is a fantastic piece of work.",1

Positive,Fantastic Game! great story and great challenge all the way!,1
Positive,"Dark Souls 3 is now one of my top RPGs of all time. It can be quite difficult at times but to be honest it is fair as long as you can learn from your mistakes. I loved Dark Souls 1 but this is a even better game. The feeling you get as you level up and defeat each boss is exilerating. There is nothing like it. The fighting feels nice and each hit is amazing. The lore behind the game is deep and interesting but very hidden. Even after finshing the game and playing new game plus about 5 times, I still want to keep coming back for more. This is a must play for RPG fans that are looking for a new challenge or just a new RPG to get into. If you're looking to get into the Souls games this is a great place to start as it is a bit easier than the first game and it is a much better game in the long run. 9/10 before DLC, 10/10 with DLC.",1
Positive,"so i have finished the game together with all dlcs and i have one thing to say, i am hoocked. this game was kinda my life for a week or two. now i am preparing to go into ng+-for mouse and keyboard users such as myself, this game shouldn't pose a challenge. it is easy to get the hang of the controls and i found no need to make any changes myself-now this game is the type of easy to learn, hard to master. the basic controls are easy to learn, but throughout the game new little mechanics will pop up, helping or hindering you against new foes.-speaking of which, the enemies in this game are amazing. each area has new enemies with different attacks, making memorising attack patterns a must. of course there are exceptions, like rats been in every sewer like area and some ram like creature been in 2 areas (can someone pls eplain why they are in such different enviroments?)-there are many weapons and armor sets you can collect. but armor is pretty useless in this game, at least that is what many people and i have discovered. just put on the armor that makes you look the most badass. all weapons have a special move that vary from healing to defense to damage and buffs. (i am not including magic because i have yet to actually make such a character)-the multiplayer of this game can be a real upgrade to the game or a real downside. there are 2 gamemodes (3 if you own any of the two dlc). there is the friendly phantom, which is used for players that want help with a boss or area in general and there is pvp, which is self explenatory. now there is a feature called invasion, which is when a red phantom (the pvp guy) invades your world. they will try to kill you. note that invasions happen only when you are embered, something that you will find out in the game. point is, you are safe as long as you not embered.-there are also covenants. these can either act as ways to assist the player (with bosses or against invaders) or they are pvp covenants, which is where you are summoned to another world as an invader to kill the ""tresspasser"" of an area. doing these covenant ""duties"" rewards you with ites and spells. please note that the following covenants, some of which are pvp and others co-op take quite a while for you to be summoned to various reason. the covenants watchdogs of farron, darkmoon blades and blue sentinels.-bosses are all very nicely designed and all have their own unique patterns and fighting styles. where as others might be slow but strong, others can be fast and nimble, but still strong as all hell.-now the thing that casuals like me are waiting for in this review. is the game hard? yes, yes it is. is it as hard as it shows in most youtube videos? no by dear god it is not. the game is difficult, and will leave you pissed off at many points, but none of the bosses are impossible to beat. even if they are for whatever reason, you can summon other players to help you out with the boss. it is what most soul veterans on youtube say, tough but fair.-a few words for the dlc. in my opinion, it isn't worth it full price, but if you can grab them at a discount or the season pass at a discount it really is. one dlc adds an area which is a very different but welcome change in enviroment, taking you to a snowy mountain type area, where as the other dlc takes you to a more familiar setting. both dlcs add quite a few new spells, weapons and armor sets with their own unique abilities.overall i will give this game a 9/10.",1
Positive,"Probably the easiest Souls game in the series and supposedly the last.I jumped into this straight from Dark Souls 1 because I heard that it has a lot more to do with that than 2.I haven't played 2 or Bloodborne even, but if 2's supposed to have more artificial difficulty and if Bloodborne is much faster & more dodge-focused then 3 sounds like a cakewalk in comparison. Bloodborne isn't technically a Souls game but looking at the gameplay it really may as well be with just a few different mechanics and name changes.Playing with a KB+M is very possible but the game's interface is very heavily designed towards playing with a controller as usual. You can at least play with both KB+M and a controller simultaneously if you feel the desire to switch it up.The plot's straightforward; slay the mentioned names and link the fire, again, at least if you want to. The lore's big and learned through reading item descriptions as usual and of course you can piece together certain events that have happened by reading the lore and following some things you see in the environment.The scenery in the series has always been neat to look at. A lot of areas you see in the distance tend to be places you've just walked on or will walk on which is always a neat way to show how sizable the world is. Unlike Dark Souls 1 though the world's a lot more linear and fewer maps are connected to one another. From beginning to end it feels more like I'm walking through a tunnel with only a few side-paths here and there. The level designs are pretty alright & can get clever as well as the shortcuts & contraptions. Because of linearity however the shortcuts are only really useful for the current area which is basically until you beat the area boss. By then you've already moved on to the next map so the only good reasons usually to go back to a particular map is to invade, be summoned for co-op, and look for possibly missed loot.I also think that there are way too many bonfires this time around, especially when bosses always spawn a bonfire after they've been defeated, too. It could be that it only looks that way to me due to how linear this game started to look. Some bonfire placements hardly make any sense. An example of this is where late in the game you beat a certain boss, it spawns the obligatory bonfire, but moving forward 20 steps or so there's another bonfire with not even an enemy in between making the one you took 20 steps for practically pointless.Only a little after the very first boss fight of the game you end up in a new Firelink Shrine which is now Demon's-Souls-esque hub of sorts where practically all the NPCS you meet in your journey end up if you allow them. I personally don't find most of the NPCs interesting and only a few really have any actual quests on 'em. Some of the NPC's quests are so specific that you'll most likely need a wiki or guide to complete them properly. It doesn't help either that some quests can abruptly end another without notice.Instead of the mechanic being a reward for going through a tough journey, you gain the ability to warp between bonfires practically as soon as you light the bonfire in Firelink. It makes the game look a lot smaller than it is but it's at least convenient.The gameplay's more focused on speed when it comes to attacking and avoiding damage even though the mechanics don't exactly suggest that.The game has a habit of throwing hordes of enemies at you and a lot of 'em can do frantic combos too making encounters like that more annoying than difficult, almost encouraging you to cheese through some areas through unconventional means. The beefier 1-on-1 focused mob enemies are a lot less stressful to try to beat. They can be crazy tough and tend to have an attack for almost wherever you go but they're a lot more fair to try and deal with so long as no other force joins in to harm you. The same goes for the bosses (save for 1 or 2 where a clone-esque enemy spawns).Mechanically I think practically all the bosses are designed pretty well, at least when faced alone. Plenty of them are considerably easier in co-op because every boss can be easily distracted just by doing a bit of damage to 'em. Practically all bosses attack fast and do combos & attacks for all angles so you really have to pay attention to what they do. Dodging in panic can be punishing & the same goes for badly timed heals which they tend to notice if you try to heal up and by then they'll usually try to interrupt that by having some kind of gap-closing attack.You find a weapon that best suits you, or use the right one that's best for the situation, or both.There's a hefty variety of equipment to customize yourself with based on your current build and/or personal preference. Each weapon now has a ""Weapon Art"" and depending on the weapon in hand it's either going to be a self-buff or a fancy attack with some more useful than another. Weapon Art uses the new Focus Point mechanic, which can be restored via Ashen Estus Flask, which is acquired at the start of the game. For melee weapons, you need enough FP to make a Weapon Art attack effective. For self-buffs & spells, it's best to just think of FP basically as ""mana"".In the games I've played in this series the only weapons I ever get truly accustomed with are large swords/greatswords, which aren't too slow and doesn't deflect from big shields when two-handed. I don't know much about other melee weapons, spells, & even the new FP mechanic as I barely use 'em. I've also got very little experience with shield-usage or even ""heavy"" builds as I usually just try to dodge-roll from everything with light/semi-light armor so I don't know what to say about all that and this popular ""poise"" issue.Instead of Humanity now there's Ember, which boosts your max HP by 30% and allows the usual online play of summoning someone and being invaded though you don't need an Ember yourself to be summoned. Hollowing is a progressive matter and you can't turn hollow in this game anymore unless you go through specific actions and then die a lot. Hollowing doesn't prevent you from anything now and reversing it requires more specific actions, a little more to permanently remove the ability to be hollowed. Even then you're only able to have the ability to be hollowed once per playthrough and the only good reason for doing it is for reaching an ending.Online play can get interesting but it can also be an absolute mess because some people's connections can be bad enough where it starts to look like they're running in place.There's a password system but its only purpose is to match you up with others who are using the same password so you can only be summoned by them and vice versa. Normally the game matches you up with people who are in the same level range as well as have a weapon with similar upgrade ranks, regardless whether or not they're the same type, but the password system disregards all that. Whoever is summoned in that manner though will have their stats match the host's, though I'm not exactly sure how. You can still be invaded regardless whether or not a password's been set.You can summon up to 2 co-op phantoms and be invaded by one dark phantom. With a certain item it's 3 co-op phantoms and 2 invaders. From my experience most of the people I've invaded have a phantom or two with them, making me think that the the majority of people that play this game are either bad enough to always want a partner with them and/or they've got friends to play with. Still, co-op with someone up to the boss and trying to screw someone over through invasions can be pretty fun. People complain about being interrupted from invasions but I'm pretty sure that's the point of it.There are a lot more things I feel like saying about this game and there are likely things I missed despite 4 playthroughs.It's not the best Souls game I think but it's still a decent one.",1
Positive,"Good game, Havent played a Dark souls game before but have played Bloodborne and this felt familair and was easy to get into, The overall game so far hasnt been that challenging but some areas definitely are, also it can be quite easy to miss quests.",1
Positive,"Like many of us who played this game, I was fairly new to the Dark Souls franchise. Playing only a little bit of Dark Souls, and none of Dark Souls 2 or Bloodborne, I had no idea what I was getting myself into. Having heard from some friends that this game was a bit easier on the ""noobs"" this time around, I gave it a go. I, as I found out later, had chosen one of the hardest starting classes for a newcomer, the thief. As I approached the first hollow in the cemetary, I was fairly instantly powerized into a fine shower of blood and viscera. Perspective thus gained, I realized that this was not Skyrim. Swinging wildly at the enemies as caution is thrown to the wind is not a valid strategy in DS3. After making a promise to myself to not use youtube to find out how the game worked, I started the ""learning out of desperation"" method of training. I died over and over, but after I had finally mastered the art of sidesteps and dodges with my tiny little knife, I had a realization. This was one of the first times ever in gaming in which I had absolutely no qualms about dying. Yes, I lost the in-game money, but at the same time I became more and more aware of what I was doing wrong and exactly how I could fix it. This game is hard, and at many points unforgiving, but unlike playing a game where the AI is simply cheating, the enemies function under the same rules and restrictions the player does. Because of this you don't die simply because the enemies are cheating, you die because you haven't learned how to fight them properly yet. This game not only has a great story and interesting world, but solid gameplay and great replayability, in both the new game plus modes, and a fresh start with a new class. The modular nature of weapons and armor and the leveling system means players can change how they play no matter what class they are. Because of all of these things, I give Dark Souls 3 a 9.5/10.",1

Positive,"I've steadfastly defended Dark Souls 2's merits against people who call it the low point of the series. Even with my love of the second entry, however, Dark Souls 3 is an improvement over both previous games in the series. Like all the other games, however, it comes with many caveats.and some are more visible than others.Visually, Dark Souls 3 is an upgrade over both previous entries. From Software has finally created a PC port that isn't inherently awful when it comes to looks, and even on low settings (which I was forced to use) the game looks gorgeous, with vibrant lighting effects, detailed character models, and amazing views. However, the game's color palette relies too often on grays, browns, yellow and dark green to convey its oppressive atmosphere, which also consists of a lot of castles, rather than wilderness: I'm not looking for Kirby, but more blue or other bright colors would have helped break up the monotony, especially in the later parts of the game. Characters still don't move their mouths when they talk, which is as disconcerting as you'd expect.The sound design continues to impress, with excellent boss themes that vary between epic orchestral bombing and slow, tragic farewells.A few well-used ambient musical threads set the mood well in the hub areas. Voice acting is well-done, encompassing a wide range of accents and speaking styles. The voice actors manage to capture subtle shifts in tone and tongue placement that accompany amusing or tragic situations, and is the best in the series without question.The game is finally, for the better, less vague when it comes to communicating its mechanics and story. There's still plenty to decipher, discover, theorize on and debate, but the basic threads and gameplay mechanics are finally made clear for all to see. As with previous entries in the series, each location offers tidbits of lore that feed into a larger story or the main plot, often coming to its conclusion in the form of a boss battle. The main plot incorporates so many events from all across the world that it's almost impossible to find a thread that isn't connected to the main story, for better or for worse.The characters are as interesting as you'd expect, especially at first, although some of them seem static, lacking characterization due to not having a questline associated with them or having one that is easily missed. Cornyx and Karla are the biggest examples of this, although Karla can be excused due to how late in the game you find her and her already-interesting status as a Shard of Manus. However, the few that do have complete questlines are some of the most interesting characters in the series, and the story-relevant bosses are all compelling (and sometimes horrible or tragic) people.Speaking of bosses, most of them are quite good. They're either interesting characters, difficult challenges, enjoyable fights, or all three. I felt that a few too many of them were humanoids, especially towards the end, which is ironic given how similar this statement is to the (usually baseless) statements made against Dark Souls 2's bosses. All of the lategame bosses, except for Oceiros, Ancient Wyvern and, arguably, the first phase of the Nameless King, are humanoids in armor, They're still interesting encounters, but having them all at the end is slightly stale.Gameplay has been largely unchanged, but the changes that have been made are important. Exploring areas is the same that it's always been, requiring you to struggle through traps, ambushes, and the lack of a map (which does wonders for memory training as you plot a course through some of the more mazelike zones).Combat is faster, taking more inspiration from Bloodborne than DS1/DS2, though blocking is still a viable tactic, and bows/greatbows are finally useful for more besides luring enemies out due to increased damage and speed (crossbows are still, unfortunately, useless). The addition of ""Focus Points"" (mana, in other words) turns out to be a good choice, as nearly all playstyles make use of it since it governs special weapon skills, not just spellcasting.Speaking of casters, spellcasting has been nerfed into oblivion. I normally wouldn't complain about that, given the status of spells in Dark Souls 2 at launch (i.e. they were ridiculously overpowered), but near-uselessness of spellcasting discourages multiple playstyles. Furthermore, the absence of poise means that strength-heavy playstyles have reduced viability since hyper armor is much harder to find, and any old dagger can stunlock you even if you're wearing the heaviest armor in the game.These changes feed into the worst part of the game: the PVP and Covenants. PVP is a complete joke, with a huge abundance of gank squads and legions of stale, identical builds due to the imbalanced nature of fast weapons in a meta where poise does not exist. Though lag is less of a problem than it was in Dark Souls 2, some baffling changes (like not being able to get invaded if you've beaten the boss of an area) make finding certain kinds of PVP much harder. Auto-summon covenants are completely broken, even with several patches to try and alleviate the issue, forcing you to farm for covenant items if you want the rewards (or the achievements).I spent over ten hours farming for items for the Blades of the Darkmoon/Blue Sentinels . I was never summoned to help someone. I never want to see a Silver Knight again.However, invading as a wild-card Mound Maker or summoning your friends (or being summoned by them) works remarkably well and is great fun. The addition of a password system makes it even easier to find your friends.In some ways, Dark Souls 3 feels like it's got a bit of an identity crisis. It doesn't know if it wants to take the combat of Bloodborne, the PVP of Dark Souls 2, or the world of Dark Souls 1 and just tries a little of each, to mixed results, instead of finding a way to balance all three or try something new. The PVP takes many of the improvements from Dark Souls 2, but decisions that make it more like Bloodborne or Dark Souls 1 result in some of the worst PVP in the series. The combat is fast, like Bloodborne, but removes the viability of slower builds and other changes minimize the usefulness of spells. The world is so attached to that of Dark Souls 1 that it feels like Dark Souls 3 doesn't have a story of its own. Instead of building on, or leaping off the steps established by Dark Souls 1 and 2, the first is focused on almost exclusively. However, the ways that the story does tie into Dark Souls 2, with the Profaned Capital, Yhorm, Aldia, Smouldering Lake, and two of the game's four endings are impressive.In the end, Dark Souls 3 is a great game and the best in the series. It tries, and generally succeeds, at taking what worked from previous SoulsBorne games and putting them together, but not without serious issues. If this is really the last Souls game (and I hope it's not), it's leaving on a successful, but divisive note.Pros Excellent music and voice acting Impressive visuals Jaw-dropping bosses Interesting characters and stories Some new mechanics (Focus bar, primarily) change combat for the better Massive, mazelike zones with a huge amount of deadly traps and enemies Fun community and co-operative playCons PVP and Covenants really kind of suck due to poor performance or gameplay changes No poise contributes to previously stated problem Game lacks its own identity, struggling to balance between previous entries Lack of diversity in viable builds Game doesn't change for NG+ LOTS of grinding for rare items for covenants Muted color palette Linear path through most of game Got sick of seeing cathedrals",1
Positive,"Amazing game so far. Loved Dark Souls, but found Dark Souls 2 quite hard to get into. Dark Souls 3 feels a lot more like true Dark Souls sequel than DS2 did, to me.Visually there has been a major upgrade. The game looks great. Same awesome creature/boss design. The base game seems pretty big. I'll definitely grab the season pass at some point though. One of the only games where I feel like the season pass is worth getting.It's been a long time since I played a game where I found myself looking forward to the next time I would get to play it (probably Dark Souls). It feels good to have a game that is worthy of my time. The Dark Souls series may be challenging, but it never feels like a chore to play through, which the majority of games I have played in recent times have felt like. Most of them have also felt like a waste of money as I lost interest in them before I got my moneys worth. Definitely getting my moneys worth out of Dark Souls 3.Whether you are new to the series, or a veteran player, I'd highly recommend this game.Only negative thing I can say about it is that I am experiencing a persistent stuttering issue (I have a i7 4790K, 16GB DDR3 1600 RAM and a GTX970 4GB. The game is also running off of an SSD). It doesn't really effect the gameplay too much, but it isn't exactly ideal, either.I am not sure if it is network related, or possibly sound related, or will be addressed with new graphics drivers. I recall a similar issue with Dirt 3 that was resolved by installing some 3D audio software. Might hunt that down and try it as a fix.Anyway. Yes. Amazing game so far. Love it!",1
Positive,This game is playing amazing on my computer. It runs perfectly with no crashing or anything wrong.

There is defintely some impact felt when you smack someone or something with the weapons, really well done.Graphics wise; the game looks beautiful, although the framerate does dip a bit in some areas and when autosaving.In short;Yes.",1
Positive,Dark Souls 3 has been an amazing adventure it's a game I can keep putting more and more hours into and still enjoy every second. In Dark Souls 3 I love the references to the first and second games in the series they bring back great and terrible memories. Overall I would say Dark Souls 3 is a titan of medieval fantasy RPG's with its challenging gameplay to its emotional story telling with every monster big or small being able to kill you and every little detail having the deepest of meanings. So yes I would say buy this great game and be amazed at how it can surprise you with every twist and turn it takes. (IMPORTANT) The only thing I would say is play Dark Souls 1 first otherwise you miss a lot of the important plot points in the game.,1

Positive,"This is probably my favorite video game. One of the very best character action games of all time, and with so many ways to replay! The multiplayer is tons of fun, especially co-op. Where else can you wordlessly convince a whole game session of strangers to dress up in matching pope outfits and equip flame gauntlets and run into a danger zone and all explode after using the HELLO stone 300 times? Where else can you invade another player and spend 30 minutes trying to find them, and when you finally do, you're both so impressed by each other's respective hiding and seeking skills that instead of fighting, you dance around each other, chug all your estus, and commit mutual ritualistic suicide with clouds of deadly mercury? Dark souls 3 is one of the best horror-action RPGs of all time, but the multiplayer is one of the best comedy games of all time. Nothing else (aside from sometimes other souls games) comes close to this kind of wild and fleeting anonymous multiplayer magic. It's also incredibly beautifully art-directed, the music is pretty good, the sound design is incredible and satisfying, the feel of controlling the character is near perfect in how weighty but responsive it is, the story is fascinating in how it takes the existing lore of dark souls and twists it and recontextualizes it, and the RPG systems are really fun to figure out and all feed back into the gameplay in cool ways. It also has some great level design and by far the best boss fights in the history of video game. I will never forget finally beating Darkeater Midir or Sister Friede after hours of gradually mastering every movement and reaction and attack. Very few games can inspire awe, joy, triumph, fear, and hilarious laughing fits, but this one does all of that. Absolute Game of the Century.",1

Positive,"After playing this game twice now, I can say without a doubt that it kicked my ass both times around. Did I enjoy it? Yes. Yes I did. The characters, story, world, all of them draw me back in no matter how many times I see that dreaded ""You Died"" screen. By far, a better experience than DS/Prepare to Die/Remastered, but I can't say anything about 2 as I haven't played it yet. The PVP feels far less clunky than the first and the rolling and attacking take up less stamina than DS 1, making the game a bit more bareable.All in all, game good. Buy it. The DLC is quite worth the pricetag as well, they each add a new area and at least the second one adds multiple challenging bosses.",1

Positive,"I'll get straight to the point. When they announced Dark Souls 3, my first reaction was ""ok cool, but so quick after the last game?"". I didn't have high expectations, but Dark Souls 3 is in my opinion the best game in the series. It is the most polished, the most balanced, the most EPIC. And it is not just a masterpiece in its own right, it is also a fantastic finale to the series for tons of reason. I won't spoil anything, but the final boss of this game is the best bossfight of all time in my opinion, in EVERY aspect.Dark Souls 3's world design is more linear than Dark Souls 1's, but it still offers at least the same amount of exploration, secrets and optional content. This is great, because it doesn't sacrifice what made Dark Souls 1's world design so special, but at the same time is more guided and balanced. Also because of that the game feels more like a journey from A to B with lots of different branches and obstacles. The level design itself is easily on the level of Dark Souls 1. Often you will arrive at some high point in the world from where you can see most of the other regions, so you always know at what part of the world you are, you are always orientated. This is just great and shows how much planning went into the design of the world of Dark Souls 3.But that is just the mechanical design of the world, visually it is also really unique, although some areas might resemble Bloodbourne, but I can't judge that, because I never played Bloodbourne (I have no PS4). No region feels like filler, every region has its landmarks and epic locations. The only little dissapointing thing is that some enemy types you encounter very early in the game keep appearing throughout the whole game. One of those enemy types is also not that interesting, although if it was just a simple enemy for one area it would be fine. It's not that big of a problem, it is the only criticism I have for this game actually.What I really love about Dark Souls 3 is how they handled the exploration. Item and weapon placement is very clever this time around unlike Dark Souls 2. The time to the next weapon or armor is always short enough that it doesn't get boring, but also long enough that it still feels special and like a reward. Also they removed all of the useless items from Dark Souls 2. All items you find in Dark Souls 3 will be useful to you more or less, depending on your class, but it's not like you find tons of items and always think ""why the hell do you give me this?"". One of the items you will find a lot by exploring is crafting material to upgrade your weapons. Because the world is more linear, the developers could also balance these crafting materials better. You can't get a super upgraded weapon early on, just accelerate the process a bit by exploring and finding secrets, but at some point the developers will give you a lot of the materials of the tier you are currently supposed to be at.There is normal titanite, twinkling titanite and titanite scale. This is also great, because the upgrade system in previous Dark Souls games was unneccessarily complicated. This streamlines the process without sacrificing depth. Also the infusion system has been overhauled and streamlined without sacrificing depth and there are more options now, even if you aren't playing some exotic character or mage/cleric/pyro. Maybe there are too many options to be honest, but this wouldn't really be a problem.Another thing I love is that there isn't a boss every hour like in Dark Souls 2. The motto clearly was quality over quantity. You have to fight hard and long to get to the new boss, and because of that, every bossfight feels special and thankfull the bossfights themselves are all really well made. Every boss has a unique and epic looking bossfight room and the soundtrack is AMAZING too. I just hoped the Lords of Cinder would be a bit more difficult, they were actually among the easier bosses of the game, maybe that is intentional, but it isn't really a problem, because they are still challenging and epic.Apparently online pvp, convenants and all that stuff also has been improved, but I only played offline and don't care about covenants, so I can't judge that. One last thing I want to mention is the selection of weapons and armors in this game. It is just awesome. It's like a ""best of"" of the best armors from Dark Souls 1, 2 and some new ones from Dark Souls 3. From all armors I found and bought, like 70% of them are so good I can't decide which one to use, the others are also really good and don't feel unneccessary, unlike Dark Souls 2 where you found million of different armor pieces from shit enemies which looked like garbage. Again, quality over quantity, overall there are less weapons and armors than in Dark Souls 2, but every single one of them is great.At the end Dark Souls 3 is the most polished, most balanced, most epic entry to the series. For me it is actually even better than Dark Souls 1, and that means a lot, because Dark Souls 1 is also a 10/10 for me. What made this game truly special though, is the final boss. Definitly worth buying at full price.",1

Positive,"I used to describe the Soulsbourne games to others by saying that they are ""games that hate you."" I've come to realize that that's not true though. They are games that respect you; they expect that you're perfectly capable of figuring stuff out, and so they give you the tools you need and then let you figure it out from there. Souls games punish the arrogant, but if you come to them humble and willing to learn then you will find them to be some of the most rewarding experiences in gaming.",1
Positive,"So I'm a rabid fan of the Dark Souls games. There's no denying this fact, not from me or anyone else. I was hooked the moment I played Demons' Souls so long ago, bought a Playstation 3 specifically to play Dark Souls, pre-ordered Dark Souls II without a second thought, and ordered a steam-controller specifically to play Dark Souls III, which I pre-ordered as well and marked on my calendar the day it was coming out.Basically, if you're looking for an unbiased source on this game's quality, you will not find it here. If you're wondering what a diehard fanboy thinks of this game, carry on.Spoiler alert: I LOVE it. From the lore to the gameplay to the design, I'm as much in love with this game as I was with all the previous Souls games. I love the dark, gritty, decayed worlds of lost sanity that make it seem like your character is wandering through a masterwork art piece. I love the hidden lore that is difficult to pry apart and uncover, granting only glimpses into a deep pool of history, like we're some sort of Dark Age's knight glancing at the ruins of the Colosseum, wondering what beings could both create such wonders and yet not avoid their own demise. I love the brutal, relentless combat that makes you fight for every inch and punishes you mercilessly for stepping a fraction out of line. That adrenaline rush when you're invaded, that sense of accomplish when a boss is defeated, that ever so slow but sure grind out of the pit of hell you've been thrust into only to find the pit never ends as you've become one with the madness.Essentially, Dark Souls III brings back all the best parts of the Dark Souls series and adds some flair of its own. Firstly, it's easier to invade in this game than in previous ones, and covenants aren't as binding as they once were. Players can switch freely between covenants and play for whichever team they want. DS3 also did a better job than DS2 in allowing players to level up their weapons and gear more freely, granting them more options on a single play-through. DS3 eliminated the Soul Memory concept from DS2, which has allowed for twinking to happen again, but it's not that bad in my opinion. I kind of embrace the challenge myself, and even look forward to making anti-twinks, so to speak. DS3 has also added the new feature of weapon arts, which is really a great concept that I've quickly fallen for.But beyond that, it's pretty much the same game, and I'm so, so happy about that.",1
Positive,"Came for the challenge, stayed for the community. This game was my intro to Fromsoft and at this point I've played all their Souls games with the exception of Bloodborne.Beautiful art direction, amazing boss soundtracks, excellent level design (with very few exceptions), and surprisingly good voice acting. Lore's even pretty mesmerizing though you probably won't think much of it your first time through. Multiplayer is hit or miss, I don't recommend worrying about being serious with it until a couple playthroughs in.If you're unsure about the difficulty, ember up and summon a friend - the lack of voice chat makes it all the more fun. And don't worry about checking forums or wikis - the community is actually very supportive and welcoming, and dare I say unusually mature for a video game fandom.",1

We fought our way through a bunch of monsters, then he showed me a shortcut, and our fight with the giant, where we both almost died, because we had to out-aggro him, you should have seen it. And so after 10 minutes of exploring the loki we reach the room of the leader of the marauder covenant. But you can't enter there while you have a phantom with you. and he takes some special sword and uses its special ability on ctrl, dealing a small amount of damage to himself, piercing himself with this sword (Most likely it's a buff damage or something like that). I see this and don't quite understand what he's doing, he stops and points to the door to the covenant room, like go there. And he pierces himself again, I try to show him with gestures to stop, but he only points to the room again and continues piercing himself with the sword. I couldn't do anything, he was dying before my eyes. And so, when he dealt the last blows to himself, I could only bow to him.

Thank you Miyazaki and everyone who worked on this masterpiece of a franchise that to many people will consider it one of if not the best game franchise of all time.",1
Positive,"SPOILERS AHEAD I still find it difficult to form a clear impression of the game, considering that I started my journey with the Souls genre at the end of last year, specifically with the first Dark Souls Remastered and Bloodborne at the same time (which I will likely return to most often). So, through this writing, I will finally try to reach some consensus.I suppose it all started with Elden Ring. As I began playing, from the very start in Limgrave, I realized, ""No, this won t do; I need to understand all of this from the very beginning."" Since I didn t have access to Demon s Souls on PS3, it was easiest to start with Dark Souls Remastered. As I mentioned, I played Bloodborne simultaneously, partly to overcome my relative dislike of the medieval setting. Despite everything, the dark fantasy setting completely covered this. But the Gothic Victorian setting, Lovecraftian horrors, and numerous plot theories added their variety to the gaming experience. So, what happens if you add even more horror, sorrow, and a sense of inevitability to an already existing world of unavoidable encounters with death? The answer is Dark Souls 3.For context, I will compare it with Bloodborne not only because I played it before Dark Souls 3 but also because these games were released almost at the same time - 2015 and 2016. With the involvement of the same studio and game designer, and at the same time the CREATOR, FATHER OF THE GENRE, PROPHET AND MESSIAH, PRAISE THE SUN, MIYAZAKI IS A GENIUS! While playing, I was constantly accompanied by the thought that Dark Souls 3 is like being asked to recreate their Magnum Opus (Bloodborne), and everything turned out just right, but. And here ""but"" is not from a negative point of view, but from the point of view of questions that arise. It might be good to break it down into short sub-points, namely:MusicBossesPlotI bring this point up first because, as it became clear to me, music is a reflection and reinforcement of the overall atmosphere. Dark Souls 3 is grandeur and epic. The eternal confrontation of Fire and Darkness, atmosphere, and drama. which are not always a full reflection of the events happening. For example, with Vordt or Pontiff Sulyvahn, there is tension, but there is no change in mood during the battle. The mood of the two bosses does not match the themes playing parallelly. This cannot be said about Friede, Midir, Dancer, or Twin Princes theme. Meanwhile, a year earlier, in a hundred percent ratio, the horror, anxiety, pain, and madness of Yharnam were conveyed. The main disadvantage, in my opinion, was the lack of correspondence between what was happening and what was sounding. This creates a kind of dissonance, making it hard for me to recall a truly captivating melody from Dark Souls 3.I won't stay on how important bosses are for the series and will move on to my opinion. It is immediately noticeable that the bosses are calm, and balanced, each with its approach and key to solving a particular problem. Everything would be great if it did not violate uniqueness and authenticity. Namely - borrowing from (forgive me I didn't mean to) Bloodborne.So, basically: Friede is Lady Maria on steroids Midir is a pumped-up Amygdala (not even Kalameet or Ancient Dragon ) Slave-Knight Gael is Orphan of Kos + Martyr Logarius Curse-Rotted Greatwood is The One Reborn Oceiros is Blood-starved Beast Lorian and Lothric is Ludwig (that one is a direct hit in my heart)I emphasize that this is not bad at all, each of them has unique abilities. However, the high similarity and borrowing of certain mechanics or movesets somewhat simplifies the understanding or personal approach to overcoming the bosses.I can't complain about the plot because it is wonderful. Many references to the first part, the gradation of the world's degradation as the main part of the game progresses, and interaction with secondary characters is simply magnificent (especially the engagement option - personally, I liked this turn the most). And a wonderful kind of borrowing. Just as we find the Abandoned Old Workshop in Bloodborne, in Dark Souls 3 we have the Untended Graves, where, as for the Doll, we find a comb, so for the Firekeeper we bring her eyes. Quite a cute borrowing, in my opinion.It may seem that above I mentioned facts that I consider more shortcomings for Dark Souls 3 than anything else. Actually, no. It's just the impression that too much was taken from what already exists during the creation of certain ideas. It's not Bloodborne on PC, it's not better or worse. It's just. in some places very similar.Answering honestly whether it's a great game - yes, whether it's interesting - yes, whether it's worth playing more than once - undoubtedly. But, the only thing that makes me sad the most - is that I played Bloodborne earlier than I played Dark Souls 3.",1

Positive,"With Dark Souls II feeling more isolated from the first (But by no means a bad game), Dark Souls III hones it back in as the true successor to Dark Souls. Everything about this game is amazing. As expected, FromSoftware have had time to refine the beautiful combat system that makes Dark Souls what it is, and in this instalment, it does not disappoint. Everything is much smoother, with omni directional rolling and a wider variety of unique weapons and spells, everything feels so complete. The boss fights in this game feel very open and free, often with the boss itself being the tether that pulls you into your movement with well timed dodges rather than environmental events. Furthermore, the DLC feels like the cherry on top, featuring an absolutely, indisputably unmissable final boss, that compliments the main game final boss like peanut butter and jelly. This game and it's DLC are a must-have, but by no means should you skip out on the original Dark Souls. This game is close to perfect, but it is not a reason to overlook the classic, which I can easily say is my favourite game of all time. Go play Dark Souls, then come back and play this and it's DLC. Play how you like, run it solo, play with friends, or play with strangers, after all, you can't beat some jolly cooperation. Explore the world, find yourself tinkering to perfect your build, or go for some good old classic fashion souls, but most of all, Prepare To Die.",1

Positive,"Its just as good as people say. I am a late comer to the souls-like and started with elden ring. And surprisingly, it does pretty good in comparison. Coming from elden ring, i do miss the convenience of a map and a compass. Pretty easy to get lost in some areas like the marsh of Farran Keep without a sense of direction (took me over 2 hours just to find my way around the place). But other than that, the game does live up to its fame. The game strikes a perfect balance between difficulty and satisfaction (once you overcome the hurdle). This is the difference between a well made game and a souls-like wannabe like Nioh 2. Just look at the basic enemies in each area. Every single one is completely different from the others. They have unique move sets, skills and weaknesses/vulnerabilities. The game teaches you to fight them without any hand-holding. I died to the first dancing knight of Irythill about 10 times. And then i never died to them again (not even when they appear in a group of 3). And the bosses! Oh the Bosses! I am sure people have made hour-long videos on youtube about the ingenuity of the bosses. The world building and story-telling is awesome. Shortcuts to boss battles or any difficult encounter only serves to increase the player convenience without creating meaningless hurdles like making them go through 50 enemies again and again every time they die to the boss (I am looking at you Nioh 2). If you haven't played a souls game, give this a try. It is a difficult game (you WILL die. SEVERAL TIMES), no doubt; but i can assure you that you will play it again and again.",1

Positive,"After my experiences with Elden Ring, Dark Souls, and Dark Souls II, I expected a lot from this game. after all, i couldn't stop hearing about how amazing of a game it was from countless comments, posts, and videos on the internet.And yet, even with these very high expectations, Dark Souls III blew me away. The Bosses, Level Design, Music, just everything was cranked up to 11. I can't think of many places where i thought, ""this is designed terribly"". Combat has a great flow(as always with souls games), every boss was fantastically designed(except Deacons of the Deep, the only boss i thought was really mediocre.), and i have to again mention the music. The music in this game is just. godly. It really adds to the feel of many of the bossfights, especially the final boss, when i heard Plin Plin Plon in the background of the theme.In conclusion, Dark Souls III is a masterpiece, and i urge anyone who's looking for a challenge to play it.",1
Positive,Never thought dying could be so addictive :D XD,1
Positive,Solid Dark Souls game! very fun big sword go swoosh,1
Positive,"Dark Souls III is honestly one of the best games I have ever played. I came to the Souls series after beating Elden Ring, and after beating both DS1 and DS3, I can say that I love the linear feel to these games so much. In a quick summary, DS3 is already worth playing just because of the bosses. The bosses in this game are unmatched, and each one feels extremely unique and genuinely fun to fight. The areas are unique, the weapons and armor are sick, and the story is outstanding. DS3 makes you feel a sense of loneliness and darkness that only the original Dark Souls can rival. The few issues that DS3 have are very minor, and are covered up by the rest of the game. DS3 is how a sequel should be done! Critically, this is probably incorrect, but in my opinion, Dark Souls 3 is a masterpiece!(If you're coming off of beating Elden Ring, Dark Souls 3 is probably the closest Souls-game to it. They're combat and environments tend to feel similar.)",1

Positive,"Best Souls game? No, Very fun game? Heck yeah.Ds3, being the most recent ""Dark souls"" title definitely feels much more beautiful graphics wise (can't beat Majula/Heide's tower of flame) when compared to older titles, along with handling better than the previous ones, even with all of its flaws (god-awful dog ganks or normal ganks, (Irythill and Irythill dungeon in particular), unfun invasion just like previous titles, as many awful bosses as previous titles, etc), however you rarely feel as though these issues hinder the game as it is just that good of a game.All in all, a fantastic game with some obvious flaws, flaws which are mostly all alright to deal (with no game-breaking bugs in general).However, having absolutely adored the world and lore of both Ds1 and Ds2, I have to say that Ds3 definitely feels the worse of them all, with both of these aspects which seems to have taken a backseat compared to gameplay, which can be an improvement for most people, as I do believe that most players look forward to the gameplay more than the lore and world design.",1
Positive,"Although it is not my favourite FromSoft game, what DS3 may lack in world building, (although the lore and scenery is superb the world feels built around you and - in my opinion- DS3 is less immersive then the likes of the other FS games) it more than makes up for in the boss fights and the AMAZING DLCs. I have at least a thousand hours on this game on console and it never ceases to provide me with quality entertainment.The last fight of the Ringed City DLC - and the Souls series- is so beautifully poetic. DS3 was an astounding write off to these games and manages to maintain a strong Souls identity while re-vamping the combat system, and exploring the identity of the series- with its new perspectives ob hollowing and humanity itself.One thing that has always bothered me about DS3 is that it feels incomplete without the DLCs. The ending can feel sudden, and the last boss fight of the base game is painfully mediocre.8.6/10",1

I started Elden Ring which is just as rich if not more in play but I find myself coming back to DS3 simply for the feel of the game mechanics. What can I say besides praise the sun, broes.

Positive,"Incredible souls experience, I am really glad I chose to enter the genre with this,Visually, the game is actually stunning. Like I am playing it what. 6 years after release? And yes, close details, monsters will show the age but cutscenes? Sceneries? Those are so good-looking, that I just had to press screenshot button.Soundtrack is epic and cool. Probably best moment was during last boss fight when piano starts playing. I was touched deep in my soul by that.Finally, gameplay. It is souls and I have literally almost zero complaints to it, everything works as it should, bosses are difficult by the right amount (I was telling myself over and over again ""If it was not for this mechanic"", which means basically well structured boss fights). Worst problem was with camera (especially felt this problem with Midir), which sometimes unlocks or spins weird way and got me killed.Second problem were lags, my game sometimes just froze 1-4 times for like 10 seconds. Really annoying.Overall, solid experience I would recommend any hardcore player.",1
Positive,"Within the shadows of Dark Souls 3 lies a realm of unrelenting trials, where the embers of challenge burn brightly. The intricate design and profound intricacies paint a bleak canvas of perseverance and discovery. With each encounter, one delves into a tapestry of triumph and anguish, forging ahead through the abyssal landscapes. The interwoven complexities allow diverse pathways to mastery, beckoning players to fashion their fate through varied builds and strategies. Yet, amidst the unforgiving brutality, a haunting beauty emanates, etching an indelible mark upon those brave enough to tread its desolate paths. In Dark Souls 3, the crucible of hardship births an experience steeped in unparalleled satisfaction and relentless allure. (dragon slayer can suck my toes)",1
Positive,"what i liked:+ brilliant world design and connectivity. from software is well known for this aspect of their games and dark souls 3 isn't an exception to it.+ exploration is worthwhile with a lot of optional content, secrets, items and many more to be found. it is basically one of the best games in terms of exploration i've ever played. the maps are big enough to give you the feeling of freedom, but linear and small enough to provide a rewarding experience which won't get repetitive at any point in the game.+ combat is obviously one of the major selling points of this series and it's playing out so well in dark souls 3. really can't complain much, but keep in mind there will be some clunky and odd combat moments, like when you strafe an enemy in combat and punish his hitbox with a backstab.+ an impressive amount of the boss designs were well designed and diverse. dark souls 3 had some of the best bosses i've ever played. friede for example (screw you haters, she's awesome) and gael is probably one of my most favorite bosses of all time.+ enemy and boss variety is decent and the amount of reused content isn't even worth mentioning.+ there is a lot of build variety to be found with many viable weapons and spells. ranging from different types of weapons to several schools of magic. i've had a blast trying out different weapon and greatswords were my absolute favorites. style, damage and stagger.+ interesting and well thought out lore, but as usual for games of the souls series, it's kinda vague and hidden all over the game. definitely worth diving into and the use of a wiki is highly recommended.+ timeless graphics with some minor flaws, which won't matter too much. the artstyle is pretty impressive like all modern from software games are. despite the graphics are looking kinda outdated, the atmosphere is insanely good and the scenery is quite impressive. sadly some the blurry backdrops far away hurt the overall quality.+ orchestral soundtrack and an atmospheric sound design making the game quite scary while delving through these tainted and monster infested dungeons.+ there are some memorable and iconic npcs with interesting quest lines, like the onion knight, londor crew, greyrat and patches, but sadly others are a tad bit uninspired and it feels like they're simply in the game for the sake of being a merchant or a teacher.+ fair bonfire placement is holding the run back at bay.what felt debatable to me:~ some of the hit boxes are kinda odd, i have to admit.~ swamps are no fun in this game (or in any game honestly). constantly slow walking through muddy ground and slow rolling. the cherry on top are status effects like poison (which is kinda fine due to the low damage) or toxic. it's manageable tho if played properly.~ questionable controls for jumping.what i disliked:- the covenants were straight garbage in my opinion. pvp servers are basically down since early 2022 and items / achievements are tied to the covenants.10/10",1

Positive,"Dark Souls III is an amazing title, filled to the brim with some of FromSoft's best bosses, music, art, and more! It's also the closest souls title to Bloodborne available on PC (at least in my opinion), so if you like that game, you will probably also like this game, too. I would highly recommend that you play Dark Souls: Remastered before DS3, though, just to give yourself an idea of what this and the later FromSoft Souls games are like (I know Sekiro, BB, and Elden Ring aren't apart of the Souls Series, but they all feature very similar mechanics).Overall, it's a phenomenal package and you will definitely remember this game for years to come after completing it (like any FromSoft game, aside from DS2)!

Positive,"~SPOILER FREE REVIEW~Not gonna be biased coz I actually 100% this game. The perils of this game has now come to rest, and finally I can sleep in peace knowing that I fully completed this game.DISCLAIMER - NOT SHAMING ANYONE IN THE DIFFICULTY SECTION. PLEASE DON'T KILL ME :(Gameplay: SOULS BORNE GAME! So, please, DO NOT complain about the controls. This game has good gameplay, you run through areas, following the story, kill enemies, get to bosses, clap the bosses, get to next area etc. The controls are responsive and I can rarely blame the controls if I ever died. There were some points where I would question hitboxes of enemies, but they aren't that many. Overall, solid gameplay, just GIT GUD at rolling and maintaining stamina. Seriously, sometimes I feel that having the liberty to roll a lot just kinda breaks some bosses, but it's balanced coz some bosses, they make your stamina bar look really really small coz no matter what you do, you'd run out of stamina real quick. Story: Ever heard of story being told via reading Item Descriptions? Well, that's how you decipher the major parts of the story. The story told to you is via small cutscenes and you figure out what is going on. Basically, you fill in the blanks, but there are a F*** ton of blanks. I would recommend playing Dark souls 1 (first) coz the story is better. I'm not saying the story of this game is bad, it's just not a masterpiece, but it is amazing. I bought the season pass too with the deluxe edition and trust me, that was worth my money. The DLCs were great, they had absolutely good lore, areas and boss designs (except a few enemy designs of course) but overall, worth my money. Bugs - NOMultiplayer aspect - I didn't engage with multiplayer much? Because I think this is a 5 year old game and the playerbase is dead? I did get invaded a couple of times, not much, and later due to the RCE exploit, RIP DARK SOULS SERVERS. So I was playing offline and grinding covenant items (which btw, broke me)Difficulty - Listen to me. THIS GAME IS MEANT TO BE HARD. PLEASE DON'T LET THAT TURN YOU OFF. And tbh, the game wasn't hard for me. Yea obviously, the game was hard in the beginning when you are figuring stuff out, IT IS MEANT TO BE HARD. The satisfaction you get from completing this game, ok, not the game, but the satisfaction you get for killing bosses who beat you down, is just off the roof. This game tests your patience. 1 wrong move, and that can throw the fight against a boss, or even a normal mob. I threw so many fights when the bosses were a few hits away from death. Be Patient. You will beat them eventually, just, don't be greedy. If you are some whiny, crappy journalist type of guy who just cries while playing easy mode and or judges games based on their difficulty and or just like OMG THIS GAME SO HARD ITS BS, don't even consider playing this game. I am not shaming you, I'm telling you that this game is not for you. This is when you should consider your taste in choosing video games. You don't like a game, you don't have to play the game, and or hate on the game. This game (for those people who don't know) have a system where when you die, the souls you have on you, drop on the spot or near to where you die, and you respawn at the last bonfire you rested at (basically checkpoint). You die one more time before getting those souls, well, say goodbye to it. This is meant to be a way of teaching you that you made a mistake the first time, and you died then, this time, when you were given a chance, you didn't learn from your previous mistake and made the same or a different mistake again. This game doesn't have BS difficulty, it is just meant to be that way.Music - SPECTACULAR MUSIC DURING BOSS FIGHTS100% COMPLETION DIFFICULTY - 7/10 - HARD - COZ OF THE FARMING YOU GOTTA DOFINAL SCORE - 9.5/10 - AMAZING Good Luck my friend, and Don't You Dare Go Hollow :)Praise the Sun",1

Positive,"Dark Souls III was a solid-ass entry to this series. As the finale of the Dark Souls series, (so we're told), it pakcs a punch. From the very beginning of the game, facing off against Iudex Gundyr, up to the very end, taking out Slave Knight Gael, there wasn't a moment I could put this down. This is another one that I bought after already getting all achievements on PS4, and I still have 100 hours in it on PC because it's just that good. The game is much more fast-paced than its predecessors, and there's hardly a moment to take a rest when you start a playthrough. The co-op was also improved a ton in this game, simply requiring a password to play with your friends. Overall, this game was by far the most advanced in quality of life changes, and as a result, feels like it has the least ""bullshit"" moments where you die out of seemingly nowhere or from some buggy game mechanic or area.Cinematic playthrough here:",1

Positive,"I have just finished ng+4 and now have all the achievements, and let me tell you. I might have 156 hours and I might be not experienced enough to call myself a good dark souls player but this was one of the best games I have played in my life yet.It drives you forward as you keep dying and trying again and again as you learn through failure and this is the feeling I have been looking for this whole time. Achieving something you are battling for, something you kept trying on doing feels better than sex.I sat through the whole credits when got the dark soul achievement.",1

Positive,"It's just one of the greatest games that have ever been made, an absolute masterpiece of game design and dark fantasy literature.I've had a few special words to say about Dark Souls II a couple of weeks ago but Dark Souls III is just a classic, there is no way I will be able to convey my emotions or thoughts about this game in this small text box.+ it has one of the best soundtrack albums in gaming history imo, really this game is something else and even though this is my 4th or 5th playthrough -I don't remember really :< but it's obviously my first on Steam- I played through it with the same anticipation and addictiveness.",1

By tackling the adversity, by challenging yourself, through planning, resolve, and memorization, you will perfect the art of adaptation.

It has a good dificulty and a good gameplay. It is worth a buy.Because of this game i have now a Girlfriend. Thanks Obama,1
Positive,"Probably the most replayable entry in the series because of how linear it is which can be good or bad depending n how you see it, you won't get the sprawling interconnectivity from DS1 but you will get the best boss lineup in souls and a very replayable game with a lot of fun playstyles.",1
Positive,"Absolutely great game. Exceedingly frustrating at first, especially if you're going in blind. After you get the hang of it though it becomes extremely addicting and very fun, especially for hardcore gamers who like a real challenge. The bosses and the lore of the game are very deep and it makes it that much more fun when you truly understand the bosses you fight and understand their lore and where they fit into the story. 10/10.",1

Positive,Almost smashed my wardrobe to bits. 10/10 would ng+9 again,1

Positive,"People say it's hard because you die a lot. I say dying is part of the gameplay. If you die a lot, you aren't doing anything wrong, you're just learning how to progress. It certainly doesn't hold your hand, and it's one of the harder games out there, but don't let the difficulty scare you away.",1
Positive,"Fine challenging gothic/dark fantasy metroidvania with an emphasis on melee combat.Not as hard as everyone makes it out to be but I might have been very over leveled the whole game.I don't think its really worth $60, especially as someone who prefers story based RPGs. The combat is fun but NOT realistic as some people like to describe it.Pros:-Well made / few bugs- PvE feels balanced- lots of outfit and weapon varietyCons:-anime feel/way over exaggerated -some enemies should not respawn but do (looking at you summoners in the ringed city)-graphics are a bit outdated-very poor keyboard and mouse support (no keyboard button prompts, only controller)",1

Positive,this game is harder then jeffrey epstein in a kindergarden. 10/10,1
Positive,needs more sun men,1
Positive,"Based Dark Souls 3.This is a game with replayability in mind. It's not as immersive as the first game, and it's not as experimental as the second game. It's the refined formula of the series. It's made for interacting with other players. If you haven't played any Dark Souls yet, this isn't a bad place to start.It has serious depth.If you two hand weapons, you get a strength and damage bonus, but lose the use of your off hand.If you one hand weapons, you risk enemies and other players attacking through your attacks, but have more mobility. If you choose spells, you get AOEs, powerful missile attacks, and can enchant your weapons for tons of damage. But you lose mobility when you have to refill your mana and recast.You can also min-max your physical attributes by using items for buffs. Or limit your level to negate the drawbacks of your character.This is a game for people that like to plan builds. Stats are interconnected.What I enjoy most about this game, is all of these mechanics are sourced, and they don't feel like novelties. They don't borrow from old frameworks. IE. this isn't a reskinned God of War. Nothing close.Also, because of this depth and replayability. I believe this is the best soulsborne game released yet.",1
Positive,"Why aren't you playing Bloodborne!Seriously though, this game has some of the greatest bosses in any souls game, especially the DLCs.",1

Positive,git gud or die trying,1
Positive,"Finally something challenging that made me stress and try hard to win every battle. It's the first souls game I have played but so it's a new experience for me. I was tired of all the hand-holding in ,any modern game and unless you play multiplayer games you won't find many that test your skills quite like this one (except others in the series and a few others that I can count on fingers of my one hand). I haven't completed it yet and I have two more bosses to beet (namely Nameless King and Soul of Cinder) but I really anticipate it.",1
Positive,this game is SO EASY i dont know what the corndog you guys are all on but you guys must be smokin some goooooooooood corndog if you think this game is hard. ITS SO CORNDOGGING EASY. HOLY CORNDOG why do so many people complain about how hard this easy corndogging game is. LIKE LITERALLY MADDEN NFL IS PROBABLY HARDER THAN THIS CHILDS GAME.,1
Positive,"Dark Souls is such a touchstone for the video game industry that journalists constant references to the game have become a meme. Word-of-mouth buzz and a marketing campaign led by the tagline Prepare to Die saw Dark Souls become an unlikely hit in 2011. Seven years on, the price is still being paid. There have been two sequels, an endless array of merchandise, an army of writers and video-makers dedicated to dissecting the game s mysteries and now Remaster.The game is famous for the wrong things. Dark Souls is an inversion of the kind of stories games usually tell. It constructs a meticulous dark fantasy world in which almost everything is trying to kill you. The challenge lies not in conquering it but in surviving it and trying to understand it. It is opaque, even mystical; true comprehension always feels just out of reach.For those familiar with the game, playing through again is a stark reminder of just how flabby Dark Souls imitators, and even its own sequels, have become. The world of Dark Souls is almost one landmass, with few loading screens, and the way it intricately twists around itself is an architectural feat. The spaces are cramped, the enemies placed like chess pieces. No video game world feels quite so solid, so marvellous to unravel and so plausible as Lordran.A major part of this is the weird and unsettling aesthetic. Lordran is a ruin, an abandoned remnant of what was once the gods playground. The bosses can be inscrutable monsters, but more often they are mighty wrecks of eras long gone: a giant wolf guarding her master s grave; two knights standing guard in the throne room of a desiccated reign. Eventually, you ll meet the greatest minds, the shapers of this world s history, all mad and feral.",1

Positive,"Finished main story without dlc. It feels really different from previous parts in a good way. Mobs are pretty unique from area to area and require different approach. Game really punishes you for mistakes. Level design is great, like you never get lost and have idea where to go. Lore-wise, there is a lot of references to first part. Some bosses are quite challenging. Easily best souls part for me.DLC Update:Expected to be as long as in previous parts. A bit dissapointed. Ashes of Ariandel boss is hardest bost I ever met in this series. After that boss everything feels easy xDP.S. I wish the game explained better things like: soft caps, i frames, elemental resistances and how scaling works (I only found out in elden ring that DEX buffs casting time and overall has higher scaling than STR)",1
Positive,So easy. You literally have an invincibility button you can spam every second. How do you even die,1
Positive,I must say this is a great game and will probably still be thriving up until 2024 but I have to tell the people reading this that this is not a game for casual players and that if you are a new Dark Souls player you might want to watch a few videos and tips not spoilers but tips and I remind you that this is just a great game and you should play it. I hope this was helpful and I hope to see you in he dark souls world!,1

Positive,"From Software tried to integrate almost everything criticized for Dark Souls 2 and praised for Bloodborne, and it was very successful in this masterpiece.

And the reclusive lord of the Profaned Captial, Yhorm the Giant. Only, in truth. the Lords will abandon their thrones. And the Unkindled will rise. Nameless, accursed Undead, unfit even to be cinder. And so it is, that ash seeketh embers.",1
Positive,"This is my favourite game. It's is the best game I have ever purchased, and I enjoyed my time with it. I started playing a couple years back, and it helped by being something to do in a rather unhappy time in my life. I remember coming home from late night shifts at my job, and just spending a couple hours in the evening just playing dark souls. It always felt surreal, and I found solace during those evenings.I feel that I have to mention this something. I regret attacking Hawkwood, I thought he was a bad guy. Turns out that he's just a sad guy. It was one of the only NPC's I didn't get to spend time with throughout my first playthrough. All the NPCs are well designed and have good intertwined backstories.Sometimes the Internet would stop working, and I wouldn't be able to play online. I once missed the achievement for the crystal sage because of the internet. PvP and Co-op is a pillar of the overarching Dark Souls III experience, and I have spent countless hours playing with others. I've enjoyed helping new players online, and I've enjoyed throwing dung as a Spear of the church till my opponent suffers from toxicity. Slowly but surely,I have managed to kill all the bosses in the base game solo, through patience and practice. I genuinely think that this game has been a stabilizing aspect in my life during some rough times. Nowadays, it's the game I go to when want to relax and just feel alright. I always know that I have the beautiful worlds of lothric and ariandel waiting for me when I need them.Ratings for Dark Souls III:Gameplay: 9.5 Plot: 2/10 Lore: 9/10 (To be honest, most of the time.

Positive,You are not going to win this. Foolish child Just give up,1
Positive,"It is honestly one of the first games I sunk so many hours into.The gameplay may be slow at first. You WILL die a lot first time playing this. But don't let that drag you down. The reason why so many people fall in love with the game is because of the overwhelming odds against you. Because if you don't quit and decide to overcome them no matter what, when you finally do the feeling of satisfaction is unparalleled to that of most other games.",1
Positive,"\[T]/Well its more dark souls. Now in a environment more comparable to Bloodborne.The environments are looking awesome and are huge and detailed. The level design is excellent, as in the other games, as all areas are connected to one another. The bosses have awesome desings and are way faster and ferocious. Also weapons and the different weapon arts feel a lot better. Sure the dark souls series is hard, but not as godly hard as a lot of players, especially game journalists say (except the Nameless King, but he is a optional boss so.).I played all soulsgames, except demons souls and all are challenging. But when you learn patterns and try different weapons etc. its easy. As soon as it ""clicks"", youll be faster in the next new game plus run than you expected. For me personally, pvp is always the most interesting thing anyway. Playing hide and seek during invasions, or just have some pvp fights, gets never old. The game overall feels like a huge fanservice for longtime fans of the series.DLC's:Ashes of Ariandel is a bit short. And the last boss (Sister Friede) is really the only outstanding part imo. The environments are good, but thats all.The Ringed City has one of the best environments in the game and good bossfights. It gives an impression of the grand scale of the city, but you only really visit what amounts to outskirts, what is a bit disappointing. But has one of the most annoying enemy you will ever play against, (Angels).",1
Positive,"This game helped my reaction time, not just for this game but others!That is why I recommend this game.",1

It challenges you since the beginning, but its rewarding and it grow on you, a couple deaths in and you are already hooked up, It has one of the most well designed and hardest Bosses of the series. The story its there for you to find, you must read items and read dialogs to find pieces of information, I think this add to the grueling world of darksouls.This game its a masterpiece, whenever you are fighting a boss, dodging a giant arrow on anor londo or simply invading someone on multiplayer it will leave a memorable moment.Praise the Sun!.",1

Positive,"This was my first FromSoftware game. Before going into it, I always thought Dark Souls was a franchise for people who had extreme amounts of patience and will power, but after just a few hours into the game, I could see how my thoughts couldn't be farther from the truth.This is not a game only for people with extreme reflexes, perfect eyesight and inhuman reaction times, but it's a game for people who are willing to learn from the it and adapt. Hell, I don't even have good reflexes and I was able to play it. If this is your first time playing Dark Souls, this is absolutely a good place to start.If you are having doubts about picking it up because of what you hear about difficulty, don't worry, it's not as hard as game journalists and other people make it to be. It can be hard, but only if you are not willing to adapt and learn from your mistakes.Praise the Sun!",1
Positive,"DS3 was the first souls game I've encountered and man am I stunned but how incredible the game is. I not only had an amazing experience with the game but it also introduced me to the world of SoulsBourne. Quite frankly there's nothing bad I can say about the game except maybe once in awhile the player may get lost in the maps since some of them are quite confusing if you're not great with remembering locations. Other than that, the combats are great and I love how the game allows you to have a variety of builds to choose from and that completely changes the way you play the game, but that's just the element of souls like games. Some players may get frustrated with some of the boss fights but I gotta say most of them are pretty interesting. Although the final boss (not dlc) may be a bit underwhelming after beating the nameless king, (The most fun I had with but also ironically the most I struggled with.) it was still an interesting boss fight. The lore are compelling and it really changes the way you look at some of the characters in the game. The graphics are stunning and the character designs are amazing needless to say. DS3 may not be the most challenging game in the series but I still had a blast and it truly is a timeless masterpiece.",1

It does change it up that you lose your exp (souls) when you die (if you didn't comment them.) If this was a normal game with auto-save, then people would just blast through the game.I wish the textures were of higher quality, but it is an old game at this point.

Positive,"A depressing world, inhabited by depressing characters, filled with depressing stories, accompanied by a depressing soundtrack and an even more depressing lore. Yet it is one of the best games I ever played.Dark Souls 3 is a game that doesn't tell you much about its story outright and you have to figure a lot of it out by reading item descriptions and finding hidden characters which I think is well done in this game. A lot of it is up to interpretation and some things require knowledge from previous titles but even if you don't know a thing about the story you will be able to beat the game.The bossfights and the generally high difficulty are the things Dark Souls 3 is mostly defined by people even though the other aspects are just as great.Bosses have a high difficulty, beautiful design, fun moveset and they all interact well with the world and its story.You know a boss is great when it takes you 2 hours of attempts to beat it and your first thought is ""I want to fight that boss again."".The soundtrack is mainly focused on the bossfights. Each boss has its own song that fits the mood and story. It is hard to describe the soundtrack apart from saying it is one of the best. You just have to listen to it yourself while playing the game.The RPG elements are well done but sometimes feel a bit lacking.You have a huge variety of builds due to the various weapons and stats you can use to customize your character. Many of the weapons lack a big moveset however there are also many weapons that offer fun movesets.Almost none of the ""fun"" weapons offer customization apart from upgrading its damage.You are able to use the weapon of every boss you defeated but only have a limited moveset compared to the boss who used this weapon before I still had so much fun spinning around the bossfights and areas.Your character can wear a variety of clothes and armor. Some of the sets are those the bosses used.The areas have a great design and lots of secrets which increases replayability. Graphic and artstyle make the world look so beautiful.Coop/PvP is still alive 4 years after release. It is easy to find fight clubs and you can clear areas and fight bosses together with other players. Interactions with other players are mostly friendly and honorable since most of the time people won't just run up and try to kill you unless you get invaded.Dark Souls 3 is a great game in every aspect. The game has a high difficulty, is often unforgiving and you have to figure out a lot on your own but for me it just made the experience so much better. Few games are so memorable and fun.98/100 - Would wipe this game from my memory so I can beat up old people to sad music while cosplaying as the Abyss Watchers for the first time again.",1

Positive,This game is basically Dark Souls.,1
Positive,"Well before buying this game I was pretty frightened about the game's difficulity. But I really wanted to play so I bought and saw that it's not really hard. I mean it's pretty hard but an avarage player can experience it. The most frightening part of the game is losing your souls but its not that big of a deal. First of all after you die and lose them, and if you don't die after respawning you can retrieve all of them back. And if you die before getting them you actually feel free to die becouse you have nothing to lose. So bosses are not that frightening after you die a couple of times. The game's atmosphere is so nice and eventually passing a territory is so setisfying. Enemies are usually equal with you. They usually show the same affects and responses with you. No one has any advantage against the other. That makes this game difficult. You usually feel like you are dueling with each npc. Even the lamest npcs can be really harmful. But if you concentrate enaugh and develop a strategy for each part and enemy you can beat the hell out of them and reach the other bonfire(checkpoint).The game is really much of it. And I recommend you to play online becouse this game's multiplayer is really good I think. I mean its harder to play with friends but You can leave messages and see the messages of other players wich saved my life more than a couple. But dont take them too seriusly couse some trolls leave messages that can cost you so much. And its pretty much all. I really loved this game and it seems like I'll continue playing for a while.(I did)",1

A lot of people say that Dark Souls is the hardest game series out there but if that is why you are afraid to buy this, don't be. Dark Souls is difficult, yes, but it does difficulty in a perfected and unique way. Dying can be frustrating but that is why it is so integral. It is that want to beat that boss or to clear that area that brings you to claw your way from enemy to enemy. And when you finally do this difficult task, you feel like a god. The sense of relief and joy you get from beating a hard boss is incomparable to any other game.",1
Positive,"My favorite video game series of all time, for now. If you never played any game of the series, don't listen to the talk about difficulty, it's not a rage game. I bought this game because everyone always talked about how good it was, but it wasn't my type of game. I am usually bad at dexterity-based games and didn't enjoyed difficult games. After playing it, action games became my favorite genre.The best way to describe this game or any in the series is by saying it's a journey for you, the player, and I mean you, not the character you created. You will go through an experience that might change you by the end of it, or at least change the way you see video games.Buy this game if.- You are a video games aficionado. It has legendary game design, and will definitely add something to you. It's all about the controls and gameplay.- You are an art snob. Do you like abstract storytelling or films? Everything in this game is made to evoke very specific emotions. I wouldn't call it thought provoking, just that it's very good at evoking specific feelings and causing an impression.- You are a fan of the series. This game is not like the first one. It has the best boss fights and the most polished controls of the series. Doesn't have the legendary level design of the first one or the variety of the second, but it has the best feel.Don't buy this game if.- You don't want to commit. It is the antithesis of a casual game. If you just want to turn on a game and feel good, this game won't do it for you, you have to put effort into it.",1

Can be annoying at times with the constant dying, but with that dying comes the experience to learn from your mistakes and makes you in turn stronger. Also single out enemies makes it easier. Learning boss attack patterns so that you can know when to attack/dodge/parry etc. This game is truly a gem. I have no more to say, except try it for yourself and don't give up.

Positive,"It is a lot faster than Dark Souls 1 and while it is missing some of the strengths of the first game, it is way more consistent and an excellent entry for newcomers. Much of it s identity is based on Dark Souls though and playing it before will have a great effect on appreciation for this title.(Note: This review will be only for the main game. The DLCs will be covered on their own)So Dark Souls 3 is the third of the series, but there are some interesting factors to it:1. Dark Souls 2 was not made by Hidetaka Miyazaki and with Dark Souls 3 he made his glorious return. Dark Souls 2 is still the black sheep of the series and his influence was greatly needed.2. In the meantime he had worked on Bloodborne and many creative ideas and design choices from that game influenced Dark Souls 3, making it a somewhat fresh experience.3. There is no third bullet point. I really just wanted to use the number 3.And here we go again:Dark Souls is based on combat that focuses on just a small number of enemies at the same time. You got your weapon, a dodge roll and maybe a shield in your left hand. If you ever saw the gameplay of any soulsborne game: There is absolutely no change that is really noteworthy in the fundamentals. Yet still everything changed by one thing that penetrates the whole game, if you compare it to the titles that came before:Dark Souls 3 is really fast. After coming from Dark Souls 1 I realized that many things I had learned were still applicable, but I needed to train my reflexes to catch up with the enemies. This was quite the experience and another learning experience also reached me really fast:Shields are not good and you will want to dodge as often as you can.This was quite frustrating and I still think that stacking defense and trying to go for well timed blocks is another strategy that at least should be viable. Although armor provides stats, most of the time it is pretty useless to go for any better armor. Rip tank build, at least I dearly miss you.Here a link to explain some of the problems (math heavy)https://www.giantbomb.com/profile/ltsquigs/blog/dark-souls-3-breaking-the-tank/113034/So we sacrificed at lot, but what did we get for it?The best bosses and areas in the series in terms of fighting. Dark Souls had hiccups and places like Lost Izalith were absolutely atrocious, because of a rushed production. Dark Souls 2 is just a rushed game that did get many things wrong.Let me tell you two things.First thing: Every boss has a second phase which makes any encounter even more epic. Not all of them are fair and sometimes they will kill you in a cheap way. Most of the time they enrich the fight and the former of the weakness of the boss gets covered. So you always need to think about how to properly react and never get cocky.Second thing: The areas themselves are well designed. You do not get spammed with enemies and their placement feels natural. Often I tried to think about how to engage the group ahead, before I initiated the fight which gave another layer to the combat. Musashi would be proud.The design and atmosphere still absolutely hit the right beats and Miyazaki found even more color palettes. Cold ice can combine with religious medieval churches or a castle with it s defensive and functional mechanisms has been overrun by undead so that it feels lifeless and full of dangers. If I had to criticize anything I would argue that there is overabundance of blue and white while green, yellow and red are somewhat underutilized (in the case of red it makes sense from a narrative standpoint, however it takes from the design of areas).The enemies themselves have improved most of the time, but I was sometimes missing that sense of grandiosity or surprise. Dark Souls 3 is absolutely the most consistent and also the least unique. Some designs just feel really safe and combined with borrowing identity from the first game the feeling of encountering something absolutely unique is not encountered as often. This is absolutely nitpicking, I just wanted to express this.There is just one thing that really annoys me:The areas are just too excessive and not as interconnected as in Dark Souls 1. This meant that I had a really hard time to memorize anything about any area in any form. I still could draw a map of the first game, because everything was more or less really organized and no map was bigger than it needed to be. Dark Souls 3 may be more authentic, but for me it was just more tedious.Dark Souls game/10Would recommend again watching VaatiVidya every single day.Yet again it proves to be the weak point of the series. Honestly I could not really recount any track from the game and say which boss/area it belongs to (except one ofc). This is honestly somewhat disappointing and bored me. Maybe the idea is to not use music excessively to not overshadow the gameplay itself, maybe there is another reason I am not seeing. Still I can t bring myself to praise anything about this OST except the good execution.Dark Souls 3 is a great game and offers the most well rounded experience from any Dark Souls game. Dark Souls 1 suffers from a quality of decline after the first half, Dark Souls 2 has made many things broken that were not in the first game. In the end I am perfectly fine with the game and I felt satisfied beating the boss. It just did not hit the same highs I had when I played the first one. Maybe my expectations were wrong or too high. In the end I am not disappointed, just not really impressed either.If you liked this review, make sure to check out my curator page at https://store.steampowered.com/curator/31884377-If-It-Is-Insane/Thanks for reading",1

Positive,It's a good game.,1
Positive,"Note: I have spent a good chunk of time playing this game on another platform prior to playing it on PC. I also compare this game to previous ones in the series a bit. Good Aspects+++ One of the best (possibly the best) combat systems I've experienced in an Action-RPG. If you get hit it feels like your own fault. If you land a hit it feels like you outsmarted your opponent. When you defeat a boss it feels overwhelmingly satisfying.++ A ridiculously huge variety in terms of weapons, weapon movesets, armor, spells, etc. You can make all kinds of different builds for your character.++ A hauntingly beautiful soundtrack that inspires you to not back down.+ Playing online - both for co-operative play and PvP - has seen huge improvements in comparison to previous titles in the series. Faith-based healing builds feel much more viable now and chain backstabbing from the first Dark Souls isn't an issue anymore, for example.+ Parrying/Riposting feels the most satisfying it has ever felt in the Souls series. Mixed Aspects~ Weapon Arts: while these give weapons more of a sense of unique identity they aren't as balanced as they could be (some are just flat out better than others). A bit more variety with the weapon arts themselves would've also been nice but this isn't nearly as noticeable of an issue as the first.~ Estus Shards/Undead Bone Shards: while I personally prefer this system in comparison to the first Dark Souls an argument could be made that you still get too much of it. This feels okay to me due to the balancing nature between normal estus and ashen estus flasks (to restore FP for weapon arts and magic) but it's worth mentioning.~ The world design is fairly linear with how you proceed through the various areas. Previous games in the series had varying levels of ""Metroidvania"" elements to them that are mostly lacking here. You can still do certain things in a different order but it's not nearly as common an occurrence.Bad Aspects- Power Stance from Dark Souls 2 is gone. This is somewhat made up for with the dual wielding weapons but it doesn't have the same versatility.- The game relies a little too much on previous games in regard to weapons, armor, and lore to stand completely on its own. This is a fairly minor issue and could be seen as a pretty controversial statement so I will not elaborate on it further, however.Score: 10/10",1

The story is deep and its really hard to figure out the lore but thanks to youtube videos and theories, it was possible to understand it without effort. It starts off confusing and difficult but once you get the hang of it you'll get addicted. Also this game is known for its hard boss fights and it is possible to die more than 20 times to a boss but once you kill them, the satisfaction is insane lol. There are a looooot of things the game doesn't teach you right away and you'll have to experiment to find out stuff. I'd recommend this game to anyone who doesn't give up easily.",1

Positive,"I got myself into the Dark Souls franchise when I played the remastered version of the first game for Switch, it was the first time I played a game like this, an enticing experience that captivated the player with such a beautiful environment, a great story and a challenging difficulty. After finishing the first game I felt somewhat empty and hungry for a similar experience, knowing that there were 3 Souls games but with not so much money I was really happy to find this game on discount, and when I played it, man it really is an amazing game. so much places to explore, so much attention to detail and the story that just kept on giving, I saw the return of NPCs that were on the first game and I was charmed by the Firelink keeper, the variety of weapons and the skills they had for each one, dialogues with the bosses when you both lose or finally beat them after several tries kept me captivated. This game was also the first one that even after several years of its release I was able to enjoy it online playing against and cooperating with other players, I sure am glad that there's still a community that keeps on playing it. I've finished my first playthrough completing all of the bosses and left my character at the Firelink Shrine of my second journey, I'll be sure to return one day to experience again this amazing journey.

Positive,"This is a game i truly did not think i'd enjoy, a scenario that is rather common amongst the sekisoulsborne fan/player-base. it's just such a well crafted (except for the Shrek part(s), fuck swamps, fatrolling around a large area with like 15 enemies scattered about isn't a challenge, its stupid and grows more and more obnoxious on each subsequent playthrough) experience that i'd absolutely recommend it to anyone willing to put anywhere from 40 to 1000 hours into struggling through this incontestably shining gem of a game only to look back and see just how far you've actually come in terms of skill and understanding (if you actually try to get better that is, getting assistance for certain bosses or encounters is an option i myself used on several occasions through my 1st almost completely blind playthrough, I haven't since then due to my gradual increase in skill level, plus the Astora Ultra Great Sword helped out a little bit i gueeeeeeess lmao (I legit had no idea it was meta for PvE until I was checking the wiki for info on builds and misc stuff on my NG +1 run) It goes without saying that Dark Souls isn't a game franchise for everyone blah blah some wont even make it past the first boss (I gave my sister the best starter ""class"" and an hour to beat Iudex Gundyr. she left my room 55 minutes in, never making it past phase 1) and end up calling it quits or refunding the game if able, in some cases they go on to decry FROM SOFTWARE for their game design and difficulty, a viewpoint I found (and still find) to be completely idotic if you understand the purpose behind why they make the games they do the way they do. I'm getting way off topic. Anyways, the game may not always be completely fair, you may get lost in a level or section for waaaaay longer than you should, you'll die a F*CKTON on your first run through the game and a good portion of that 30-50 hour runtime WILL be spent running past the same enemies over and over and over and the sooner you accept this reality, the sooner you'll get the fun part, actually realizing how much progress you've made thus far and probably simultaneously realizing how much more you'll have to deal with until you beat up the final big bad. tbh idk if anything i said makes sense or if it even works as a way to get you to buy it and rn i dont feel like re typing this at all. so im ending it off here.Very good, Very challenging, Veeery fun, Very swamp wai- GODDAMMIT!

Nope I don't think so.A lot of action RPG in highest difficulty is harder than DS ( like GoW )Not to mention in DS you can choose to fight or flee when encounter strong enemies(except bosses)DS reward player who thinks before action and pay attention to details while punish HARD to those running around like a brain dead hollow.Boss fights & Musics :Oh my, it's just unfair how astonishing those experiences can be compare to other games.IDK how to describe it but when the second phase (or third :) ) of boss theme kicks in the feeling of adrenaline flows through your veins is just AWESOME.If DS says it has the second best boss fights probably only Sekiro has the balls to claim he's the best.Last part : AtmosphereDarksouls' graphic is BAD, even GoW running on PS4 looks better than DS running high with reshade on PC.But i'll still give visual experience a 8/10 because the art style and the atmosphere is just PERFECT.You can really feel the world is slowly dying and everything seems to have no hope.You are tasked on an impossible mission to achieve god knows what.Hostile environments and deadly enemies / traps make you want to give up.Some did and became Hollow.But if you try once again, the bonfire might just be at the next corner.The constant pressure from the atmosphere is what makes this game good,but the relief after you reached the next bonfire is what makes it perfect.No matter how dark it is, there's still bright lights from the fire make you keep going.Conclusion:Dark souls pretty much murdered every other action RPG games except BOTW and GoW for me.I'll give it a solid 10/10 for offline, 9/10 for online because kinda broken matching system.Good luck fighting a +10 everything SL10 tryhard at the early stage of game.",1

Positive,Have to say Dark Souls 3 is a masterpiece with incredible graphics and animations.And the story line is obscure but attractive.Love this game.,1
Positive,This game is so hard its angering. i cant deal with this people invading me all the time. these bosses are to hard to fight. Why make a game that takes 400 hours to beat? It doesnt make sense. 10/10 would recommend.,1
Positive,Kaksin k sin ll bozolle,1
Positive,"Probably one of the better games I've played. There isn't really a defined gameplay style/type everybody follows in this one, (considering that shields aren't ridiculously overpowered this time), and there are a lot of references to other Souls games, like the Washing Pole and the Uchigatana. The gameplay is really polished, and the bosses have very well designed movesets and attacks. Also, to anybody giving this game a bad review (I know they're not common but they happen) because they can't get past the first boss, this isn't the game for you. That boss is probably one of the easiest ones in the game, the only easier I can think of being Deacons of the Deep. (This aint flaming or insulting, its simply warning people of the dangers ahead. Mods dont kill me)",1
Positive,"Best game I ever played at.At least this is the perfect lieBecause this ain't the best souls part of the series, but a pretty good partThis is only my opinionMy favourite part is Bloodborne (In the souls series: DS2)But very nice to play, better than playing online MP games, with full toxic kidsIf you die, obviously that'll be your fault in 95%The other 5 is just the game's bullshitBut actually one of my favourite gamesI'm a bit disappointed, cuz there won't be any other souls game in the series, in the futureBut for a finish, perfect.Oh, one more thingIf you finished playing the vanilla, and you beat the DLCs too (if you buy them)Try some other mods from nexusmodsI recommend Cinders and Champion's AshesI think these are the best mods.Thank you for reading, mays't thou thy peace discover!",1
Positive,"my third favorite game and, one of the most well made games of all time. perfectly conveys the themes of the series while maintaining staples without feeling overly intrusive or retreading too much on old ground. perfected the combat the souls series has been working on within all the games, bringing elements from bloodborne, with faster paced combat and healing while moving, to create a much better flowing system then any souls-like before it. some elements of the combat (as of 3/6/22) are better than elden ring's combat system, with things like katanas not returning to sheathed mode when using the combat art and holding LT in ER. the pvp in this game is the best part, facing off against other players for souls is an amazing experience which allows for growth on playstyle, experimentation with playstyles, giving more variety to gameplay and making things much less predictable in a game which can often be repetitive (if youre bad). for me this game will remain the definitive dark souls game, even if it is not as groundbreaking or genre defining as the first, it is the truest dark souls game. 10/10",1

Positive,yes if ur depressed it makes u moire depressed and it cancels it out so then u feel nothing,1
Positive,"Dark Souls III is a game that will truly be able to stand the test of time.Take on the role of the Ashen One, a soul who is destined to overthrow the Lords of Cinder in order to save the world and prevent the darkness once and for all. Or will they?Become a Knight, a Sorcerer, a Pyromancer, an Assassin. whoever you want to be! Dark Souls III has so many weapon, armour and ring choices that you can play the game how you want to, and spend souls to level up the character the way you want.The appearance of Dark Souls III is truly a sight to behold. From Software did a fantastic job at being able to capture what a cursed and rotting dark-fantasy world would look like. Ready the screenshots!When it comes to the question of PvP, it's usually a game of who's more experienced or who has a higher soul level. Of course, this isn't to say that all high level players are professional gamers, but they may have a significantly increased chance of survival (typically because of higher HP/Stamina). Same goes for experienced players on new characters and players with strong weapons/armour.Story-wise, the game has amazing lore and a strong story that can still be theorized about to this day. The PvE in Dark Souls III can be frustrating at times, but if you persevere, you will overcome. There's a reason why the Souls games are considered some of the most difficult games in the world!Overall, I would strongly recommend this game for anyone who is looking for a fun, challenging, adventurous dark-fantasy escape.",1
Positive,easy peasy would recommend easy game.,1
Positive,"Dark Souls III is a great souls game with lots of depth and replay value. Lots of PVP and coop PVE opportunities. DS3 is different is various ways, some for better some for worse. The poise system from DS1 is no longer in place, instead poise comes mostly from weapons and is only in place during certain swinging animations. I preferred the poise system of DS1 personally. Enemy design is a bit different in DS3 than DS1-all the enemies (including hollows) are always close to twice as tall as the player, which I think is a means to make the player feel small and fragile. But I think the design was still a bit superior in DS1. But at it's core it's still a souls game. It's fun to play definitely worth the purchase, though there may be times of frustration.",1
Positive,super good game i would love for more dlcs and extensions and for bloodborne on pc immediately+elden ring release this year and make it harder and gangster thanks ill pay the 80 dollars for the game friends at fromsoftware! pls more dlc for ds3 pls pls will pay cash,1

Completely fell in love with the game.The story and music is absolutely amazing, the scenery is breathtaking and the feeling of finally defeating that one boss you were struggling with for so long is epic.You will not regret playing it :)",1
Positive,"First time playing a souls game and really loved it. Played co-op with a veteran friend wherever it was possible on my first run so got a good hang of the game without getting brutally punished. The game is tough and punishing, but it always makes you come back for more. Cons Half baked support for keyboard+mouse mapping. On Screen instructions are displayed for controllers everywhere and takes while to get used to if you are playing with Keyboard+mouse.",1
Positive,"First playthrough: (when it realeased) verry good game, the difficulty isnt that hard compared to the others, i completed the game in about the first 8-9 hours, alot of helpful guides online and fun builds you can try out, playing it with friends is also avalable which is fun, i personally am banned from multiplayer, beaucse after a while i began using exploits, and got abnormal stats on my character which got me banned, not salty well deserved, overall fun and good game, out of all the games this one is a solid 2nd place 8/10edit: (67 Hours) I went back to play this again and i got my ass kicked, like everyboss tok atleast 4-5 hours atleast and i hated every moment of it, BUT it was fun and challenging and i still havent beaten that playthrough lmaoedit 2: (210 hours) after seing my game being reset and just playing arround until like 120 hours ish, i took it upon myself to finish what i started in my second playtrough, i hopped on twitch and this game i beat the game with bosses taking average of FIRST timing the to maybe 10-15 minutes, i finally beat all the bosses i struggled with (twin princes and nameless king), i must say after finishing it i felt empty as i had completed what was a bane in my existence, i would recommend this game for anyone interested in great lore, views and scenes, and near perfect boss music and design, yes this game has alot of random bullshit that kills you but when finishing it, euphoria hits. plan is to start streaming the dlc and see if i can beat the bosses therewill stream it ofc at {LINK REMOVED}(Twitch.tv/PurpleRexbot).Edit 3: (270 hours) After coming back to this game on my 24 hour stream, to get all the endings AND playing the DLC this is my favorite game of all time, All the bosses are well designed, their individual arenas and soundtrack compliment them so well and the soundtrack reflects the bosses past and what they have been through, even the past of the npcs and their quest are amazing and tie in great to your runs!you can easily build whatever you want and complete the game, as everything works, even a broken straight sword, the art style also compliments this game so well, entering Irithyll for the 1st time 2nd time 3rd time, it never gets old, i always stop to take in the gorgeous views and design of this game, this game will always be close to my heart 10/10 changed my life.",1

Positive,"The ultimate masterpiece.Ah, Dark Souls. What can I tell you about Dark Souls III? One could not tell the brilliance of Dark Souls without embracing it. I can tell you about the amazing world, the magnificent creatures and the incredible storytelling. Yet, if you truly want to experience the Dark Souls, you have to dive into it and embrace it as a part of your own. Through misery, seek happiness.The amazing world, the magnificent creatures, the incredible storytelling, those are a part of the Dark Souls experience. However, they are not the most important factors. The most important element is the notion of living. We are living in a world full of technology, full of supplies, full of entertainment to the point of abundance. Yet, we couldn't help but feeling so useless, so helpless trying to stay alive sometimes. Fyodor Dostoevsky once said The mystery of human existence lies not in just staying alive, but in finding something to live for. Are you living your life, truly? We are nothing but a mere rock on the road, whatever happens to us, does not matter in the grand scheme of the universe. Then what are we living for?Through the lens of Dark Souls, a world without hope, we can finally seek an answer to that question. You found yourself in a depressing world, filled with monsters made out of ""hollow"" people, those who lost the will to live. You are told to slay all the Lords of Cinders to become a great being to link the fire, in an attempt to better this world. But, when you look at this world, this depressing world, do you still want to link the fire, you question yourself. After you kill demons, lords, princes, gods, in the end, how does it feel like? After 15 seconds of feeling proud of your achievements, ultimately it does not matter. You trample on other beings to gain your power, to finally link the fire, yet this act is futile. Fire fades, darkness rises. You have been trying so hard to finally achieve a futile goal to save a worthless world. In the end, nothing even matters, even your existence.I can relate a lot to Albert Camus's ""The Myth of Sisyphus"" after playing Dark Souls. Much like our existence in the real world, our existence in the Dark Souls world does not matter at all. It's a futile act, trying to roll a boulder up a hill, only for it to fall down and do the act entirely again. However, if you take on another perspective, maybe like Sisyphus learn to enjoy the mere act of rolling the stone, we could as well find meanings in this futile world. You can find people in the Dark Souls world so precious that you want to save them. You can find corners of beauty lurking in this worthlessly hopeless world. You can finally enjoy yourself, even if they are only small things. Just like in real life, Dark Souls is the path to find yourself and your position in the world. You will experience misery, suffering to the point of wanting to kill yourself. But, LIVE! ""Live!"" is the only thing Dark Souls taught me, yet this simple thing is the core essence of everything. To live is to not go hollow, to live is to find yourself in this world, to live is to finally find a purpose for yourself, not just staying alive.Don't you dare go hollow.Yuu Raskolnikov",1

Positive,Ds3 is the best in the series for me <3 bosses r too good and memorable. Praise the Sun !,1
Positive,"Dark Souls 3 is my absolute favourite game, I played it hundreds of hours on the PS4 and just had to get it on PC for some challenge runs. It's fast paced combat and (for beginners) challenging difficulty is even after over assumably 900 hours of playtime still fun to me. I can also highly recommend all the other games in the Soulsborne series.",1

Positive,This is not for casual players i can say that i didn't play the first 2 dark souls games. I want to say games combat mechs are really good but everyone knows that and storyline is not a simple thing to know if you know games origins you'll not regret to buy it.,1

Don't have something representative for that class, just the starting items that you can buy/farm later.Overall is a worth to play game.",1
Positive,"DarkSouls III is very different from its predecessors for the simple reason that the level design is much more linear than in previous games. And that makes the experience more enjoyable from my point of view, even though I loved the first and second games in the license. Apart from that, everything that makes the DarkSouls license what it is, is found in this one, only more accomplished. The game looks great, the gameplay is fun and customizable. Battles, bosses, level design, attacks, staging, cinematics, bestiary, quests, pnjs. Everything is mastered to perfection. The feeling of power is crescendo and the DLC is overpowering. The experience is concentrated (unlike Elden Ring) and each new encounter brings its own share of excitement. It would be even better if, during cooperative play sessions, the game recorded progress for all players. And if the quests gave more hints. Thank you for porting BloodBorne to PC. 20/20",1

Positive,good game first time through and love the twin princes swords you can combine on second play through but there's little to no replay-ability.The multiplayer is decent too and i find (at least right now) there's not allot of hackers. 8/10 would be 10/10 if there where maybe more boss swords and items you could combine to make something good but hey its a solid game deffoes worth full price but if you wait for discount its way better for the value,1

Even after finishing the game I keep coming back to it to play it with friends, or just to learn new things about the lore of the game, which there is so much of. Basically, if you like RPGs, enjoyed the first Souls games, and are up for a challenge, I definitely recommend this game.",1
Positive,"I have been playing since Demon's Souls, and I have grown an emotional attachment to these games. I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND this game and any of the Souls-borne games to anyone looking for a difficult game. The difficulty is perfectly balanced, it's not cheap difficulty but it is possible if you try.",1
Positive,"My favourite game that is currently available on Steam. A flawed masterpiece with amazing combat, and some of the best bosses and soundtracks I have ever experienced. The lore is also one of my favourites, I pretty much love everything about this game, I have very few gripes about it. Definitely a must play.",1

Positive,It's an amazing game! \[T]/,1
Positive,yeah its pretty good,1
Positive,playing this game is an emotional car crash,1
Positive,"Dark souls 1 is a video game that proves that games can be art, and it is a masterpiece. Dark Souls 3 never quite reaches that level in design. However, Dark Souls 3 does have tighter controls, and more fluid combat that leads to it being a more fun gaming experience that can be replayed many times. It's also easier to introduce your friends to the genre with this one.",1
Positive,"This game is a technical masterpiece. From game play to atmosphere, Dark Souls reigns supreme and puts other action/rpg titles to shame. It has been years since the latest instalments release, yet no game developer outside of FromSoftware has been able to replicate the things that make this series so compelling. Would I recommend playing it? No. God no. This game is not 'fun'; only a masochist would actually take pleasure in playing this game. I have finished this game 3 times on Xbox and have almost completed it here on PC (just defeated the NK). Playing Dark Souls is not what a normal person would consider 'fun'. I only play it because it is unique and because of the satisfaction it provides once I have overcome a particular boss. The fact of the matter is that this game is much to frustrating for a casual audience to enjoy. No matter how highly you regard something, no matter how fantastic the product is; no rational person would stake anything significant in betting that a stranger would enjoy Dark Souls 3. If you are an extremely patient person, play this game. If you are looking for the best single player action RPG the industry has to offer, play this game. If you are a masochist who likes to be outmatched constantly, play this game. If not, do not bother. It will only be bitter. tldr: Is it a great game? Yes. Would I recommend it to you? Probably not.",1
Positive,Best Souls game in my opinion. Has the best from Dark Souls 1 improved to be funnier to play and re-play. Fantastic lore and game mechanics. Almost endless possibilities to play the game. PvP is fun and there is still people playing the game.,1
Positive,"Truly, like it's predecessors, a masterpiece. If you love challenge, fluid combat, amazing world building and Dark Fantasy, then this game is for you! Thanks to many different weapons and spells, the game never feels the same if you decide to try out a new build and play it again. Nowadays it's rare to find a game with this much replayability. Also fun as a co-op game with friends!",1
Positive,One of my favourite game ! best way to enter the souls serie for me.,1
Positive,Finally im able to play this masterpiece properlyGreat Franchise <3 hopin to see Demon Souls comin to Steam someday,1
Positive,"I have played this game on all consoles and on the PC. With that in mind when I say this game is good. I mean it! There is so much to do in this game and the two DLC make it even better. Say, do you want to make a character who whips people to death while also making fountains of lava erupt from the ground? You can! Do you want to make a serious character with a cool backstory who uses a rapier infused with crystals? Yet again, you can. Do you want to be Zeus and Conjure up A GODDAMN LIGHTNING STORM ALL WHILE LOOKING LIKE AN ACTUAL ONION INFUSED KNIGHT?! you already know what the answer is. HELL YEAH! I guess what i'm saying is yeah the community can be really toxic and yeah the bosses can be hard at times but I feel as someone with an over 1000 hours (If you didn't remember I also played on Xbox and PS4) that this game is one of the most addicting, fun, creative, and really funny at times. This is also not even the hardest game in the series so if you are looking for a really big challenge try out Dark Souls 1 as well as this. I really hope this helps someone decide on whether they should get this or not. Good luck if you do buy it and its your first time. Because you WILL need it.",1
Positive,"If you hate long hand-holding tutorials and yourself, then this is the perfect game for you!",1
Positive,I'm just speechless,1
Positive,"I've wasted so many hours of my life on this game and I don't regret a second of it - I'm sure I'll waste many more on this, too. Amazing gameplay with so many different playstyles that somehow all intertwine into a balanced PvP system while keeping the game enjoyable and difficult enough to make me exit the game in a rage but quickly restart within a few minutes.

All 3 games are masterpieces when you include their DLC content.btw.NO PAY TO WIN.NO MICROTRANSACTIONS.From Software created a whole new genre with these gems and you won't regret playing. Have patience as you learn the mechanics.and understand that nothing is explained. I recommend struggling through the 1st playthrough and looking at guides for the rest.,1

Instantly started off dying over and over again and at some point I had enough but playing the game more and more made me realize that without dying and losing souls constantly the game isn't played right.

Positive,"There's a reason this game has its own sort of genre (SOULS) because as an RPG game, this may not appeal to many. Dark Souls is a game that either clicks with you or it doesn't. You first of all should have a controller bc KB bindings are ass. You play the role of an ""unkindled ash"" who is basically seen as a peasant and you have to bring the Lords of Cinder to their throne by brute force to break the curse of your kind. Story exists but it's mostly given in terms of lore so you're actually playing a game, not watching a movie. You roll to evade attacks with invincibility frames (or can block using a shield, costing you stamina) or parry an attack, enabling you to land a critical hit and then offend using a strong attack, light attack or special attack. And that's it. You go through many areas fighting some weak skeleton mobs or witches, to face a more dangerous mob, such as a knight, to then go to a boss fight where you could either breeze through it or respawn at the closest bonfire and get your ass handed to you 30 times. 19 bosses excl DLC or 26 incl DLC, and some of the bosses are actually fantastic. If you embrace yourself in to the atmosphere, this game is scary, difficult and exciting Dark Souls is a game, though, where you know nothing so maybe a few videos might help you understand how to upgrade your weapons and healing. The areas have a foreboding atmosphere, the music is very orchestral with choir and chants (hee haw hee) so if you're in to that, then the music is stellar, the boss fights are amazing, the enemies are meh, the story is kind of deep but it's just lore and the game is fun. It's a crazy experience where you start off raging and end up appreciating the journey. Took me probs 70 hours to beat the main game and DLC since I died a lot and explored the areas. Huge game. I would recommend, NOT to all but to some. For me personally, outstanding fucking game, one of my favs of all time",1

Positive,"DS3 is a game of valleys and peaks, down through dungeons and up over castle walls. It's a plummet into places we shouldn't be-an escape from places we don't belong.But of course, we fight our way through the darkness, and find our way out. There are a few stumbles along the way, but in the end, Dark Souls III is well worth the riveting climb.This is the third in a series of dark fantasy role-playing games known for their brutal difficulty and unforgiving nature. It gives minimal direction and little room for error. As with its predecessors, playing Dark Souls III means accepting two extremes: recurring defeat, and the reward of breaking through it. This is a game that recognizes the value of perseverance, tearing you down before it pulls you back up, reinforcing the spots where it broke you, preparing you for that next valley just down the road.The world itself is a disconnected series of detailed areas-some sprawl outward, while others stack on top of themselves, folding back and looping around in intricate webs. It's a testament to the level design that discovering a bonfire checkpoint is as important as levelling your character or defeating a challenging boss. In this dangerous world of swamps, prisons, and undead villages, every milestone is a victory.Returning to the Firelink Shrine hub world in order to level up character stats, weapon quality, and the health-imbuing estus flask seems tedious at first, but as time goes by, you'll recruit helpful companions that set up camp at your base, granting useful items and buffs throughout your playthrough. Bonfire checkpoints strewn throughout Dark Souls III allow for easy fast travel, and returning to Firelink becomes a welcome reprieve from the surrounding world.This macabre locale has subtle stories to tell-enemies on the Road of Sacrifices behave defensively, only attacking once attacked. Giants bow their heads in exhaustion among the rafters of the Cathedral of the Deep. A sense of mystery pervades Dark Souls III's gloomy world, and there's a confidence on display that's often missing from many modern games-Dark Souls III has secrets, whether you find them or not.It's also impressive how Dark Souls III strikes a balance between exploration and guidance. There's usually more than one path you can take through the world at any time-to new bosses, secret dungeons, or new areas entirely-but never too many that it feels overwhelming. The level design encourages wandering without losing focus.Obstacles come in a variety of grotesque forms along the way: hulking giants and feral dogs; ancient knights and suicidal monks. Each enemy is a unique threat, and in groups, they grow more dynamic and punishing, demanding a flexible approach to combat. Dark Souls III is also clever in the way it plays on your false sense of comfort: many deaths come when you underestimate an enemy you've killed dozens of times before. The danger is always lurking. In the long run, survival requires patience.This is true throughout-there's a certain cadence to the combat, a certain pattern to each enemy, that's only discernible when you take time to observe it. Some enemies are weak near their sword arm-others are vulnerable from behind. Instinct may tell you to dodge every time a knight retracts its spear, but wasting stamina could lead to a quick death, forcing a restart at the most recent bonfire. Dark Souls III doesn't just teach you new skills-it forces you to forget ones you've already learned.The combat fluctuates between measured duels and frantic fights, but it almost always manages to keep things fair: you may be outnumbered and underpowered, but defeat is usually your fault. Sometimes, however, Dark Souls III breaks that rule. The camera often struggles to adjust in tight spaces, and the lock-on mechanic can be capricious, especially against Dark Souls III's more mobile, aggressive enemies. In boss fights that require precision, an imprecise camera becomes all the more of a hindrance.But what impressive monstrosities these bosses can be. In fact, several display more creativity than any others in developer From Software's RPG lineup. These creatures play on your expectations and force you to adapt. One boss fight pits you against a crowd of pyromancers that inches toward you, hinting at its weakness with subtle visual cues. Intuition tells you to keep your distance, but it soon becomes clear you'll need to enter the fray. It rips you out of your comfort zone at a harrowing pace.Despite the nuance and novelty of most bosses, however, some stick to familiar ground. Deja vu kicks in during several fights, when the monsters display move sets similar to those that came before them, diminishing the creativity displayed elsewhere. I brought down Pontiff Sullyvahn, the Consumed King, and even Aldrich-a boss the game purports to be one of my major targets-with tactics I had used hours earlier. These enemies feel recycled. They feel repetitive. The skin may be different, but the beast remains the same.One glaring design misstep involves a boss requiring a specific item to bring him down-that is, if you don't want to spend half an hour whittling away at his health. There is an earlier, obscure side quest that removes the need to use that item. But many players might not stumble upon it. Dark Souls is at its best when it rewards your growth, and tests your character's hard-earned experience. This boss fight doesn't-it has a very specific solution, despite the path you've taken to get there. This enemy, and the repetitive bosses, fly in the face of the progress you've made. They repeat patterns you've already mastered.So too does the overall level design of the late-game hours. Whereas most of Dark Souls III makes uses of labyrinthine corridors and trap-laden outdoor settings, these areas lose their design appeal as the game comes to a close. I expected Dark Souls III to carry me through imaginative fights and engaging treks as my character reached the apex of her skills, but instead I felt disappointed. I had come all this way with her, and aside from two fantastic end-game bosses and a handful of inventive secret areas in its waning hours, Dark Souls III seemed not to erupt, but rather, fade slowly into the fog.But by and large, your growth is respected. It's that thread-that near constant sense of progress-that leads to Dark Souls III's greatest moments. We create our travelers. We make them stronger, faster, more resilient, turning them into fighters as we too learn the intricacies of this foreboding world. We can't slay the final boss until we conquer every enemy before it, so by the end of Dark Souls III, we've truly mastered something. That's a special feeling.",1

Positive,"Fun game to play and very rewarding to ""git gud"" at. You will find yourself wanting to pull your hair out on numerous occasions, however. The game teaches you a lot of important skills that will help you in your normal life. Patience, awareness, resolve, perseverance, and stress resistance. After putting in some hours you will see yourself improving as well as your equipment. There are so many builds that you can go for in terms of leveling, weapons, and armor that you select. This game has great replayability, co-op, and PvP. Very in-depth in terms of lore and gameplay. There is never a dull moment in this game and it will always keep you on your toes. On top of all of this, this game has amazing graphics that still holds strong after being released 3 years ago. It's on sale right now, so give it a try!",1

I loved completing the game with different builds, I loved playing for speedruns and I still love hanging around invading people or helping them. Every time I don't have a new game that catches me I come back here and I know I will enjoy every minute. This is my favourite game of all time.",1
Positive,"I love this game, and I'll tell you why I recommend it but let me tell you something 1st.The Online Aspect and PVP is very hit or miss now. Invading, and or being invaded takes ages and that comes with a majority of the player base leaving. I often times will wait 5 minutes or more to finally get an invasion in the most common invasion places such as Pon Sullivan. Having this said there are some things they should have improved upon with the pvp but overall I enjoy it.Now, with that being said the core game is absolutely fantastic. The Lore is extremely deep and interesting, the bosses are by far my favorite in any other game ever, and the amount of variety of which you can customize and change your character in every sense is the best I've ever seen. The Graphics are beautiful as hell, and most of the areas are extremely fun and interesting with few exceptions. Overall If you want to dive into this game you need to dive deep if you aren't ready for that then don't play it. It's one of my favorite games of all Time.Overall Rate - 9.4/10",1

Though it's anti-cheat system needs work since it can ban non-hacking players, here's hoping Elden Ring isn't like this though.",1

Positive,10/10 Played in PS4 and came to PC. I love this game everything about it yeah the controllers are funky because was set to be with a controller but don't let that discourage you!,1
Positive,"I played every game in the Souls series (including Demon's Souls) and this is my favourite.The level design is incredible, every place you see is a place you can go. The story. well, I'm not going to pretend that I understood all of it, but I like the puzzling on your own aspect of it. I understand if that is a deal breaker to players who like a more dialogue heavy RPG. The PVP is better, it fells more balanced than the other entries in the series (I still suck at it though). The worst part is, by far, the covenants. The grind for the covenant items is a very long ordeal and it's required for getting all of the achievements. Co-op has improved, you can summon your friends more easily now by setting a common password between players in the game settings. The combat is the same, but all weapons now have weapon arts, which adds another layer of strategy to the game. There is a large variety of weapons that suits various different playstyles, and they are well balanced, I believe all them are a viable option to finish the game. The spells are there, but I must admit that I didn't play much with them.All in all, this game looks like a refinement of all of the elements of the previous games. They picked the best features and implemented them with different levels of success. The game feels easier, but I think it's because I really got better at playing it during all this time, the challenge is still there but now I know what to look out for when in a dire situation. It's about having the patience to learn the patterns and react accordingly not rushing in flailing about with your weapon. Once you learn this, all the games in this series will be a lot easier.",1

Positive,"If you want a game you can really sink your teeth into, look no further. It is the epitome of a ""Choose your own difficulty game"". Feel free to go in with nothing more than rags, a wooden club and a fistful of determination. Or if that doesn't float your boat, grind and level up you stats and weapons so every boss is a breeze, it is really up to you. If you want the ""Dark Souls experience"", I would recommend going in blind without guides or hints to truly experience the brilliance put into the level and character design. It is a breath of fresh air from the modern titles that are shallow and unfinished. The RPG elements offered really immerse you into this fantastical yet believable universe FromSoftware have crafted and keep you hooked in and devoted to your play through. Each new area begs the question: ""Where's the next bonfire?"", ""Is their a hidden item over there?"",""When is the next boss?"". This was the first Soulsborne game I have played, but it certainly won't be the last. 10/10.",1

Positive,"It's time to tell a little bit about Dark Souls 3. So when I first met the Dark Souls series, it was the second part, I played with pleasure and I liked it, but the first part was not finished. That's why I played the third part. Dark Souls captured me with their fight, climate and history that lies behind all the missiles and which we can discover or completely put down and think that we are here to kill. Focusing on Dark Souls 3, it is a bit different from the previous parts, if only because it is faster and I could say that it reminds me of Bloodborne, but it is not very fast, but not slow. Added to this are various minor mechanics. But it's about the speed of bosses and opponents, which has changed drastically, the game has set the pace. That's why I recommend this game because it is amazing (even when you die). I'm not talking about the level of difficulty here, but about the mechanics, climate and history about which my head exploded. To sum up, if you are a fan of Dark Souls and you are thinking about buying, I personally recommend especially if you want to do it in 100% in achievements, and my friends play in cooperation mode, we are playing 100% because the team. But if you're in touch for the first time, start from the first part to this, because in my opinion, Dark Souls is not only a killing game, but also an amazing story, especially about how you get into it. That is why I would like to give her 10/10, because I do not see any flaws, I do not see them, even if I get angry, I keep coming back to her and speak positively about her.If you read this, thank you very much and I would like to say only one thing . !

Positive,"An incredible game to spend time on those summer nights that you feel life is meaningless.There will be times when you will swear to the developers of the game, or smash your chair so hard that it will never work properly again, or beg the mercy of the bosses while crying. You'll judge your life decisions while going through the same place for the 100th time at 2 am.But the desire to beat the developers and being able to say ""I beat Dark Souls 3"" will keep you going, and there will be an undefinable joy as you hit the final boss for the last time.Throughout your journey, you'll witness deep stories of NPCs. I'd give 9.9/10 for its great gameplay, graphics and story.-0.1 for the harm I dealt myself while playing it.",1

Graphics are beautifully awful, Storytelling is cool for anyone that likes a bit of mystery and connecting the pieces together.Only thing that I don't like about the game is that enemies can hit you through objects without getting staggered or anything.But again enemies occasionally can fall through the wall and die.

Positive,I got the game today and it is a lot of fun. I haven't played any game like it but I really enjoy it. If you rage easily after dying 100 times then it might not be the game for you.,1
Positive,"After over a year and a half of playing this game, I finally got gud",1
Positive,"Worth every penny. Most fast paced and active Dark Souls, you will definetly spend some quality time with it. The difficulty can be tough at first but the longer you play the easier it becomes. Just the lack of active poise makes the game artificially harder. Just don't install Reshade/Sweet FX or use any free cam mods because it causes you to get banned.",1
Positive,"Beat the game again on PC a couple of months ago, still can't forget the first message in the intro.""Yes, Indeed, it is called Lothric, where the transitory land of the lord of cinder converge""Haha, I could already recite the intro. LOL.If you are looking for intense fights, giant bosses, obscure story line, hardcore Action RPG game , then Dark Souls III is the game for you. You wake up from the grave, beat Gundyr after a couple of tries, then you travel the forest, the cave, the underworld, the city of snow, finally you collect souls and link the fire.The art is also pretty cool, mid-age style castle , nice-looking equipment and monsters with characteristics.Oh , of course there is the innovation: 1. The weapon skill, each weapon has it's skill set on L2/LT/ZL button2. The MP bar, spells are now limited by the MP but not counts.The only pity is that the steam version does not support cloud saves, which left a potential risk of losing your save.So much for the PC , guess I'll continue my adventure on PS4 even I already get the platinum trophy.I'll beat Newgame 8+ !Oh and how can you forget Hidetaka Miyazaki and his little game traps XD, love you as always! : )",1
Positive,"Dark Souls 3 - 9/10Damn nigga this shit is wanna not gonna be able that shit, niggas like index and tard ass Leona in el castle go so hard bruh they hit me so hard they dont even do that bruh these bosses hard as fuq and that omg this shit gets intense and when you do the boss like a bagioloin times nothing happening till you find the way to beat the boss. Fun to play with frinds go to bathroom grab some soap and run that mother fucking fuck mother fucker cock on the ground so taht you can play wioth the friends that you love so that you can play woth they as friends. Nothing is better tan that friendship and darksouls will bring you toghether wioth your friends. I love the PVPVEPVE when with the swords they shoot at enemy woth the thim eis roght never giv up hope they might kill you but that does bot mean that your a bad p[layer it just means that you need to improve on a few things sp taht you can realise hwp mayn to do whwen you remeber to do the parry of attack woth your ampount of rahmming.",1

Positive,It's a nice casual game to help you unwind.,1
Positive,ah i love dark souls it pretty funny,1
Positive,This game will twist your balls and slam them with a hammer.,1
Positive,"The majority of bosses in this game are really creative and fun to fight. Areas aren't as interconnected as other souls games but its still really solid. Combat system is smooth, and pvp is fun, just don't be embered in Crucifixtion woods. Bosses aren't super hard but they pose a fun challenge. To be honest, some of the mini-bosses are harder than the actual bosses. Everything may seem difficult, but its fair for the most part. Game glitches sometimes but isn't too bad. I guess what I'm trying to say is if you want a game to introduce you to the Souls series then this is it. I'd rate it a 9/10, try it out.",1
Positive,"Honestly, one of the best titles I've ever experienced, it's not entirely that good as a game.But it sure does make up for it in it's story and Boss soundtracks.If you look at it as a PVE game it does its job quite nicely aside from some minor flaw and issues here and there such as getting stun locked to death, or just getting 1-2-3 shot by an enemy or boss here or there. and the PVP is kinda bad but it's entirely avoidable.As for the story and level design it's honestly one of the best I've played, The story is kinda held back but oh boy, it's there and it makes me want to play the first two games, the level design is quite nice and will allow for the player to book it and run past at least a quarter of the stuff in the game if they want.The soundtrack is a nice bonus, it's not always there but the boss tracks are really nice, especially the ones for some of the later bosses in the game.In the end its up to you if it's worth baseline $60 or not. Probably not worth the $85 for the deluxe edition but if the game is on sale. It's totally worth the buy if you're into it.",1

Positive,"i would only rekomend this game for the real hardcore gamers. But i would rate it a 11/10 best lore, best bosses, nice weapons, you fell wery free to do what ever you want but still folowing a course whith smal pices of lore that forms a long story. ps/ wait untill sumer sale ;)and if you did :",1
Positive,Not for the casual gamer that is for sure. Amazing game with lots of history behind it. Hard to find but there are always lore videos and NPCs to talk to. Hard game but fun as hell to play! Praise the Sun and don't forget to dodge!,1
Positive,This in my opinion is a great entry point to the Dark Souls series from a gameplay perspective. It is very precise and well polished with a perfect level of difficulty for those looking for a challenge. The game also lacks some of the more trap-like 'bulls*** moments that 1 and 2 have. Invasions can be a pain for those who do not like them but they can be avoided as it requires use of an item to make you open to be invaded although you do get this item activated automatically after you kill a boss but it will go when you die. This item does however enable you to play co-op so bare in mind if you want to play co-op you will be open to invasions.,1
Positive,"This game is very fun and i've spent hours upon hours on it. This game to me can never get old since there are so many secrets and things to do in the game. I really do recommend this game to people if they like RPG's or games that you progress and level and all that,.",1
Positive,"Dark Souls 3 is probably my favorite Souls game in the francise.>It has controls that feel really smooth compared to the first and second game.>It has an awesome lore that you just want to know about.>Most bosses in the bosses have a fair challenge but can feel hard at the start.Lastly, the music and atmosphere. The atmosphere just feels great, it truly feels like a Dark Fantasy game that I always wanted. Some OSTs in this game are beautiful to listen to and never get bored when you hear them all the time.With that said, I think Dark Souls 3 is just incredible and if you're a newcomer in the series, then the third and last installment of the Dark Souls series is perfect.",1

Positive,Dark Souls 3 III is a super game it was so fun playing. i've never really played a RPG before so it was pretty new for but that just made it even more fun. i think it's great that you have to learn the patterns of the bosses and that made beating them even more satisfying. I was very intrigued by the story but still don't really get it. in a way that just makes it more intriguing.,1
Positive,"To start off id like to say this was my first souls game. I had started Bloodborne before, but never really got far. Now, to the review.I can safely say this is my favorite game ive ever played. The combat is so satisfying and rewarding. The bosses are so much fun, they have very good attacks, and i want to say right now that If you say the game is bullshit ever thats a complete and utter lie. Theres always something you could have done to save yourself (aside from bugs, those are problems) But the DLC, the Goddamnm DLC ANHDFNBSAHFHASf. Veyr good 10/10",1

Positive,"I really can't say right now what they could have done better.It has everything a Dark Souls needs:- an interesting world - the obscure story- many, many armours and weapons- the choice to play it your own way- fascinating enemies and bossesand so much more.A great ending for the Souls series.9,5/10Edit: You can play it without it's predecessors, still i would recommend to have played at least the first game of the series.It just makes the game experience even better.",1
Positive,One of the best games i ve ever played,1
Positive,"Having 391 hours on the game (currently) has given me a good idea of what makes me keep playing. Bosses- most of the time they're imaginative, dynamic and intimidating! After beating the game more than 3 times I can still be caught out by a random attack that sends the whole battle spiralling down hill, or learn that a boss actually has an attack I've never seen before ! (THE SOUL OF CIDER CAN PARRY :) Which may be down to me just being a bad player, but it still keeps the battle amusing and entertaining despite the fact that I die.General gameplay - if you have a decent graphics card or maybe even a crap one, you're pretty much set, the only issue will be at the beginning of the ringed city DLC where frame rate is as slow as watching rain drizzle down a window :/ However does get better eventually :) Multiplayer- This is the main reason I still play this game ! Every invasion is different, hilarious or exciting ! The community holding the game up is massive and still around 5 years after release. Whether you're teaming up with friends to kill a boss or doing 1v1's outside pontiffs, it's always fun and usually turns into a slaughterhouse !",1
Positive,"Dark Souls III was my first ever attempt at delving into a souls-like game. I have never been acquainted with such a title before, and i have to say this game is one of the best i've played in years; the gameplay, lore and atmosphere is done with so much care that it is just far too much to take in for a first playthrough.I had so much fun playing this game that the only apparent flaw i found was its explaining of controls to a player: you see, when i'm using a keyboard and mouse to play, i expect all the control prompts to be in keyboard and mouse. For no apparent reason, From Software decides that the PC port of this game should be in hand held controller language; consequently a first time player on keyboard and mouse would have spent a considerable amount of time learning the controls.Other than that, i highly recommend picking up this game for those with an immense amount of patience. Though i'm not sure how the other Dark Souls games hold up as i've never played the other two as of writing this review.",1

All in all, I highly recommend this game, and the entire Souls(borne) series!",1

Positive,Worth the money. 0 deaths,1
Positive,"This game is amazing, everything about it captures my attention.but none of that means anything after you lose all of your souls, it sucks man.:(",1
Positive,"One of those games where you love and hate it, By love I mean play it over and over again because the gameplay is so well designed, and the feeling of finally beating that one boss is so satisfying you can t stop. And the hate it s from you losing to that boss that seems to never die! All and all the game is a solid masterpiece argueably this is the best one ever created, I ll support fromsoftware in any project they do. Because this game was amazing.",1
Positive,"""You will die. A lot."" Or so a lot of people will say after playing this game. Definitely one of the best games of our lifetime that incorporates the trial and error games of classic games. Gameplay is the same as any souls-like game: you acquire souls that can be used for experience and currency; You die, and you drop every non-spent souls to the location of your death. You fail to reacquire those souls, those souls are forfeit; So those 100k souls you got from a boss and you lost them? Oops, they're gone forever. The good news is, you'll respawn after your death to the nearest bonfire you lit. That's the beauty of this game, you get to fix the mistakes that led you to your death.If you've played the previous souls games, you will know how convoluted the lore is. You would have to read every item description and pick up the lore yourself, piece by piece. Dark Souls 1 was the best when it comes to lore-building with characters that are so empathetic and it set the stage for a world full of sadness that is present throughout the series. Or so I thought. Darksouls 2 was ""meh"" in this regard. The lore strayed from anything relating to the first game and it made less of a sequel (for me) and more of a spin-off souls game. Dark Souls 3, however, gave the series the much needed finale everyone is clamoring for: Seeing previous places from the 1st game and previous NPCs you helped (or killed) along the way. If you're worried about the story, don't; Dark Souls 3 is a proper sequel to the first game and you wouldn't be disappointed with the world building and aesthetics the director went for.If you're tired of modern games' too easy approach with action RPGs, play the Dark Souls series. If you played the previous games and you're on the fence on buying the ""last"" Souls game, I can say with certainty that Dark Souls 3 is the proper send-off you're looking for. So go ahead and ""take the plunge, you won't die."" While you're at it, remember that Praising the Sun is vital to your success.",1

I can even call it my favorite of all time. +The graphics aren't anything special but combined with the lighting makes up for some stunning visuals .- The game isn't for everybody as it is known the game can be challenging at times and the gameplay might get frustrating .- Though playable on both a controller and a keyboard, for people who want I guess less of a challenge might want to invest in a controller (even though I myself am playing with a keyboard).So in conclusion if you love depressing stories and a bit of a challenge this game is for you.",1

Positive,Nice soundtrack :) recommend this game for a satisfying kill :D,1
Positive,"I've beaten this game 3 times at this point and have only played it for 66 hours. Everytime I play it I am amazed by the levels Fromsoft have put together. Every boss, character, enemy, and location is so unique I always look forward to seeing something new. The combat is spot on, Every time I die I know it was my fault, There was no game mechanic that I couldn't get past or some bug, I simply was not skilled enough. I would train, level up, and go back an try again I would win. Additionally finally beating a boss that you have been stuck on is the most satisfying feeling. The only gripe I have with DS3 is the RNG can get the best of you sometimes. All in all this game truely is amazing, I would definitely would put this game in my top 3 favorite games. However do not play this game if you easily get angry or don't like challenges.",1
Positive,"Though I have not yet experienced the entirety of the game, so far I d say it has a fantastic pro-to-con ratio. (Will update once I have finished the game.) Pros: I like that there is a constant objective to reach, (bonfires) so it does not feel like you re only playing from start to end. This game is really enjoyable to play with friends and a great bonding experience since it takes good communication and sequence to defeat certain bosses. The graphics is very good and the lore is well-written, I myself enjoy reading each person/creature I come upon s background stories and information.Characters are completely customizable and you can make your character look like you if you put in the effort and time. Everything on your face/body can be altered to look like a replica of you. The monsters are creepy looking like you would expect from a horror-genre game. However these monsters are capable of triggering anxiety for most common fears. (Which adds to the charm of the game for me at least.) The difficulty is quite hard but I find it endearing and makes me want to play this game from morning to night. The hard early-on bosses prepares you for the later battles, and is almost similar to Monster Hunter when it comes to combat style. If you die you do not immediately lose the souls you collect (The in-game currency) The game lets you retrieve it unless you die before you reach the location it dropped. [There s honestly so many pros but I can t name them off the top of my head, I ll just name them later when I update this.]CONS:The FPS drops can get irritating and prevents me from playing with other online people. (This can be fixed, I just haven t attempted.)It feels like I spend most my time on this game looking at the loading screen because it takes forever to load. The first boss made me have a couple mental breakdowns and I think the game can lower his difficulty just a little bit for first DS players like me. (Took me 13 hours to defeat him.) The places are really hard to navigate even with the blood stain lore paths. (I don t read them, there s too many.) Though this could honestly just be a me problem. This game slowly eats your time, but it s always a choice",1

Positive,"This is the first Dark Souls that I play, I always had this mental image on what this game would be, but I was not expecting that it delivered much more of ""YOU DIED"" as I expected.This game is visceral, unforgiving, full of mystery and gritty. If you are expecting a friendly, but boring tutorial that will pleasantly guide you through the UI and the game mechanics while showing several colorful popups on your screen, well, you won't find it. There is a minimal if not lacking explanation of everything. If you enjoyed the times where you were playing Isaac and you had no idea of each item does, this is for you. I wasn't able to progress much more than 30 minutes early in the game without having to read walk-throughs. I hadn't rage quitted a game since my most unsuccessful games of League of Legends, this game was to be special. Weird items, strange locations, confusing map (is there even one?), hard encounters, ambushes, overpowered enemies, unfair abilities, losing stuff when dying. the list goes on! It has been a while since I had a fear of engaging an enemy, that dodging to attack felt like it mattered or even the feeling to find a checkpoint, the perception of progress was one of a kind. And yes, I am fully aware that I am terrible at this game.If you are looking for a hardcore RPG experience, this might be the game for you. I am not sure if I will be ever able to beat this game as my hatred towards it builds up as each death, but who knows in some time.",1

Positive,"Dark Souls III is an amazing game full of challenge and hardship. I have only completed two endings so far, and I put a whole two years in between the playthroughs, but that doesn't detract from how much of a blast I was having the whole time. I played my first playthrough almost 100% blind. I played my second playthrough following tons of guides online, learning how Scalings worked, and being efficient with my levels (not just pouring them into Vitality and Strength). There are so many subtle details in everything: gameplay, story, and visuals. The sound design is great too (Music is good, SFX are good), but I wouldn't pinpoint it as one of the main things that held me to it. Of course, good sounds design isn't exactly 'supposed' to be noticed, because then it wouldn't be ""subtle."" Anyways, this is becoming more of a rant/rave than a review. I'll end it here.Honest to GabeN, one of the best games I've ever played in my entire life. 10/10(P.S.

Rpg builds have an amazing sweet of diversity including fast swing small sword and slow swing bigsword with magic dipping sause. Specking into magic or archery is about as useful as dodge rolling into them for damage. Game is significant downgrade from Dark Souls 1 with sh11ty map design and lack of large goddess t1tt1es.

Positive,"tl:dr Just an amazing and beautiful game that i cant let go off.Now for real, there's so much that makes this game good that i have to apologise if it gets messy trying to show all of it. The first thing i have to say is about the difficulty. While the meme ""The Dark Souls of."" can be both annoying and hilarious, the difficulty isnt That Bad, the game is challenging but fair for example when a group of enemies seems unbeatble you still have many options, from running through them, learning their moves, gainning an advantage point or even farming previous enemies to become stronger. The trick to dark souls is having lots of patience, some rythm and never quitting on the idea that you have to ""Git Gud"" because you will reach that stage by simply playing without qitting.Another hallmark of dark souls is the music, which is mindblastingly EPIC, it surrounds you and while you might not realise it's there, if you go listen to it without the hectic bossfight you'll somehow know exactly how it sounds and from which boss its connected to. I know big orchestral works aren't everyone's cup of tea, but for those like me, you'll love it!The gameplay is mildly smooth, by which i mean, itll respond quickly and most of the times it's one of the best parts of the game, but this only works when you get used to the attack animations. They're your biggest weakness, as you can't stop middway, you cant correct where you'll attack and you cant stop your enemies from punishing you for misjudging an attack and you wont get used to gameplay unless you get confortable with it.The game has multiple levels of new game+ and a lot of online things to do that'll keep you busy for too long, in fact my problem is keeping the game down and playing something else, because once you start loving it nothing else can give you the same feeling and it has enough content to keep you playing.I love the game, the experience it gives is one of a kind, and while it's worth the price and more, its understandable if you're going to wait for dicounts.",1
Positive,Dark Souls 3 is the Dark Souls of Dark Souls.,1
Positive,"Very good game! Great graphics, some hidden but deep and interesting lore, epic story, dramatic and very cool music and a lot more to explore in Dark Souls 3.

Positive,This game is like dark souls,1
Positive,"This game? The best game from Souls series. Dark Souls 3 is the better brother of Dark Souls 1. While DS1 was a gem, DS3 is a Jewel clear as a day. The graphics are splendid, and they feel truly smooth. Had a hard time getting used to DS1's clunky graphics after investing 150 hours into the third part. The gameplay feels naturally difficult and fair. Die, analyze, die, try everything, and eventually succeed. While being known for its difficulty level, its not unfair. There are plenty of weapons to choose from, so I'm sure everyone will find something made just for them.Your patience will be put on line many times, so i definitely can't recommend it for anyone with short temper. Definitely recommended.P.S Don't fight Friede. Your sanity is worth more.",1
Positive,"I've heard a lot about the ""Souls"" games over the years, never really thought I'd play one of them though. Yet here I am, partially because a friend bought it for me and almost made me feel bad for not playing it.IDK what else to say about it other than: it wasn't as hard as I thought it would be. Hard, sure, but not insane-level hard. Of course that doesn't mean I didn't enjoy feeling like a god for finally killing that stupid Soul of Cinders after 10+ deaths.The DLCs (especially The Ringed City) makes this game even better.Base game: Deluxe edition:",1

Positive,"Got this off the monthly Humble Bundle for $12 a few weeks ago and just finished the main game.Pros:- Good variety of weapons, spells and armor. Weapons and some shields have weapon arts or parry animations which add more variety to combat.- Good variety of enemies. Each new level you get to you'll see new enemy models who will have different attacking patterns which helps keep the game fresh. Most levels will also have a mini-boss which can be even more challenging than some main bosses.- Good map design which encourages exploration.- Good boss fights. This is the part of the game where you're probably going to spend most of your time and you can see the devs put a lot of effort into those. The scenery when you enter some of the boss areas is simply amazing like when you are in the cathedral and about to fight Point Sulyvahn and he's slowly walking towards you and his sword goes in flames- Great soundtrack. Not much to add here honestly.- Lore is fairly decent if you're willing to read through item descriptions (plenty of youtube videos covering this if you can't be bothered to read). There's not much story going on though aside from item descriptions and a few dialogues.- Replayability is there in the form of NG+ where you basically start off from scratch with the same character. There's also pvp stuff like duels or invasions if you can ignore the delayed hit reg.- Plenty of secrets if you're into collecting every item there is in the game.- Co-op is there which is a nice featureCons:- Bad camera controls. Camera focus randomly breaking or your camera randomly shaking are just a few things that you will have to deal with on a regular basis. - Game mechanics are poorly explained. Tutorial only goes over combat and still manages to leave out important things like weapon arts, staggering or poise. Weapon ugrades, transposing boss souls and weapon scaling are other examples of game mechanics that are poorly explained. - Not a stellar port. Constant fps drops in some areas like Irithyll dungeon or Archdragon peak. - Noticeable texture popping - Lots of bugs ranging from harmless ones like getting stuck in fog to game breaking ones like bosses glitching into walls or staggered bosses parrying attacks and one-shotting youConclusion: this was a good game for me and I would recommend it if you can put up with some of the technical problems the game is suffering from",1

(combined music/graphics/design)+ I expected far worse controls? I liked the not so obvious ""quest"" system but I felt like I could use a small journal ?

Positive,"I always thought Dark Souls 3 was good, but not great. 7.5/10 or so. I had played through 99% of the game, DLC included, so even at good I definitely kept coming back. And then, in what would become the most memorable gaming experience of my life, something clicked.Potentially game ruining spoilers ahead!It started off slowly. First, I finally understood the appreciation and admiration the hitboxes get. I grew to appreciate them too, and in game, I grew to appreciate close calls. And I thought about the work that went into the technical part of building the hit boxes, and tried to imagine that math that went into them. It was beyond me, but I imagined that it was complex, but had to be solvable. After all, the hitboxes were extremely well done. So I was impressed about the technological aspect of the game. These hitboxes had to have been just right for this game to work.But, wait. Solvable. Just right. And then I asked myself: What if Dark Souls is solvable? CLICK! Dark Souls isn't an action game, it's a puzzle game.And once I adopted that mindset - action and counter action, step, counter-step the end boss that ignites the Dark Souls 3 community to the point of division became solvable.You effectively ""undo"" the actions of your opponents the game. It gets to the point that it's basically rhythmic.The boss I had struggled with across multi-hour long sessions went from maddeningly hard to frustrating to confusing to manageable.And from manageable to predictable. And predictable to easy.I will note that even though I had an understanding of the boss, it still took many more tries, as my occasional missteps did add up, and the punishments and odd reward did correct me. Once I even watched myself perform the incorrect action with both myself and the boss at last life, one hit to go. I attacked when I should have rolled. ""Damn, that's going to cost the match,"" I thought, and it did. I went back, and eventually I had the bosses pattern down so well that the narrative I told myself as I played had gone from frustrated to friendly! I started talking to him like a misbehaving puppy. I grew to appreciate him, losing again and again. In another match, I finally noticed that this boss is blind, and ""holy shit, they programmed that into the game!"" His attacks are brutal and relentless not out of ferocity but out of desperation. He must shut down whatever threat may be present as quick as possible, as everything that fights him has the advantage of sight! His ""tantrums,"" as I hand started calling them, became pitiable. He was scared. My narrative shifted from annoyed to soothing. I empathized with the boss! I felt sorry for him! Dark Souls 3 made me bond with perhaps the hardest boss in the game. Eventually, the time came when I realised that I clearly had the upper hand. I was going to win. Victory was nearly assured, and what did I feel? Sadness. I felt sad. I felt sadness similar to the feeling one gets when you put down a beloved pet. The final stroke felt like a duty. A necessary evil. I stood in the empty cavern after, and wondered what now? For me, Midir had become the game. I empathized with a blind old dragon, and Dark Souls made me put it down like Old Yeller.What the fuck Dark Souls.10/10 would play again. Masterpiece.",1
Positive,"Definately one of the greater games I have played. I have 71 hours and I haven't completed the game yet, This is because the game is so unique with classes and different play styles that I end up making new characters just to have some fun.Areas never seemed repetitive for me, I was always excited to move on and encounter enemies which were challenging yet fun to battle. You can also really tell the difference between areas as they were so well made.Yes this game can be a little frustrating at times, for example some of the side quests you are bound to fail because you barely are given any clue as to what to do. Then again that's what the game is about: difficulty.I would 100% recommend this game to people looking for a challenge and who want to replay the game over and over again.",1
Positive,"A challenging game set in a gritty and dark fantasy world. The game alone is a tough and unforgiving one that will punish players for mistakes until success is achieved. This, when paired with the PVP aspect makes the game a very difficult one to pick up casually. However, it is by far one of my favorite games. The determination it takes to get through the game without help allows you to grow as a gamer and be able to take on any challenge the game throws at you. Not to mention that the lore in this game and all of the rest of the franchise is among the richest and well thought of in any game I have ever played. Overall, it is a great game to play by yourself or with friends. Just don't expect it to be easy, and you'll eventually get the hang of it. If you can beat Dark Souls, there aren't many games you can't conquer.",1
Positive,"First DS title I'm playing. If you think this game looks way too overwhelming, then you thought the same as me. Buy I can tell you now, I was wrong (you still might be right btw).This isn't just a pray you don't get killed game, you make peace with dying quick. Or should at least. There is so much lore in this game that I'm going to play through again once I've finished it (not even close yet) to play with a full guide. Strategy, dodging, not using the estus button to fight is key in defeating any enemy you encounter. Diablo is for noobs. Try it out. It's so cheap. On humble bundle. I do however recommend a controller. Keyboard is playable but the keys are all weirdly placed.",1
Positive,"HOW IT PLAYSCompared to latest entries, the control of the character is now very close to perfect, fluid and you feel 100% in control of it. Said this the ""casualification"" of the gameplay is obvious. The combat is less punishing and it's too easy for the player to avoid damage, which I guess it's okay because damage absorption is fucked, it never really makes a difference how much armor you have. The online works good enough. As a host the more phantoms you have the more likely you are to get invaded, so from the invader's perspective you're going to be fighting in a 2v1 situation in average. It may seem a huge advantage but it's not really, people who summon that amount of phantoms is because they are not good at the game so in the end it's nicely balanced, although I think there should be a system to punish endless resummoning of phantoms. It's still p2p so this alone is going to produce salt on both ends.HOW IT FEELSThe game is good. Not great. The dlcs have pretty memorable bosses but for the most part the game feels uninspired. Contrary to the first entry of the series the game gets better in its second half, lothric castle is a really solid area and from there to the ending is really good, as well as the DLCs which are also quite good. BUT -there's always a but- it has lost the magic of dark souls, the atmosphere, the fever-dream-like sensation of being immersed in the story is gone.A really solid game that perfectioned technicalities and mechanics of previous entries but has lost the ""Berserk"" feel that made Dark Souls so good. A good game nonetheless and the ost is quite good on this one.The best entry point in the saga for newbies.",1

Positive,"Would I recommend this game.Absolutely, I love the game but what I see in the reviews is people feel as though they don't know what they are talking about in their reviews, this game is easy and here is where the root of all my issues stem from. Just gonna clarify again, I absolutely loved this game and it's still my go to game. However you people who say this game is ""insanely hard"" and the ""hardest game"" you've ever played is total bullshit. This game has it's core mechanics that you are expected to learn with Ludex Gundyr, and master before the Lord of Cinder or nameless king. However the biggest issue with the game is it's exploitability with enemies and terrain that allow you to get easy kills which inherently makes the game a shit ton more easy to beat. There is too many bonfires too! Like what the hell? This is a darksouls game, this isn't supposed to reward the player for holding down the run button across a bridge to Irithyll. Abyss watcher freeze glitch Irithyll dungeon wall skip, allows you to quickly get from the entrance of the dungeon to the Profaned Capital. Giant worm guarding the Old demon boss, can be killed by the ballista. Giant demon can be killed by mimic in the Catacombs of Carthus Yhorm can be 4 hit with a sword? Irithyll Wall hop skip",1

Positive,"After being very interested in the challenges games like Dark Souls represent I have tried, and failed (many times) to get INTO a Dark Souls game. I tried Dark Souls, Dark Souls II and many other games that use a similar concept such as the direct clone but (whilst at times beautiful) very flawed Lord of the Fallen.and they just never clicked with me. Something about them just seemed off in some way.Dark Souls 3 is a different beast in my opinion, I have completely and utterly fallen in love with this game. Visually its stunningly (grotesquely) gorgeous. The art style is captivating. Ive spent quite a bit of the game just bathing in the horrific/gothic architecture. Lighting effects are used to incredible effect on environments and characters or beasties. The first time I encountered a rather large creature (no spoilers) hugging the walls of a huge structure I was in complete awe. Visually its probably one of the best looking games, maybe even the most beautiful game I have ever played. And the creature design is simply awesome. A lot of love and attention has been put into creating every single one of them. Big and small.and HUGE!Gameplay wise - well, its a Dark Souls game so it dishes out punishment in heaps and then some. I have had my ass handed to me so many times and I still keep going back for more. What is great though, is it never feels truely unfair. In most occassions, if you die, its because you probably cocked up in some way, or you just arent ready for that fight yet. The combat is tight and responsive and absoloutely relentless in its punishment for mistakes. Learning how an enemy moves, what its strengths and weaknesses are and playing the patient game, waiting for that opening that will help you get the edge when you are up against a boss is probably one of the most rewarding experiences in a video game - providing it pays off of course.Level design is outstanding, from craggy clifftops to dungeons and castle keeps and ramparts. It can be a maze of secrets, terrors and beauty and it never gets old or feels samey. There are so many secrets to discover in this game and so much to explore. I find myself traversing back through areas 5 or 6 times and still finding something different or something I missed before.Sound design is also top notch and definately helps to immerse you. Whispers or wails can be generally creepy whilst the sounds of enemies and especially bosses just get better for each encounter.I seriously cant recommend this game enough, even those that have tried previous Dark Souls titles and failed to get into them. Give Dark Souls 3 a shot. It is definately the most polished of the 3 and is just an incredible rewarding and yes at times infuriating experience. But its an experience that shouldn't be missed.GRAPHICS - Holy *hit biscuts!GAMEPLAY - Hold my beer!LEVEL DESIGN - I'm lost, a little scared and if I'm honest, probably a little excited too.SOUND - Probably one of the most terrifying aspects of the game.OVERALL - It will tear your soul apart!",1

The environments are stunning to look at as well, no doubt.But.This game doesn't capture what made DS1 great, and honestly, I don't think anything will from here on (Bloodborne almost did it.). It's clearly a fan service game, and that's fine I suppose, but it could have been something much more.I don't mean to sound so negative about the title; as I said, it's a good game, probably the best out of the three to get newcomers into the series. However, it definitely falls short of what it could have been.All in all, I freakin' love these games so I'll end up being bias no matter what I say. Try it out if it looks like something you're into.R.I.P. DS",1

Positive,"this is a good game but the references are way too frequent there's a difference between fan service and just shoving references in your face every 10 mins too much. anyway you will definitely have fun with this it is not the best souls game but as a souls-like game, it's pretty decent. if you aren't comparing it to one of the older souls titles I would have to give this game an 8/10 for a souls like experience that will still fill you some of that mystery and awe that the first game had have fun with this game and don't gank because I will find you if you gank. (don't correct me on my spelling)",1
Positive,"Let me start off by apologizing for likely errors in my spelling, as english is not my first language.I'd like to say that DS3 is probably the most approachable of all the souls games, as it's a bit more streamlined and easier than the previous ones in my opinion. The story is a little clearer but not entirely revealed, some blanks are filled in with item descriptions or by your own imagination if you're not into reading that much.The game offers a lot, and I mean a lot of gear options and even more if we go into spells and ""hidden gear"". That said, it's entirely possible to complete the game with the starting gear if you so choose or just find something you like and go with it, it doesn't really matter what you use if it gets the job done.The online experience is one of the many reasons I love this game, even after hundreds of hours of play (My total time with this game is not reflected here as I also own it on ps4). You could be making steady progress and doing ok even until suddenly ""thisdudeyoudontknow has invaded"" runs up to you from nowhere, maybe even gets a hand from another invader, or attacks you in a bad spot and puts you in your place without so much as a wave. It's part of the Dark Souls experience, an essential part even. That also makes it all the more enjoyable when invaders show you the courtesy of letting you clear out the mobs around you first, even heal yourself and make it a duel. All in all this is a great single player game, a great multiplayer game and certainly a challenge for new players.Solid 9/10 in my book.",1

I swore I would never play another Darksouls game again because to me Dark souls 2 was utter garbage. With that said I decided to give Dark souls 3 a chance to drag me into this franchise that many people seem to think is good. I must say I believe I'm starting to understand why people enjoy the Dark Souls series. The game can be challenging I wont say hard because if you use your head in combat and focus on building your character the way you like it than it's not hard. What I have come to love about Dark Souls 3 is the focus on character progression, This game is centered around it and if you don't focus on your character progression you will be punished in certain places in the game. With all this said I believe that this game is beautiful and well built the controls could use a bit more work however they dont make the game unplayable.",1

This may not be a game for everyone, but if it is a game for you it is amazing. Singleplayer is great and Multiplayer is seamless. There several different ways to build your character and the weapons are balanced so that every one of my friends has a different go-to weapon that they always use when the going gets rough. You don't see everyone using the ""Best weapon in the game"" at endgame because there simply isn't any ""best weapon in the game"" its all about what looks and feels good.

Positive,"This is absolutely a great game, and arguably the most well-rounded souls game. However, this is the souls game I've put the least amount of playtime into, even less so than DS2.If I had to say the reason for this, I think it's the atmosphere, and the fact that the souls series hasn't really pushed boundaries or innovated in a way that evolves the genre or the games themselves much at all.Don't worry though, the combat is rock solid and feels the best it has in any souls game in my opinion.Simply put, DS3 is a refinement of all the mechanics present in previous souls games. The themes have stagnated a bit since it's conception as a franchise though, and this game doesn't really add anything significant to its repertoire.Again, it's a great game with great combat and awesome boss fights, but I came out feeling slightly unsatisfied with it.While I partially blame the pre-release hype (which I feel happens a lot these days) there were way too many callbacks and references for no other reason than to just appeal to fans (and dare I say to just add more content without having to design more from scratch). This level of self-awareness and the endlessly repeated themes just gets sort of tiresome and can take you out of an otherwise excellent experience.Also - weapon arts:While certainly cool, they often are the only thing that will differentiate a weapon from another within the same class. And even then, one weapon art will often be shared across multiple other weapons, sometimes that are in different classes. It's frustratingly counter intuitive because weapon arts should help each weapon feel unique, but what ends up happening is more or less the opposite.I obviously still recommend that you play this game, especially if you're a fan of the series. It really is great, I'm just showing some tough love as a fan myself. Just don't expect it to be the sendoff you were hoping the series would receive.",1
Positive,Fun and a great family friendly experience,1
Positive,Amazing atmosphere with very satisfying gameplay. People often cite the game as too difficult but as long as you're willing to learn it isn't too bad.,1
Positive,Dark Souls is like the Evangelion of anime,1
Positive,"This is the first Dark Souls game I played, and I absolutely love it. I play with a Steam controller and it works very well.Needless to say, the game is very challenging and you're expected to die a lot, so be ready to learn from your mistakes often. There is hardly any guidance in the game, as the tutorial simply tells you the game's controls and then it throws you into the thick of it. Expect a steep learning curve that will test you before you even finish the tutorial.There is co-op, but it exists atomically with random PvP encounters. So, you can get help from other players (random ones or specific ones that share your password), but not without making yourself vulnerable to invasion by enemy players. While sometimes annoying, it's hard to deny that this fits with the hardcore tone of the game.The one thing I will complain about is about is the camera. The FoV is pretty narrow and you can't change it, so you don't always get to take in all of your surroundings. This sucks because the game has gorgeous levels.Use the wiki to your advantage since hardly anything about the game's mechanics is explained in-game. Don't let frustration ruin the game for you, and you'll git gud in no time.",1
Positive,"Are you a fan of games crafted with mindblowing lore, over the top quality world and level design?This game is for you.Are you a fan of balanced gameplay that demands you to GIT GUD?This game is for you.Are you a fan of multiplayer PVP or COOP action?This game is for you.Do you like to punish others?This game is for you.Do you like to explore the world, know and feel the story of the world on your own rather than being spoonfed by cutscenes and stuff?This game is for you.Do you like to have fun?Go ahead and play the souls series.In a nutshell, this game/series is rich with quality lore, world design, a gameplay mechanic that rewards for yor courage, exploration, risks, and makes you better each time you play the level. And with an online multiplayer integrated semmlessly throught the game.",1
Positive,10/10Would want Anal examination again.,1
Positive,"Played it so many times, got all the achievements, and the replay values are endless. Buy this game.*Edit: do not buy this game it sucks",1
Positive,"Frankly, as a new comer to the souls series, I thought I'm looking at a stress test ""since i'm used to hack & slash type of games"" except i'm looking at a masterpiece that made me (Git Gud) over time. I honestly thought i won't spend 2 hours playing. And now i'm near over 65 hours and nearly starting my NG+ with ease. As much as any of the world-building and design, I enjoy the sense of being in a world made up of layers, revealing unexpected pathways & routes.highly recommended 10/10.",1
Positive,"""You Died"" never has a game given so much emphasis on trial and error. This game forces you to be very aware of your enemies and surroundings because you are never safe and never has a game allowed me to enjoy dying and retrying everytime. With 60 plus hours in already, and still not done with the base story I have found a new genre that i hope to love with every future Dark Souls game to come. I found this unknown jem in my gaming world because of a sale and boy am I sorry i did not buy this and previous installs earlier because i missed some great games. understanding the controls does take a minute especially with keyboard and mouse. But if you are a true pc gamer like me then this is very minor and can always be changed to fit my taste. no pc gamer should ever complain about controls unless you can not remap which you can in Dark Souls III. So be prepared to Die and love every minute of it.",1
Positive,This game has very friendly community wtih enjoyable stress free casual gameplay and amazing story. Recommended for children +6 of age.,1
Positive,SUPER good game would definetly suggest to anyone who wants a challenge!,1
Positive,All are good other then the DEX builds,1
Positive,"Very good, though not as good as ds1. There are many, many callbacks to ds1 and 2. I'm not one to mind that, but even if you are, I think you'd ignore it when playing such a good game.",1
Positive,EZ game,1
Positive,"My opinions on this game regularly change. Sometimes it is amazingly fun and sometimes I feel like putting my head through my monitor and my foot through my PC. I've beaten the game several times and put hundreds of hours into PvP and will review PvE and PvP individually.First PvE. While one of, in my opinion, it is one of the weaker PvE's in the series, it is still solid and probably one of the most reliable in terms of combat. There are a few issues I have with it, however. First of all, many enemies are extremely 'spammy' and fast. This isn't bad 90% of the time, but occasionally, despite being the most fast paced Dark Souls game, your character cannot deal with the situation. Some enemies feel like they are rejected Bloodborne enemies, a game which I do personally prefer. This is rarely unfair, however, and adds another layer of difficulty which is needed now that the combat is more refined and reliable. Dark Souls 3 is also surprisingly linear in comparison to previous entries. The best example of where this is not the case is the original Dark Souls, my personal favourite. Here, instead of branching paths and shortcuts between areas, you effectively move from one area to the next in a set order. There are occasions where multiple paths are offered for you, but the chances are one is 'correct' and mandatory and the other is optional and is a dead end. Despite these flaws, however, I must say that DS3 has a near unmatched boss quality, if not for Bloodborne. Some of the series' best are in this title and its DLC (my personal favourites being Sister Friede and Gael). The areas themselves are also quite fun to explore and have shortcuts within themselves. It is a shame they don't link separate areas like the series was once known for though.PvP is what I have spent the majority of my hours on. The sheer amount of possible builds and play styles in PvP is amazing but also its biggest flaw. With this many options, it is near impossible for it all to be balanced, which is the case here. Certain weapons and builds are immensely overpowered and in some cases broken. I would be lying if I said that it is impossible to counter these builds, for I myself have learnt how to deal with some of them (like a certain pair of UGS) but it can be immensely frustrating to come up against a player who kills you in a single stun lock combo or instantly parries and one shots you.The thing with Dark Souls is these flaws and this jank is what makes it so special. Yes, you can be one shot parried and ganged up on by four people, or R1 spammed by a straight sword, or get stuck in weapon arts from Ringed Knight UGS or Friede's Scythe, but it is the only game where you get the immense satisfaction of landing a parry yourself or successfully killing all four of those gankers spamming R1 and chugging. I can't lie, I have walked away from this game for extended periods due to frustration, but this addictive satisfaction has pulled me back time and time again. This is why I recommend this game, because despite its many flaws, it offers a feeling of satisfaction unmatched by other games of this generation. While this is most certainly not the best in the series (I would recommend DS1 or BB more), it is still a game that is well worth your time.",1
Positive,it might be fun it might drive you insane but be careful if you play it too much it might consume your soul 10/10.,1
Positive,Played a little bit and got ****ed so hard . but it was fun !,1
Positive,One of the best RPG I ever played.- Good lore- Nice combat system- Unique art style- Funny Invader and Phantom- Wide open world- Best rage quit I ever have :>,1
Positive,"Pro's:- lots of unique weapons and playstyles, any build is viable- good graphics, great atmosphere and a deep lore- endearing NPCs with their own questlines, completely optional- challenging and intimidating bosses, all unique to each other- depending on how well you do the playtime can range from 40-70 hours (without NG+)- Co-op with pals enhances the experience- high replay valueCon's:- Online mode occasionally glitches (e.g. invaders only the host can see, region-lock not doing its job and lags)- in terms of PvP the host is favored over the invader, especially when the host has 2 friendly phantoms + 1 blue sentinel/darkmoon on his side- Dancer of the Boreal Valley- overdone with references to the previous souls titles",1
Positive,"10/10 Would die again and again, and again, and again",1
Positive,tongue but hole,1
Positive,"This is my first review ever for a game well deserving of it. I like to keep it simple instead of writing a full story so I will just make a quick list with pros & cons:Pros- Great gameplay. Fast gameplay where good timing is the key. Good graphics. ULTIMATE GOOD MUSIC. Awesome locations. The world in this game is just so dark and scary yet so beautiful. Incredible bosses and enemies. Fun to replay a few times. I finished the game with 8 different characters now and got 1 character past newgame +5. Great DLC. DLC 1 wasn't really that big sadly but the second was well worth every penny. Aside from a few problems I will mentions at the con list, the multiplayer is fun. A thrilling hidden story. Cons- For me this isn't really a con but you must be patient. You'll probably die a lot in this game since it's pure trial and error. I've just seen many people hating games like this for it. Many abilities like lots of magic and also certain weapons that are weak or even useless. When you PVP in this game most guys that turn out to win are quality builds (characters who use STR and DEX) and use fast melee weapons. Also magic is just slow they need to buff it somehow. The summon system. Sure it's part of Dark souls and I get why, I also know this game is more meant to play solo then with friends and yet it's really annoying sometimes to play this with friends since it's kinda hard to stay together. I wish games like these had a more fun way to CO-OP. They should put more attention on the LUCK stat. In the beginning you get to pick a class, I would recommend picking either pyromancer or knight since they have the lowest luck stat which is a GOOD thing, luck is really useless unless you run a few certain things. WHY DO I RECOMMEND THIS GAME?-Aside from a bit BS this game brings, it's awesome, dark souls as a series really opend my heart from time to time. The hidden story in Dark souls is just amazing and the world and music just makes it so nice. I love it. I would rate it a 8/10. :)(sorry for bad english)",1
Positive,if u want to break ur gaming gear please buy this game,1

Positive,"Possibly one of the best RPGs and the best souls game I've ever played.It has a great and interactive storyline. The landscapes are decayed, yet beautiful. The combat is fun and interesting. Most boss designs are difficult, but amazing.It's a difficult game, especially if you're new to the series, but it's 100% worth it.",1
Positive,"Hello I'm just going to inform anyone reading this review that it will probably be pretty long. but I will also include a short synopsys at the bottom of the review.I will be rateing dark souls 3 based on combat, enemies, and lore (there will also be a pros and cons list). I'll also include tips for new players who want to get the game because it can be kind of confusing. Oh and I will include a list of who would and wouldn't like dark souls 3.Combat:The combat in this game is amazing. It is very stratigic and is based around attacking at the right time and dodging at the right time. For the most part you have four things to worry about in combat: health, dodging, attacking, and blocking (if you have a shield). Combat is very quick and relies on fast reflexes as well as memorizing patterns that the enemies and bosses attack with. The combat flows pretty well but the hit boxes are extremely bad when it comes to pvp (player versus player). Pve (player versus entity) is pretty balanced as long as you keep dodging and attacking at the right time.\Enemies: Dark Souls 3 has many different enemies that fight in many different ways. For the most part enemies in this game (that are close to your level) kill you in 2-3 hits which also depends on your heath pool. But if you can dodge well you can save yourself from taking damage. Almost all enemies have different move sets and combinations that they use. You can fight an enemy once and defeat it but next time their combination of moves will change and you will die. Bosses have more move sets than any of the normal mobs and they are faster and hit harder. Most bosses kill you in 1-3 hits depending on your health pool. Bosses will also take multiple tries to defeat because you need to memorize their move sets to know how and when to dodge. Lore:If your not interested in lore you can just skip this section but if you want to know keep reading. The lore in dark souls 3 is well hidden within the environment as well as the items you find in the game. Most of the lore is this game brings in things from the past two games as well as some new developments. If you want a game that is all fighting and pretty much no story you would probably like this game. While dark souls 3 has a lot of lore and a good story you can just ignore it totaly if you want. But at the same time if you like story and lore in a game you would also like this. Be warned though some of the lore is kind of disgusting (what happened to a lot of the characters I mean). For instance you can look up Aldritch the devourer of Gods lore and see just how disgusting it is. But for the most part the story is very very good.Pros:Great combatGreat storycool armorweapons with cool weapon artspvp and pvegiant bosses!multiple classesvery difficultCons:bad pvp hitboxesarmor doesn't help much at all besides looking coolStory is not present it must be found while playingBosses that you will have to fight over and over (10-20 times +)can get invaded by other players while embered (this is just apart of the game and you have to accept it)magic is useful for pve not so much for pvpvery difficultPeople who would like dark souls 3:People who like rich lorepeople who like challenging combatpeople who like a lot of character customization (I mean classes, armor, and weapons)people who are persistantpeople who are willing to play for 50 + hourspeople who like medival fantasyPeople who wouldn't like dark souls 3:people who get angry easilypeople who don't want challengepeople who don't want to play a game for 50 + hourspeople who don't like fighting a boss over and over againpeople who don't like getting constantly invaded (by both real people and npcs)Alright not onto the tips list for dark souls 3Tips for new players:1. You should choose the knight class on your first play through it has some of the best starting gear and weapons as well as the highest health pool2. if your close to dying always pull back from enemies and use and estus flask (health potion esentially)3. Always use a shield if one is avalible at the begining and even the end of the game (unless your going for an ultra great sword build)4. always be cautious and make sure to watch your back and check surroundings you can be ambushed!5. ration how much estus you use on the bosses first and second phase.6. don't jump if there is a better way down you can die from fall damage!7. when in doubt always dodge from enemies don't just keep attacking8. enemies can ground around you can kill you, don't get swarmed9. some areas and enemies can be run through you don't have to fight them all!10. there are short cuts in levels that can take you back to the bon fire (make sure yo look for closed doors or elevators)11. If a wall seems like its in an odd place hit it it might be and illusionary wall12. Although armor doesn't matter much you shouls still always wear a set it gives you extra protectionSynopsys:For those of you who don't want to read the whole thing (I don't blame you) here is my summary. Dark Souls 3 is a great medieval fantasy game with great combat and lore. It is a very difficult game so don't buy if your not looking for a challenge. Try to start with the knight or warrior class to make it easier on yourself. Always watch your back to see if your going to be ambushed. The game is very fun to play but it is difficult and it will take a while to beat on your first playthrough. Also you should wait to buy this game, don't buy at full price wait until there is a sale. I hope you found this helpful and hope that you will buy the game because it is really fun.Thanks for reading (if you did),Dark Storm",1
Positive,"I am new to the Souls series, and I decided to start with Dark Souls 3. This game has no business being as great as it is, I feel that this title has a balanced amount of difficulty; the atmosphere is never boring; and the satisfaction that is felt progressing through the areas is powerful. I know that there are many Dark Souls veterans out there, but if you are a newcomer to the series I would recommend this as a perfect way to start your experience, and better yet, play with friends.",1
Positive,"9.5/10 Really good souls game. I really like the story and levels in ds3. Thers plenty of weapons to choose and cool looking armors. Both DLCs are very fun to play. PvP and invading is really fun to do.I think dark souls 3 is one off the easiest souls game to start and its good for first time players. I recommend to play your first playthrough solo and online ( dark spirits can summon to your world if you play online) Dark souls 3 is really fun to play and i recommend you to give it a try. if its too hard for you then git gud.But thers also some problems. i really like to invade and i do PvP a lot. But FROMSOFTWARE why is it so hard to do working servers? like why the f i have to play 95% against SA, NA and Japan,China and korea. also Australia? im from North Europe. 5% is from EU. yeah its so fun to play when host rollerblading and warping all over place and hit you from 30 meters away. its fun when enemy ping is 999. (salt level 9000) Really like to duel, but same problem (not so bad) 50% players lagging and hit delay like 1-3 sec most of the time. And still i enjoy the game, after all this. and yes i have a good internet.But wait! Thers more! Thers also hackers -.- a lot of hackers -.- like 5-10 hackers per day. and i mean those who do 10000 damage per hit, flying around, try to crash your game ( drop your fps to 0.1 whit some healing spell) those who have 1000000hp. yeah its a fun game, but thers those tiny di*k hackers trying to ruin your game. But all in all Dark Souls 3 is one of my favorite games of all time. Its sad that it is last Dark Souls game :/ we had a good journey. Now waiting BB2. And now buy the f game and go git gud you f casual!",1

Positive,"""This game is too hard"" lots of people are saying it, giving it the worst possible degree, but this game was made to be hard! It's not for casual players, but for ones looking for really hardcore challenge. I also played the first edition of this game - prepare to die - and it taught me that 3rd part will not be any easier, damn, it's even harder than first one, and that's why I love it!This game is not about mindlessly rushing fordward, happly slaughtering anything you'll see, by doing so you are only going to meet your death even more often than before. In Dark Souls series, every enemy needs to be taken on rather strategically, especially minibosses like Crystal Lizard or elite enemies like Black Knight - this enemy will give you a lot of pain if you underestimate him, as his 3 blows are usually enought to remove your guts. During this duel, you have to learn his moveset in order to beat him.PROS-Ultra challenging-Fighting system-Huge world-Amazing hidden story-Lots of connections to the first DS-Many possible builds-Teaches you to never give up-One of best TPRPG games I played so far-Crazy, unique bosses, usually with intresting story behind-Motherf- mimics-Dead enemy ragdolsCONS-Hitboxes. Goddamn broken hitboxes-Makes casuales cry-Cancerous builds in PvP, like two Greatswords, Estoc or Gargoyle Fire Spear, which requies no skill to kill you and it'a unbalanced with damage, attack speed and stuns-Overleveled players can attack new characters-Ganking",1

Positive,"As with all Souls games, this being one of the best, if not the best of them, a transformation happens as you play. You face an excruciatingly difficult boss fight and are pounded out of your wits. As you respawn on the last bonfire, surprised, confused and frustrated, your mind begins to work. You fight again. You die. You fight. You die. As each cycle happens, layers of truth as veils are drawn away until you finally see the beast for what it truly is. It is a puzzle. It may carry a flanged mace. It may have dozens of creatures alongside it. It may look so grotesque that it stays with you in your dreams. But underneath all the elaborate adornments, it is a puzzle. With each attempt, you discover its pieces, its patterns, until you unlock it fully and bring it to its knees. And the one significant thing that changed for the better was not your armor, your weapon, nor your stats. It was you.",1
Positive,"I've always been a fan of the souls games, and I was so happy to play this one. It feels so much more like a souls game than Dark Souls 2 did, and the password feature for online play is awesome. A Souls game you can actually play with your friends is just mind blowing.",1

Positive,Is good yes,1
Positive,"This game is more than just dying over and over. This game teaches you something about yourself. Persistence is key. You can fail hundreds of times, countless hours gone. But with each attempt you get a little closer to success. A little bit closer to understanding why you may be looking at a situation the wrong way, why you can't just go all in at once and expect to win. It also shows you that there are so many others stuck in the same way you are, each feeling lost - each on the border of going hollow. I could write for days to explain everything I've learned from this game. Know this, you won't regret buying or playing, but you may just find your own flame along the way.",1

Positive,"Not for the faint of heart: this game is ridiculously difficult. At times it can be mind-numbingly frustrating. Like, throw my mouse through the window frustrating.Note: You're better off playing with a controller. You can do very well with a mouse and keyboard, but until you master those controls, get ready to die at the first mob over and over again. and again. Until you think you can't take it anymore. Even with a controller it's still hashtag crazy tough, you'll just get use to dying a lot quicker playing with a mouse and keyboardThat being said, Dark Souls III is very entertaining, the graphics are phenominal and it has a ton of replay value. And if you're into PvP it has that too (in the form of invasions).Did I mention it's pretty difficult? When you finally get past the very first mob, you get to enjoy your victory for 8 seconds until you come across 2 mobs who continue to kick the snot out of you for what seems like an eternity.Give this game a shot if you like a challenge, you won't be disappointed.p.s.

Positive,"As a newcomer co the Dark souls series I jumped in to this latest instalment wondering ""What is all the hype about""Now I knowThis is probably the best game I've played in the last five years of gaming and marks a return to a more visceral and raw gaming experience where the player has to learn from his/her mistakes to progress. Bonfires acting as check points and areas resetting between visits as well as new game+ and an almost never ending array of secrets and puzzles make the game endlessly replayable. NPC quests without markers or a log to track progress forces the player to pay attention to what they are doing and make choices which have unforeseen consequences later in the game. Combat is smooth and well balanced and the boss battles all offer unique challenges with even the earliest boss in the game being a difficult one to overcome giving the player a good indication of what is to come. Controls on the keyboard however an nigh on impossible to use so a controller really is a must have for this game to get the full experience.

Positive,I have been an avid Soulsborne fan for many years now. after playing every game from demon souls to Sekiro to the surge and hollow knight I can confirm that this one in particular game still lives up to the standard it set. This is possibly my most favourite of the genre its series created. Most definitely recommend a play. Does thou even praise?!,1
Positive,"A good ending to the series, the architecture of the game is beautiful, Weapon Arts are just the thing, Quality of weapons and armors is gorgeous, and the new bosses and locations too.If you miss:- Poise- Powerstancing- Good PvP / Co-Op mechanicsDon t buy.Also, this game references and relies a lot on Dark Souls 1. This is the major downfall. Like instead of doing subtle refences or adding new content, Dark Souls 3 also recycled lots of content from the old series. Game only worth of buying with discount or outside Steam, else, just don t.",1
Positive,"Over 200 hours in and I still can't get enough of this game. The learning curve is steep and frustrating, but every victory reveals a little more of this beautifully crafted world. The wealth of weapons and builds makes it so that every playthrough feels new and unique. Every enemy poses a real threat to the player which forces you to respect even the most basic enemies, and makes it all the more satisfying when you finally find that next bonfire. If you love a challenge, I can't recommend this game enough.",1
Positive,I absolutely love this game! Dark Souls II left a meh feeling to me but this game brought back the great storyline that the original Dark Souls had and mixed in the PvP from Dark Souls II (improve on of course!) the surprises you get in this game was truly what made it so great!,1

You switch to halberd, invader appears with great hammer and destroys you. You switch to great hammer, invader appears with curved sword and destroys you. You go with pyromancy, invader appears with longsword and destroys you. You go with sorcery, invader appears with curved great sword and destroys you.

I believe anyone and everyone looking for a good game to play the Souls games are my top recommendation to anyone. It has an impossible to dislike world and the gameplay is beautifully accurate to a fantastical medieval setting. But most of all I think the story is the best part, it is mysterious and to get much of it and understand you have to really pay attention and actually seek information. This game and its predecessors are masterpieces.",1

I mean wtf, how can you see his axe coming when you are in a corridor.When you finish the game and start a new playthrough, the game feels way easier instead of being harderThe game is a unique dark fantasy . I give a general quote of 9,0/10This game is a unique dark fantasy that immerses you in a beautiful and hostile universe that wants to tear your skin and that requires a lot of concentration. If you've played Dark Souls I and II, you will not be disappointed with the third. I recommend the game for experienced players and fans rpg games From Software. Of course, I also recommends the game for players who are new and are willing to take on challenges that exceeds expectations.1 advice, if you die a lot against a boss, it's not because the boss is broken or because you're bad, when you fight a boss, learn his pattern and his combos. Use your brain and find the best timing to hurt the boss and make sure you can avoid every attacks after.",1

Positive,"This game is da best. The PvE gets easier later except for some hard bosses, but the PvP is decent. NOT AMAZING. I like how sorcery and miracles are viable in PVP though. I have a lot of fun in the fight clubs but they need a level in the DLC for actual invasion, because Grand Archives is probably the best real invasion spot. Good game though, balance issues are there in PvP but it's not terrible like DS1. Worth a buy for sure, great weapon and armor variety, good improvement over DS1. Can't speak for 2",1
Positive,"So I was playing some PvP at Pontiff untill I summoned someone who wanted to ruin the fun. He went into the level and I couldn't bother to give chase. Therfore I decided to use Dried Finger and summon another red phantom and ignore the party pooper. When I was about to win my duel the party pooper decided to say hello and give the final blow agaisnt my opponen, something I was not fond of. So I decided to give chase to this dude. He led me past the two giants and towards a ledge to sudden death. It seemed like he wanted his duel to take place there. I dumbfoundly decided to comply with this man's terms and a second into our duel he pulled of a Wrath of The Gods and knocked me over the ledge where I fell to my imminent death. I was not even mad. In fact I was amazed over the ammount of effort this one guy put into ruining my fun. Anyway that pretty much sums up my experience with Dark Souls 3. Can't say I was too suprised.",1
Positive,"Good sequel. It fixed a lot of the stuff that was wrong in Dark Souls II. Not to mention that the horrid soul memory system is gone. I still think that the first one was the best, but this one was good aswell. This game has probably the highest difficulty curve in the whole Soulsborne series, since the game starts of in a medium difficulty, and as you progress the game will get more and more challenging. Now I'd like to talk a bit about the bad things in this game. Well, I know, its still a fresh game and this can be fixed, but for now these are the facts that I dislike:-The poise. This stat was super OP in DS1 and it was ok in DS2. But for some reason they decided to destroy it in this game. It just makes no sense, if you apply logic, that you get staggered for ages when being hit by an enemy thats weilding a broken dagger. There's this ""hyper armor"" that you get while doing your weapon arts and so, but still, is nonsense.-The current meta: Well, meta hasn't really changed since the game started. Heavy weapons and greatswords are underpowered, and unless you dont know how to use them good, you'll have trouble if you go with strength builds and so. So yeah, you can pretty much figure what is the meta like. Any weapon thats not heavy (straight swords, rapiers, estocs, etc) is pretty much superior. The most popular weapons right now are the Estoc and the Dark sword, just because of their ridicoulous scaling and the capability of R1 spamming while still doing great damage.I hope they fix it in the future, but knowing From Swoftware, they probably won't.Anyway, to sum up: It's a great game, very challenging and good for players looking for something hard, tho it has some aspects that they need to fix.",1
Positive,Don't give up skeleton!,1
Positive,What seeketh th(r)ee?,1
Positive,"Try finger, but holeDamn i love dark souls, this game was awesome from the beginning to the end. I just love everything about it.",1
Positive,"Believe it or not, this is the second Souls game that I've played (Bloodbourne was my first but we can debate about that some other time). I tried DS2 but the port for the controller was horrible. I thought this was going to have a horrible port too but I was wrong; I was able to play as if I was playing in a console except with better FPS (as long as you have the specs). This game has gained a lot of patches and balancing updates since release, so I can safely say that you won't find much bugs and OP weapons anymore. FromSoftware keeps this game updated, and remember that the first DLC is going to come up some time this Fall. I've finished the game three time using three different builds. In other words, this game has a LOT of replayability factor because of one main reason: the variety of builds you can use. Once you get bored of PVE, there's always PVP. You will meet a lot of folks wether they be nice or not, it's all fun.The soundtracks are amazing. All boss fights will be etched to your mind by their signature soundtracks. Just starting from the main menu alone, you know you'll have eargasms all throughout a playthrough.For the story, I missed out on a lot of hype regarding the lore when I finished this game. It seems you really need to finish DS1 if you want to have a greater feeling of attachment towards the story, but other than that you'll be able to play the game and still understasnd it just fine.9/10 overall because the gameplay, story, and sountracks are superb, but the DLCs haven't arrived yet. I'm sure this will be a 10/10 once they do.Update:Well the first DLC has come (Ashes of Ariandel) so I figured I should update this. The DLC was absolutely breathtaking, albeit short. I'm not gonna spoil you or anything, but I should probably mention that you need the Lord of Londor ending if you want to get more interesting dialogues in the DLC. It's not that important but at least it shines a little bit of light about the characters. Here's my updated numeric rating on the game:Gameplay mechanics: 8/10 because poise isn't exactly back but everything else feels so smoothOSTs: 10/10Story: 10/10 if you really delve into the lore and read upContent: 9/10 because the dlc was too short but it gave really cool new spells and weaponsOverall: 9.3/10",1

Positive,"I thought it would be nice to write a review in support of one of my favorite game series, Dark Souls; having played all extensively apart from Demon Souls and its predecessor, Kings Field.So far, this game appears to be fitting of the shining professional reviews it has received. The gameplay is excellent, in that is designed to be very dynamic and faster paced than previous games to be a step closer the Bloodborne style combat (but not too many steps away from Dark Souls). The inclusion of special attacks and a bar which limits magic attacks has helped make play more varied and helps limit what is often considered 'cheesing' your way through the game.The method of storytelling is as always, awesomely opaque, with hints slipped into the fabric of the world for you to discover. The world itself appears to be a return to what people liked so much about DS1, whilst appeared to be the primary weakness of the second game (independent of the DLC, which seemed to be made more congruently). The game I would say is visually stunning in its environments, but also in its boss fights (par a few bad early ones). With a GTX 970 and a middle of the range processor the game runs reasonably smooth - and have only experienced one game crash so far from 100 hours of gameplay (and in its early days).Though I'm really pleased with the game, I am a bit disappointed with a few things. The replayability of the game appears to now be based on unlocking side quests, which makes your actions very consequential and likely will have to be planned with the specific purpose of completing these quests - which I do find quite annoying - as it seems like too much of a push to NG plus (though suppose it worked on me, having done a fair few playthroughs just for this reason - but still, I feel a bit cheated). The story is, however, excellent as always and remains consistent between games. There is a sort of meeting of features of all the different games into this one (almost like a love letter to all their previous creations); and appears to be a great send off to the series in this way.Unfortunately there is the subtraction of some things which worked excellently in DS2: such as dual wielding which seemed to provide more depth to combat; and the fight arena (though the latter perhaps done with fair reason so to make the game world feel more congruous and less disjointed which was the fatal flaw of the second game). They also didn't implement differences between new game and subsequent playthroughs (in the way of 'red phantoms' and increased numbers of enemies, as well as increased enemy strength) which was implemented very well again in DS2 (but not as far as I know DS1) and added variation and difficulty to further playthroughs with increasing challenge. In Dark Souls 3 unfortunately I am able to, with my learning and character progression, decimate most enemies on subsequent playthroughs which to me is a great shame.However, my main issue with the game and its implementation is, I think, the lack of a steam save - which though can be countermeasured using manual backups with a little bit of knowhow and Google Searching, is a bit of a pain and seems a bit poor considering cloud saves are implemented often as a general rule (even in games which require considerably less time investment).But to this point, having done a couple of runs through the game - I couldn't of asked much more from it (I usually moan at full price games, but it has been very much worth every penny), and I am greatly looking forward to its DLC (which, if anything like previous games, will be absolutely amazing). Keep it up, From Software",1

One of them says ""you've gone hollowed have you"" and then i got spawn camped by them for the next 10 minutes until i figured out how to parry and killed one which led the other into depression and made them fall on the floor and cry. I decided it's best to end her sadness and killed her too which gave me a good sword. GG 69/21 would recommend to everyone that wants to get into an RPG game. This being my first RPG game",1
Positive,"I have played all DS series and I feel DS 3 still managed to overjoy me. Great boss battles, challenging enemies, great scenarios, etc. The game itself hasnt changed much compared to its previous versions, but it stills feel pretty unique and the game mechanics have improved/evolved.Compared to older Dark Souls games:- Faster combat (movement feels a bit faster).- Casting and proyectile animations are MUCH faster.- Durability isnt an issue anymore.- Improved covenant system.- All weapons have skills/stances.If you liked previous DS titles this is a must buy.If you are willing to get immersed into the Dark Souls world for the first time, this is still a solid choice and be prepared to die a lot :)",1
Positive,This game is awesome and fun for my first Darksouls game. The only thing that I have a problem with is fucking invaders what the fuck shit this is so bad I would rather play CoD Infinite warfare for the rest of my life with how many times my friend and I get invaded when we try to play. other than that the game is great :)Gameplay = 9/10Story/Objectives = 8/10Invaders = Bullshit/10Kinda tired of invader bullshit with no way of avoiding it other than no embers (Can't play with friends) or staying offline. wtf,1

But the thing is, with this game you get the possibility of chalenging yourself bether than on any other game if you ask me. And if somthing ever was so hard that you can't do it yourself there is almost always a phantom somewhere to help you. So i mean this game is good and you should realy give it a try!",1
Positive,"my old review I left below for reference, but the many patches have fixed a lot of the game's issues and I am now quite happy with it, although I still think Dark Souls 2 was better for PVP.Dark Souls has always been about being hard but fair, Dark Souls 3 mostly stays within those bounds. Stunlock is a big part of the game now as poise does not function the same way it used to, they should have named it something else. As a result you can be stun-locked to death unable to move or retaliate at all by groups of enemies, so timing and group management is more important than ever. The new weapon skills and twin weapons are really cool, but power stancing is gone. Magic has been patched to be much more viable in PVP, but is still less powerful than Dark Souls 2 (although that is probably not a bad thing). Ganking is still a problem in PVP as the password ability had made friends grouping up quite easy and not everyone is honorable or skilled enough to want to go it alone. I prefer to goi it alone myself, you get much more of a feeling of accomplishment when you can take a group of 3 on by yourself. Fromsoft is working hard to balance the stats on everything better for PVP and end the cancerous estoc problem (dark sword isn't really a problem IMO). The boss design is not as creative as in the past on the whole, but is still really cool and some enemies like Aldritch are really neat ideas from a lore perspective. The story is much better than that of Dark Souls 2 and they now have 4 different endings which is a nice addition. I would now reccomend this game after the patches. 8/10only buy Dark Souls 3 if you want a PVE experience, the PVP is currently massively unbalanced as of this review (more than a month and a half after release and multiple patches). magic is useless (lmagic is somewhat viable now) in pvp atm and melee is the only way to go, greatshields are way OP (particularly havels shield), poise works correctly but is useless now (so stupid), and the estoc is once again OP as heck too. A big disappointment compared to Dark Souls 2's pvp experience. The PVE is pretty good, but I still think DS 2 was better. another big problem is seriously laggy pvp, getting hit by a blow that missed you by 10 feet is very obnoxious.sooooooo many more patches needed.",1

Positive,"All the other souls games are games that i normally dislike but i really love dark souls 3 the combat has been improved a lot from the other souls games and the progression and enemies are all really great, there are so many times where i raged my face off for one part of a area or one boss that I just can't beat.BUT the game is not perfect on the pc the thing that i hate the most is that all the controls and ui interaction are in xbox buttons so i had to constantly check the key binding to be able to play with a keyboard and mouse.Now i haven't had any issues as of yet with the game performance wise seeing that i have a pretty beefy computer.So all and all i would recommend this game to anyone that have a beefy pc and if you dont then you might have some problems seeing as so amny people have had some problems, but I would say to wait for the game to get better optimised before you buy it but its still a great game and worth a pick up.",1

Positive,"Pros:+ Amazing and rewarding combat+ Both PvE and PvP are incredibly satisfying+ Extreme replay value+ Visually stunning+ The Most Balanced of all Souls Games (on release) to date.+ Lots of throwbacks to previous games+ Great Level Design+ Interconnected Areas+ Incredibly easy to connect to friends, especially compared to previous installments+ Incredibly well designed and intricate bosses+ Lots of players can enter a single word, making for a large, chaotic PvPvP battle+ Backstabs are finally balanced, a very good compromise between DS1 and DS2 backstab mechanicsNeutral Points:+/- Very difficult, IMO the hardest souls game to date.Cons:- Framerate sometimes drops, though rarely.- Some weapons feel underpowered, while others are incredibly strong in PvP but utterly useless in PvE and vice versa- Much slower magic-casting times compared to dark souls 2, making it much less viable to play a ""Pure Caster""- It's ridiculously easy to miss NPC's which you NEED to find in order to do certain builds (i had to look at least 4 NPC's up on the wiki to find out where the f*ck they were.)And the most important Con:- ""Door does not open from this side""This game is an absolutely fantastic mix of Dark Souls 1's combat, Dark Souls 2's much better netcoding (than DS1), Bloodborne's tempo, a few mechanics and throwbacks from Demon Souls thrown in the mix, and top it off with amazing graphics and incredibly intrigueing lore. If you have played the other souls games front to back, be it dark or demon souls, or bloodborne for that matter, this game is definitely for you. If you tried another souls game but found it (a little) too hard or frustrating, or you have never played a souls game before, then i suggest you skip this one for now. Play the other Souls game to end. as FromSoftware really upped their difficulty this time around, Dark Souls 3 could be an extremely frustrating experience for newer Souls players. I give it a 9.5/10.",1
Positive,"8/10If you dont like games that frustrate you with their difficulty dont get this game. Its not a game that relys mainly on your reactions like super meat boy, its more of a unforgiving game where patience is key. If you go into a room and see a item in the center of the room use your brain, what are the odds that there is just a nice free present for you, no youll go up to it and get fucked by tons of monsters. This game makes you think about everything before you do it because you know at any moment you could die and lose some significant progress. By dying you learn and learning every time makes you feel like a god when you go back to an area you just died in and you dodge all these attacks. But dont be too worried their is co-op in a sense, you cant match directly with friends anymore like you could in DS2, but in its current state you really never go without help on a boss. But you can solo bosses if you want, the bosses have more health for each summon you get. adding up to 100% more health if you take 2 friends to help you.Dont assume that you will be able to beat each boss on your first try. All the bosses in this game take some time to get used to. This game is pretty hard and its to the point where you have to take a little bit more time in it, something i didnt feel in DS2. Dark souls 3 for me is a 8/10 it feels unfinished with its current netcode and optimization for PC. Dont get me wrong this game destroys DS2 in terms of game play and level design. Pros:Good match making (for friendlys)hard bossescreative bossescreative move setsinteresting types of weapons to usegood map connectivity and AMAZING level designThe story is there but its not forced down your throat taking in to mind that some people just wanna play the gamecons:invaders have no time limit and can seriously cause you to waste a lot of time because they wont let you progress. I have had a few times where they stand next to a huge monster and you cant go near them and then they just sit there and dont leave. poorly optimized, in its current state there is no real excuse for some of the issues people in the community are having with FPSLaggy PVP invaders, invaders pings are always so high that they are like teleporting and rubber banding. There really needs to be a system to check their ping so you dont have to deal with it.",1

Positive,"Edit as of April 21st: Turns out there was a large wave of bans that went out and a bunch of innocent people got banned, too. Well it sure makes a lot more sense why the rating is so low now.I'm in love with everything this game has to offer. For the first time since I first picked up the original Dark Souls, I haven't been able to put down the game.On top of that, I haven't read a single negative review that was accurate. Some have made fair points but most of them sound as if they wish the game were easier, which would really take away from what makes dark souls so great. Sure there are some bugs right now, but this is only version 1.04. Those claiming they are having connection issues probably have sub-par internet connection, as I have been invaded so much that its hard to beleive that i've ever been disconected.",1

Positive,"This game is amazing. Graphics and art design are just blowing me away here, From has crafted a beautiful dark fantasy! Combat is the best this has ever been and level design is a wonderful homage to Dark Souls 1 and 2. This may be the best Dark Souls game yet!FYI I am 20 hours in and am just at the swamp, maybe 1/3 of the way through the game? I like to take my time an explore and this game is the perfect game for that. I love the atmosphere, the strange and horrible and incredible things you come upon. The lighting engine this game uses is FANTASTIC just the light from an enemy holding a lamp makes a scene look cool. I was afraid this game would be all dark and grey but it is very colorful in places. When you die your soul echoes this time are represented by a glowing green orb that looks incredible floating by a stone staircase or whatever. This game is a halloween medieval fairy tale acid trip gone wrong.",1

If you liked 1, 2, and Bloodborne even, chances are you'll love this too. Combat is fast and fluid, graphics are, although not a killer, shines in many areas. The music will keep you motivated, as the epic haunting sounds of Yuka's score blasts through each boss. Buy it. You won't forget this journey. Don't worry, dying is a normal routine.",1
Positive,"So, in this review im gonna say what i saw in the game what i liked and what i disliked . I realy love this game and its already my favorite Souls game.Positives:So, i played the game in NG 6 and now here are my positive things . The world just looks beautiful . Every area in the game is just amazing and you get so exited whenever you enter a new area. Also whenever you progress you get rewards . You get extremly good items (depends on class) that are often usefull. In my opinion the game is much easier then the other games. I guess its because of the playstyle that they copied from bloodborne. Its much faster now and you can play without a shield with just dodging (but you dont need to). The bosses and also every enemy is very well designed . Every attack pattern from the different bosses is unique on his own way. Whenever you fight a boss you think you encounter something you never faced before ( like a guy who teleports or who is very fast). So lets come to the multiplayer part. The pvp is literally the best in every souls game . The covenants are great and they are all different. Like the sunbro covenant shows that you like to help people or with the aldrich one you defend him and his ,castle . And the coop yeah the coop is gorgious . I ve never seen such a great summoning system. Before every boss there are people who wants to help you or at the start of a area there are peoples who wants to help you to come to the boss. But now lets come to the negative aspects of the game.Negatives :I dont know if this happens only to me but for me sometime ( not every time ) the framerate just drops down for a moment and this sucks. Also it kinda sucks that sometimes you just cant summon peoples but its not a big deal.Summary :I played every souls and its just the best Souls game on my list. Im very imprest what FromSoftware did there. Even if the difficulty is much lower now its still wonderful . I m kinda sad that this will be the last souls game and i hope that eventually there will be another game that FromSoftware brings us. For all who played DS , DS2 or Bloodborne : Buy it its amazing. And for everyone who wants to buy it : Do it !",1

Positive,"The best thing I've played since Dark Souls 1. (No spoilers)Yes, there are a few issues technically and I've been lucky to not have faced some of the things other players have, but as the newest installment in the Souls series, Dark Souls 3 takes what we've come to love about the Souls games and stuffed it into a flashy new package. The combat is a little faster, maybe a notch slower than Bloodborne, over all it just feels more responsive. Every thing seems to have a nice weight to it. Combat still needs you to pay attention though and the enemies this time around seem more ""alive"" than ever; jumping, leaping and scurrying around to tear you apart. Having said that; maybe it's cause I've been playing Bloodborne everyday since the DLC came out so I'm ""on it"", but the first few bosses were taken down with barely an estus swipe on the first try. So that WAS a little disappointing. The other enemies scattered across the ares have been fun to discover and fight though.Setting wise; we all know that ""Souls lore"" is something you have to look for and piece together, but as someone who has played every Souls installment since Demon's Souls; there is a lot of nods to look out for and appreciate. I spent a lot of time just exploring and looking around enjoying the new game engine which looks absolutely beautiful. Everything from the environment to the things that inhabit it look terrifying yet great to look at. Dark Souls 3 is great for people you love Dark Souls and want more of it. If you have never played a Souls game for whatever reason, if you didn't like it before I'm not sure why that would suddenly change with this new installment. If anything the updated graphics will make your frustrations look prettier. But for fans of the series; they aren't even reading this review because they are already playing it.",1

Positive,"tl;dr: amazing game, servers are buggy, sorry for anyone having the crashes, get it when its updated and fixed.I can recommend this game, as I am not having any problems with crashes, low fps, or any performance related things. The only thing I can complain about is online not being accessible right now. I'm not sure if this is a widespread problem, but I was able to connect yesterday, and not today. I'm only assumming its because of the massive amount of traffic.Combat is as fluid as it ever was in the series, best feeling so far. There's a new learning curve that will throw players of the previous Souls games for a loop. Enemy AI is very aggressive, which is nice to see. Original Dark Souls' poise is back as well, which is all I could have asked for. A minor complaint is bonfire placement, but it can easily be overlooked. At some points, bonfires seem to be placed too far or close to each other, making one part of the area feel very easy, and the other part feel like a gauntlet. Bosses don't dissapoint, as there are actually interesting designs, mechanics, and arenas to fight in. Having only played the PC version for 5 hours, as well as exploring in the network test, the amount of content in areas is very dense. Having played only the first few areas, and gotten roughly half of the amount of weapons that Bloodborne had in the entire game, Dark Souls III makes a return to form in player choice on playstyle. Starting classes aren't solely specialized in Dex or Strength, or Magic as well. There are now what seem like hybrid classes, like the Herald or the Mercenary, being Strength/Faith and Quality builds respectively. Weapon Artes are also a staggeringly good addition to the franchise. Having more fluid and less predictable moves, along with being able to equip three weapons, make for a more engaging and intimate combat system, with PvE and PvP alike. Branching paths in areas, new weapons, and the wonderful addition of Weapon Artes make choice in this game extremely deep and engaging.Graphically, it's beautiful. It doesn't have the most polygons as other next gen titles. However, it has some of the most beautiful textures, use of depth of field, and overall some of the most interesting designs I've seen in a while. This game will most likely hold up graphically for many years to come. The cloth physics are amazing, character design and settings are beautiful, and lighting is gorgeous. The world is depressing and dark, but there are still splotches of beautiful contrasting colour found throughout Lothric. From the Giant Crystal Lizards azure sheen to the Undead Settlements stunning fires, the game knows when to throw a little bit of colour to keep your palette interested. Again, I've had little frame dips, no crashes, no low FPS. My graphics card is an nVidia 860GTX (2GB), I have 16GB of RAM, and an Intel i7, and am running the game off of an SSD. I would hope that no problems would come from a bit of a hefty rig. It's ashame that so many negative reviews are given out from not being able to play the game, as its amazing thus far. The developers do need to fix this however, and I'm sorry for anyone who has payed 55-60 dollars for the game, (or even more if they bought the season pass) and isn't able to play. My main qualm is sever issues. I've only been able to play online once. At first, I was consistently getting the message ""Unable to log into Dark Souls III game servers. Press 'OK' to try to reconnect."" I tried this for about 45 minutes before giving up. Then, later that night, it worked, and I was in the server. However, today I have been constantly getting the message again and again. I must have tried at least 10 times, giving each time 15 minutes. Its infuriating because I would like to enjoy PvP and Co-op with my friend. Although the minor upset about the server issues, this whole game is a masterpiece. I'm glad there are still developers who create more or less Triple A titles, and still put this much passion, polish, and content into their work. If you have any interest in this game, or RPGs in general, I would wait for the crashing/frames fix, and pick it up not a second later. It's a wonderful game that really doesn't treat you like an iimbecile, which is nice to see in an industry that treats players like idiots.",1

And there's already 6 empty beer cans next to the armchair, by the time the clock rounds 5.30PM.And the rug reeks of urine.Joking aside though.Dark Souls has a reputation for being insanely difficult. I'd rather say it's punishing and rewarding, as it's only as hard as you make it. You're rewarded for being observant, prudent and quick on the reflexes.Everything in the game is made to impress you, and in that sense, make you instinctively do the opposite of what the situation calls for. It's tricky.It's so nice to have Dark souls come with the polish of Bloodborne, and it seems to have cleaned up a lot of the little contrived things. A lot of things are more convenient, and it feels much less like you're fighting the controls before the enemy.It's gorgeous and the soundtrack is stunning right from the title screen.

Positive,"This game is trully a matserpeice when it come to PVE. Although, when it comes to the PvP portion, the souls series has lost its charm. When developing this game, there were so many people complaing about how Dark Souls 1 PvP was better then 2's, but what they failed to recognise was how broken it was back then. That game was filled with fliping Havels, gold tracer fags, and katanas everywhere, and it was broken as fuck. Yes, you could use the deamon's great hammer, if you were lucky enough to get a hit in on a glod tracer user. It was completely Dex based, and DKS2 actually fixed that. The PvP in Dks2 was balanced, a greatword could easily overpower a katana, if they knew how to use them. Fights meant something back then, every weapon had a balance to it (yes even the Ice Raiper [it was easy as hell to parry]). People failed to realise that it was a far better system, and it shows because people still play it reguarly and Dks1 doesn't even hold a candle to its popularity. Instead of seeing this FromSoftware decided to create the same broken ass system that was in the first game. It no longer concerns skill, just whoever has a faster weapon, thanks to no poise. Theres been a lot of arguments about leaving this out and I'm not going to get into it. That said, From can't fix this anymore because of the mass of players in it, so we are stuck with this horse shit. PvP means nothing anymore, and they knew it would from the start, because there aren't any arenas anymore. Besides all of this, in a PVE setting, this game is great, and I would recommend it, I won't the PvP though, it's absolute dogshit.",1

Positive,"9 / 10 Dark Souls 3 doesn t reinvent the series, but it s a great Dark Souls game that provides an excellent conclusion to the trilogy. It s the fastest paced combat in the series. It s almost a hybrid of the earlier Souls titles, and Bloodborne PC performance is excellent. This is not the poorly done port that plagued the original game s pc launch. All the equipment is useful, to a degree. Earlier installments saw the character receiving mountains of equipment, but only a small number of items would prove useful. Thankfully they struck a good balance with part 3. Rogue-like features of this game might be a turn off to some of the less adventurous players, but this shouldn t be a surprise at this point either. No ability to pause the game even when you re playing in single player offline mode. Apparently nobody on the development team has small children.3/31/2017 42 Hours Played More Game Reviews",1
Positive,"This is a review aimed towards those who are interested in buying the game and are new to the Souls series. If you are a returning player interested in knowing how it compares to the other two games, in my opinion, Dark Souls III is much better than either of the iterations, with more variety than Dark Souls II and much more balanced, fluid gameplay than Dark Souls and much less unfairness in its design choice. Though if you are a masochist that just wants the game to pound you, you may find it less appealing._Dark Souls III, and the Souls series in general is a game that is difficult to serve a purpose, and that is to test your human spirit. It is not insanely and notoriously unfair, but it does paint a picture of you as a simple human being, an insignificant mote of existence in a much grander universe. And it is your job, as the player, to prove to that universe that you are something, that you are capable of becoming powerful, that your human spirit, not your skill or your wits, will survive any arduous journey that they throw at you.This game is about surviving hardship, moral ambiguity and a dreadful, fearful world. It is about giving you a deep sense of wonder, and just enough tools for you to grow and learn as a player. The gameplay's ability to make you die quickly is not to frustrate you, but rather to make you very aware of your own mortality. And it is this awareness that brings immersion and satisfaction. When almost any enemy can kill you if you are clumsy or slipshod, every enemy that you defeat becomes that much more satisfying to take the heads from. It's brilliance comes from the level of agency that it gives to the player, whether you outskill a difficult opponent, or resort to cheap tactics and cheesing a for, both give you great pleasure as you learn the ins and outs of surviving in the inhospitable landscape. A player doesn't have to be good to beat the game, they merely have to be patient, and to be aware of their surroundings.Is the game fun? Yes. But it is often in a way that you do not expect, and it is difficult to describe why something that punishes you so harshly can be so engaging. It is not for everyone, but it doesn't take long to see the game's charm, once you survive the initial shock.TL;DR: This game excels in putting you in the zone. It is a trial of the human spirit, rather than a game to enjoy for the masses. But if that appeals to you, I strongly recommend this game.",1

Positive,"By far one of the best gaming experiences I've ever had. Masterfully directed, produced, and presented by artists that have mastered their craft and it clearly shows. My immense respect to the entire development team. I cannot recommend this game enough; play it now. 10/10",1
Positive,"EDIT: I DID IT! I FINISHED THE GAME! EDIT: Innocent people being banned. Unacceptable and really unfair. Though I'd recommend it if you DON'T PLAY MULTIPLAYER. EDIT: Five hours to complete tutorial.10/10 would die again Dark Souls 3 is a masterpiece. Graphically, it is flawless and also extremely beautiful. Having been this is the first Dark Souls game I've played on Steam, I was blown away.Let's start by what is in Dark Souls 3:+ Excellent gameplay, from what I have played, this game does not spoon feed you. It is fast and aggressive and will keep you on your toes. Along with this comes a clean, percise, smooth curve of difficulty which (may steeply) progress over time.+ The Details: Usually you'll find games that repeat the same things over and over again. This game does not. Each level is design in such a way to make your gameplay an unforgettable one. The world is graphically beautiful with on par level design. + Tons and tons of choices: There are loads of weapons and armor, making it open for new combinations to fit your style. + An amazing soundtrack, all I can say. The music is on point. (a1)+ Great emenies, bosses, and areas. Some areas are massive with loads of room to explore which makes a game a great game. + The Level Design. Just wow. - Personally, I dislike gank type appoaches. Dark Souls 3 did have somewhat of it with enemies. Although it is fun to hack and slash and dodge (and hold on to dear life) your way out of it, many people may dislike the approaches if they are not ready, new to the game, or simply unable to fight. - Playing with a kb+m can be utter chaos. However, kb+m is great for aiming (naturally). I didn't find many cons to it as a first time player, but there were a lot of pros (which is a good thing). Personally, I love games like this. Games that don't spoon feed you but throw the food on the ground and make you fight for it. I have to admit, this game is difficult, often frustrating at parts but I do love the challenge. Whether you are a fan or not, this game can and will blow your mind. Overall, Dark Souls 3 is truly a masterpiece. Graphically and performance wise, it excells. It has tremendous content to it and is difficult. As a first time player, I absolutely love it. And yes, I love to die multiple times then get it right just once.",1
Positive,best of the trilogy no doubt all my respect goes to dark souls 1 but this game is LEAGUES in front. Well balanced in all directions and immersive as fuck. Play it if you want or dont idfk.10/10,1
Positive,It made me suffer.,1
Positive,"through the dark soul, i alone am the ashen oneafter 100%ing this game, i can absolutely say that this game is a hood classic. the game never dips in quality and only goes higher and higher, ESPECIALLY in the DLC (love the ringed city, gael is EASILY one of, if not, the best boss in soulsborne). the weapons feel great, the bosses are all great to fight and wonderfully designed, the music made me wanna crank up the sound so bad that i would get tinnitus, fire keeper is an instant smash and the levels, although not the series best, are all fun to traverse and get progressively more interesting (boreal valley, lothric castle, archdragon peak, painted world and ringed city are all perfect). although not my first soulsborne experience (i 100%ed elden ring and ds1:R before this), had a good challenge but never felt impossible. the only flaw in this game is that you cannot sex fire keeper. so please, even if you're picking this game up and it's your first souls experience, do yourself a favor and buy it. even if a boss is whooping your ass too hard, never go hollow",1
Positive,"Not sure why my very old review got deleted. Dark Souls 3 is still the best of the Soulsborne series, and the Souls-like genre, to me. It's still playable today. Still holds up. You can still experiment with making different builds. Tackling the game in different ways, experimenting with PVP. The setting is still astounding to me. The challenges are incredible, yet rewarding, even after all this time. Sucks my original review disappeared. I had a lot more to say. All I can really think to say now is, the game is amazing. it's one of the best games you can play. Are there harder games? Sure. Are there other souls-like games? duh. But, this one just checked all the right boxes. If you like the challenge, and if you like the first Dark Souls game, you'll like this.",1

Positive,"Very good game but it is a little linear (or at least feels more linear from DkS1). Looks nice, controls nice (except for the input queuing that kept getting me killed but that's on me), good level design for each area, and the bosses were more than just dude in armor. There IS a gimmick fight and a few find the week spot fights but the rest were great. I wouldn't say it's better than DkS1 but it did improve some areas (except for the camera).",1

Positive,"Ahhh Dark souls 3 one of the best souls-like games that makes you addicted to dying and trying, you will be drowned of it deep lore and story, you will be amazed with the bosses design and soundtracks, Engaging in pvp or pve battles makes you feel like a real knight either having a big sword or small dagger doesn't matter what matter is how to use them correct, learn how to work together and make strategies with phantoms against bosses or players, Or you can ignore all of the above and play reckless",1
Positive,"Ah, Dark Souls 3. How I adore you. You are that type of game I always dreamed of playing and my only regret was not getting my hands on you sooner.To my shame I never played Dark Souls 1, but I did play Dark Souls 2. Compared to that one, Dark Souls 3 feels like a more streamlined yet overal improved game. Dark Souls 2 had a lot of very unforgiving mechanics, such as poison being way stronger, you losing max health every time you die because you're losing your humanity. Dark Souls 3 gave up that kind of stuff and instead focussed on the combat. The average enemy is easy to beat, you just learn their attack patterns and counter them, easy peasy. The boss fights are a lot of fun, as not only is each fairly memorable but each requires you to understand how the boss is going to attack and how you can counter them. It's a push and pull, give and take, where mistakes are painful and the game rewards you for paying attention. The pvp in Dark Souls 3 is, however, the true icing on the cake. It is a dance of death, where you and your opponent are constantly trying to outmanouver each other and punish mistakes. It feels like a slower paced fighting game, where unless your gear is truly awful the battle is decided by who is the most skilled, not by who has the best gear. In short, it's great, but you will notice that certain things that worked in Dark Souls 2 will not work here. Poison for instance is tremendously nerfed, and not nearly as deadly as it used to be, which is sad because it's just as easy to remedy as it was in Dark Souls 2.However, the atmosphere of the game really blew me away. The vocals are well done, each area is its own distinct sence of gloomy and ancient, and holy moly the music. Even today I still occasionally listen to some of the soundtracks cause I just adore them that much.Dark Souls 3 is a game I'll never forget. I'll admit, part of that is because of my personal preference, so consider me biased in that opinion. Even so, if you're even remotely interested in these type of hack-and-slash games mixed with rpg elements, Dark Souls 3 is a must-try.",1
Positive,"Every soul has its dark,",1
Positive,best game on steam.,1
Positive,"Dark Souls 3 was actually the first Dark Souls game I had beaten, and I think I know why. It's more of a linear experience compared to the first game, so you likely won't make a wrong turn when exploring different areas. That isn't a bad thing, considering it was the reason I didn't beat the first Dark Souls (at the time), I never had an idea of how close I was to finishing the game, or if I was making progress at all. Dark Souls 3, however, with it being more linear, it feels great due to it always feeling like you're making progress, even if it's just getting out of the area you're in to go to the next bonfire. With 204 hours (currently) on record, I can highly recommend this game as a must-play for people who couldn't really get into the first Dark Souls.",1

Positive,"The latest installment of the Dark Souls franchise, this gem is faster and more fluid than ever. While the freedom of the swift movement and combat feels amazing, and it has been a lot of fun experiencing all of the different weapon combinations, I do miss the purposeful and more challenging learning curve of combat that Dark Souls 1 and Dark Souls 2 held. In Dark Souls 3 the beauty of people emphasizing skill and forethought into how they will attack has oftentimes been replaced with whatever weapon is the ""cheapest"" to use and can be spammed to try to win. This is exclusive to the PVP, though, and not an issue at all with the environment and your personal experience. If you are very into PVP this is something that is easy to identify and overcome, and you can still have a fulfilling experience. You just won't be playing chess, instead you'll be playing tag. Still fun, just different.It wasn't my intention to lead with a minor gripe because this game is still an incredible experience that I have gone back to multiple times. Dark Souls has always been about the environment, the characters/creatures and bosses for me when all is said and done. The art direction is just as gorgeous and haunting as ever and some of the best boss battles and designs I have seen were contained in this one. The multiplayer was much easier this time around as opposed to the earlier installments so playing with others was not difficult at all. The gameplay, the aesthetic, the music, all of it was memorable and immersive. I definitely see myself coming back to this one again and again, happily.",1
Positive,Hard but fun.,1
Positive,"Well what can I say? I love Dark Soul and I had big expectations regarding the new installment. After a little bit disappointing Dark Souls 2, I was worried that Dark Souls 3 will be only a good game too. Thankfully, unnecessarily, because Dark Souls 3, the same as Dark Souls 1 is a masterpiece. Miyazaki delivers. The game is beautiful, may be not a technological breakthrough, but the artstyle is godlike. Some of the views are magnificent. Artstyle wise it s the best game on the market (IMO). The same goes for music. Orchestral score perfectly fits fights with huge bosses, and in my opinion, Dark Souls 3 has the best soundtrack when it comes to souls/borne games. When it comes to the bosses, NPCs and gear, I must admit that I m very pleased. The bosses feature great design, and some of the fights are one of the best in the series. It s hard to judge their difficulty as I ve been playing souls games for more than 600h. I love the fact that there re so many references to Dark Souls 1, as it s my favorite part of the series. Of course there re references to other titles too, even to Demon s Souls. Moving to locations. They deliver too. The areas are varied and feature many hidden paths and secrets. Some of the areas are located off the beaten path and player will not find them if he/she ll not look carefully. Of course the game has its flaws. Probably the biggest one is the net code. Very often one will not be able to summon phantoms, and if they manage to do so the phantom/s may be lagging. To sum up, the game is great and everyone who likes fantasy or looks for a challenging game should buy Dark Souls 3. For me the game is almost as good as the first installment, which I thought would be impossible (Dark Souls 1 is my favorite or the second best game of all time). I can only hope that the game will become even better with the upcoming two DLCs. EMBRACE THE DARKNESS!",1

Positive,"Amazing music, fascinating boss fights, stunningly medieval areas with a magical, or a sad touch. The difficulty is hard, but some people tend to overhype how hard it is. The main thing why I love dark souls is that it got the perfect difficulty. If you've played many characters, and played till ng8, you will still find this game challenging, but by no means unfair, or whatever word to put here.But don't think dark souls players who've put many hours into the franchise love it for the challenge alone. This game offers incredible gameplay mechanics, and a well thought balancing aspect. If I knew how much time I would spend into DS3 before I bought it, I would've bought it full price.

Positive,This is a good game,1
Positive,"One of the best games I've ever played. The world/level design is a bit more linear compared to the last two Souls games (not sure about Bloodborne, I've haven't played too much of it), meaning you can't really choose where you want to go for yourself, the game paves that path for you. Also, the multiplayer at its best is great, but at its worse it's.janky. Other than that I have no other complaints, this game is great.Disclaimer for mod enthusiasts: DO NOT USE THEM ON THIS GAME. I did and I unfortunately got banned for it, permenantly. It says it their EULA not to do it, even in offline, so this is a heads up for newer players to not make the same mistake I did and to use mods at your own risk.",1
Positive,"Originally, I was intimidated by the dark souls series. From the ""git gud"" culture, to the add campaigns which make note of the games difficulty.It is not that bad. If you persist, and are willing to die a few (or more) times, the game can be overcome by any average player. Dark souls 3 tends to reward observation and experimentation. The game tries to go out of its way to give you hints. For example, in the preceding level, you will often find items that buff your weapon with the element that the boss is weak to. Worse comes to worse, you can always summon. So, if we ignore difficulty, why should you play? It is one of the best action rpgs to date. The game will constantly present new challenges, keeping you engaged. Due to the amount of depth to the combat system, this can continue to hold you over multiple replays of the game. And while the leveling system will be underwhelming at first, you will eventually enjoy the flexibility offered by it.And of course there is the rush you get from taking down a boss for the first time. Because sometimes that boss can be pretty damn hard.",1

Positive,"I've always enjoyed the Souls series, the cryptic story and confusing level design never failed to keep me engaged. I enjoy difficult games, and getting my ass blasted (unrelated). The boss fights in DS3 are enjoyable either because the challenge they present or reason for fighting them. Some fall short and get overshadowed by others but overall I find myself remembering the positives a lot more then the let downs. I've played trough multiple times but I've gotten most of my playtime from PvP. Fight clubs and regular duels are some of the most enjoyable multiplayer experiences i've had outside of playing with friends. You may hold the spot as the fight club champion for and extremely long time, or stand against the wall swinging pickaxes with 4 others for no reason other than its funny.You will run into cheaters and people trying to get your accounts banned but they're not all bad, some will just try to have fun and show off. The addition of real duels and actual arenas were nice but I will still enjoy fighting on the edge behind Pontiff.",1
Positive,"Last year, before I left PC, Qlaag challenged me to a duel session, wich I won, 6month after I had already left PC, Qlaag told me he had improved a lot and was one of the best PC player.

It's brutal, punishing, but all that makes it more rewarding! I give this game a 9/10.",1
Positive,"Lets get one thing out of the way real quick - Dark Souls 3 is the best game in the series. What can you expect from a Dark Souls game? Death. Lots and lots of death. This of course myself and others have experienced throughout there time with Dark Souls 3 but it doesn't come without its rewards. A huge positive for Dark Souls 3 that easily seperates it from the other Souls games is how much more you can explore each area. Every time when I ventured into a new area I always wanted to know what would happen if I went in one direction but at the same time I wanted to go the other direction and see what was over there. A bonfire perhaps? Death? Treasure? A positive way to look around and see what you can find. While not without it's share of risk, the vast majority of the time there's always a reward waiting for you at the end should you be daring enough to take the leap of faith. With it's great exploration, the level designs truely shine here. From massive hidden levels tucked away, seemingly everywhere you do look, in one way or another you will at some point be visiting there. There were plenty of times that I found myself saying, ""Wow, THIS was here?"" after thinking it was just a fill in for the map. Everything has a purpose in each area. Everything. All the bosses are very good. While some will be extremely easy for a seasoned vet, there are some bosses that just defy ""sane"" in terms of difficulty. There are a few bosses in terms of difficulty that are just mindbogglingly difficult even for a seaonsed vet like myself but of course that joy that comes after finally beating said boss is always worth the dozens of death that came beforehand. Should you not wish to partake anymore in such cruelty, then as the Souls community says, you can always partake in jolly co-operation with other fellow members. \[T]/ - There are a few bugs here and there when it does come to summoning someone but it's not to the point where its rediculous. PVP is still as great, if not as good as ever. Other than sometimes running into a person with a terrible internet connection to the point they just skip all over the screen, it's a great experience to test out your might and gear vs other people all while being rewarded once more should you be the victor. The soundtrack to the game is fantastic. Each piece of music perfectly fits the ambient envrionment and creates this tense and dreadful ambience that you come to expect. Furthermore, where the soundtrack truely shines is during boss fights. It's absolutely incredible. The music sets the stage perfectly for each individual boss fight and that just adds to the already immersiveness when facing the boss itself. If I were to briefly give a bit negativity to Dark Souls 3 is that there are a few recycled bosses from previous Souls games as well as enemies but the vast majority of bosses are very unique and fun. Performance wise, I think that it could've been a bit better optimized even with system specs like mine matching and a bit surpassing the recommended requirements, I did hit a frame dip here and there in certain areas but for the most part the game ran perfectly smoothly. If your computer is somewhere in the middle of minimum and required, lowering the light and water quality helps alot in getting those frames higher. Pros to the game:+ Environments+ Exploration+ Soundtrack+ Epic boss fights+ Risk vs Reward+ Online PVP and Co-operation \[T]/+ Replayability+ The challenge is still there even for seasoned veterans of the seriesCons to the game:- A few recycled bosses and enemies- Could've been a bit better optimizedScore: 9.5/10",1
Positive,broke my controller10/10,1
Positive,This game is one of the hardest games i have ever played. I almost threw my controller after only 30 minutes of playing. I love it!,1
Positive,Best game I ever played,1
Positive,"Update:Its been over a year since this game came out and i have almost nothing to complain about anymore. So lets break down what happened shall we? Most importantly both DLCs are out now. They were both pretty awesome but i think some things could have been improved especially with the first DLC which was Ashes of Ariandel.This DLC introduced two new bosses. While the final boss of the DLC was one of my favourite bosses in the series i can't say the same for the second one. It was basically a copy of Royal Rat Authority from DS2 with addition of 3 wolfs and an npc. Only good thing this boss droped was an item called Champion's Bones which unlocks the PvP arena. And that was one of the main reasons i actually bought this DLC since the only way you can unlock the PvP arena is throught one of the DLCs. The DLC it self took me about 5 hours to complete. Its not too long but if you consider the quality and the time you can spend in the arena i would say it was worth it. The second DLC was definetly the better out of those two. I personally think its one of the best DLCs ever made and that DLC is The Ringed City. There are four new bosses and a tons of items varying from weapons, spells and even some of the coolest armor sets in the entire series. The bosses in this DLC are some of the best bosses in the souls series. My favourite is probably the Slave Knight Gael which is the finall boss of the entire DLC. Also Demon in Pain & Demon from Below is an awesome boss fight. Its a two stage boss fight in which you fight both Demon in Pain & Demon from Below in the first phase. Once you kill both of the demons they transform in to the Demon Prince which is basically stronger, more agressive version of the first two demons. Then there is Darkeater midir. Without a doubt the strongest boss in the entire game. It has insane on hit combo and extremly high defenses so prepare to get your ass kicked. First time i fought this boss i was on NG+3 and it took me about 3 - 4 hours to beat him. And then there is the Halflight, Spear of the Church which is another generic NPC boss. However if you play online you won't face the NPC but you will fight against another player. Which can be fun but if you are playing against someone with 500 ping its just pure annoyance. So yeah this DLC took me about 10 hours to complete. Mainly thanks to the Midir. But non the less its hands down one of the best DLCs to this day and for the 15 you pay for it you get more than enough content. To summarize things up Dark Souls 3 got a lot of the flaws it had patched. Ashes of Ariandel whilst short added the thing which this game missed the most and that was a PvP arena. The Ringed city was an amazing DLC which added some of the best boss fights in the entire franchise and gave the game an worthy ending which this series deserves. So for me Dark Souls III with the DLCs is 9.5/10 game.Old review: Dark Souls III This game is what you probably expect it to be, combination of Dark Souls and Bloodborne. And it plays out very well, yes it has some flaws but more on them later. Since there is a lot to cover i am going to split this review in to three categories - Gameplay, Single player and Online play. Gameplay Lets start with gameplay. If you played any other souls game you will be familiary with controls and yes there are some tweaks from previous game but its small changes you are going to learn pretty quick. Most noticable difference is that the game is more fast paced thanks to Bloodborne. Another addition to gameplay is weapon art and FP bar (mana). FP bar determines how many spells you can use and it determines how much you can use your weapon art. Weapon art is uniqe skill for every weapon. It differs from backstep with dagger to buffing your sword with fire for a period of time. Single player One of the strongest part of this game is its lore. Thing with Souls game is that most of the lore is hidden in item description so you should read them if you are interested in it. And best thing about this game is probably its bosses. Every souls game had great bosses but i am pretty confident to say that Dark Souls III has some of the most amazing bosses in ever. Online play As usual there is a co-op and PvP. Both of them stayed pretty much the same. Which works for co-op but not for PvP. Since the game is fast paced like Bloodborne magic is utterly useless and same goes for miracles and pyromancy (only exeptions are buffs) and that essentialy removes all of those elements from PvP. Another thing that is kinda annoying is a fact you can use estus as invader. Probably the worst part is that there are no PvP arenas. And don't get me wrong i like PvP in this game its just gets repetitive after a while. Overall rating All in all Dark Souls III is an amazing game with few flaws. Yes the PvP gets repetitive after a while and magic is useless but i don't regret single penny spent on this game. For me its 8/10!",1

Positive,lmao buy it,1
Positive,"I would highly recommend the souls series to anyone who loves RPG's, or hack and slash games(not that this is a hack and slash), but if you want a serious challenge; learning defense, and timing for each and every new enemy, fighting in your own unique way. Then get ready to have your mind blown as it attempts to wrap itself around this seemingly storyless game. You have to search every nook and cranny to find lore. but It's all there. An amazing story just hidden beneath the surface of this incredibly challenging, bloody, medieval(looking) undead battle for the ages.",1

Positive,Very challenging yet rewarding game. I know some will complain about it but I believe its better played with friends. The game still has some players but it kid of feels desolate at times unless you're in a high PVP area. There's times i put down my summon sign and i'm not summoned for like 20 minutes if at all. I like the new summon system that Elden Ring has it works much better. In 2024 I still highly recommend this game. It has aged well and is still a masterpiece.,1
Positive,"Dark Souls III makes a beautiful blend of wonderful locations and sad stories. Each enemy you encounter is unique and the NPC's that are scattered around really give you a feeling of ""hey, I'm actually not alone in this world"". Each place is wonderfully crafted, with breathtaking visuals and a background music that really fits each zone.Every place looks like it's out of this world (well, it actually is). Irithyll of the Boreal Valley must be my favorite place in the entire game. It looks like one of those amazing paintings and the ghosts that walk through the city are mesmerizing. Each place in this zone is beautifully crafted and the lighting system, combined with all the amazing details makes this place truly breathtaking. Every single area in this game is this amazing blend of surreal and fantasy and this is the reason why I find DS1 and DS3 the most poetic games from this trilogy.The combat is really what makes the Souls games stand out from the crowd. I can understand why people say that each battle is both hard and rewarding. Each enemy is unique and has this amazing moveset that will make you feel amazing if you manage to win, but will leave you speechless when you'll see the YOU DIED sign, wondering what went wrong. The bosses give you an epic challenge and each one has a story that you'll really remember. The Abyss Watchers fight is both poetic and sad. The music pierces your soul and even before you reach the fight zone, you can hear the battle that goes in the room. It kinda makes you feel good that you stopped the fight for good, gives you a sense of ""now you can all rest in peace"". The fights with Soul of Cinder and Salve Knight Gael (The Ringed City DLC) are both sad and rewarding. The music fits perfectly and you can feel the struggle of the characters. To me it seemed like each boss was glad that you won the fight, because you actually managed to end their struggle and this is what makes this game so immersive.The story gives this game it's depth. It was amazing finding lore bits scattered around the DS3 universe from the DS1 game and I loved each new story that was told. Each character has it's little bit of story and each line is delivered like an arrow. I love the fact that there are multiple endings and the characters quests give you an excuse to spend more time in this game. One line that really gave me goosebumps was from The End of Fire ending and it was the moment I realized that there is more behind the game than countless deaths and struggles. But one day, tiny flames will dance across the darkness . This line is so beautifully delivered, paired with the amazing cinematic and wonderfully blended music. Overall, yes, I really recommend Dark Souls III. It's an amazing game that rewards each perfect dodge and hit and actually makes you feel amazing with each victory achieved. You'll find yourself immersed in every zone and you'll struggle in every fight you'll encounter, but the whole experience is beautiful and the story beautifully unveils itself in front of you. This review doesn't come from an excellent Dark Souls player, because I'm really not and for quite some time I didn't really want to continue playing. (I started with DS1 and God knows how many times I rage quit because of Capra Demon.) This review comes from someone that gave DS1 and DS3 another chance and I gotta say that I'm glad I did. I would've missed some great games with amazing stories if I didn't. You'll both hate and love every part of this world that is beautifully crafted before your eyes.",1
Positive,I've probably played this game for over 1000 hours on all platforms combined (and including with mods) and it's among my favorite games of all time. Very replayable and my personal favorite of all the ~15 soulslikes I've played. The artbook is also amazing,1

After all the challenges, anger and frustration you feel when going through the game and even beating the nameless king for the first time by yourself is just pure joy. But when it's all over and those end credits play, you get put in to a depressive like state of mind and reflect on everything, maybe even shed a tear along the way and smile at the end. But hey new game plus exists for a reason lads and time to do my fourth play-through.Note: I played this game on console and did two endings on xbox and now I'm going to do my second play-through on the pc version and get a different ending.",1

Positive,"Dark Souls 3 is a triumph of the genre, offers the most challenging yet rewarding experience of all 3 Dark Souls games, it serves as a spiritual successor to Dark Souls rather than a sequel to Dark Souls 2, everything is just bigger and better, Graphically stunning and an amazing soundtrack also, the move and combat feel more fluid than ever and the bosses have more variety than ever, Again Praise the Sun 9/10",1

This was what kept me from playing any souls like for way to long. In short: the game is spectacular in every step of the way.

Positive,"You cant go wrong with Dark Souls 3.It s the most new-player/casual-gamer friendly Dark Souls title but still has a significantly high difficulty/Skill-ceiling combined with its DLCs. This was the game that really got the Dark Souls franchise rolling into Mainstream and for a good reason as well.Pros:- Fluid Combat and an amazing Magic system- Extremely memorable and Challenging Bossfights- Beautiful environmental Storytelling- A great set of new and returning Characters from previous games- The most active and polished PVP system in the trilogy- Patches the UnbreakableCons:- Very linear map layout- The first DLC is extremely short for its pricing- No Steam Point Shop itemsConclusion:If you don t own it, buy it.If you haven t played it, try it.If you die, try again.Nothing in life comes for free and being able to experience relief and freedom, you will have to undergo hardship and suffering. And the fact that so many people are willing to pay 60 bucks to do exactly that, shows that the game succeeds in what it s trying to accomplish.It s also just really funny to bonk mobs with a 2-meter wooden club.",1

Positive,"DARK SOULS 3 is a pretty good gamei have played elden ring sekiro and bloodborne prior to this and i still think they ae better than dark souls 3. The game itself is fluid with amazing boss battles and interesting characters, i was able to feel immersed in the story although it is confusing. I think this game can be recommended to poeple wanting something similar to elden ring and like the combat style. Some flaws in the game in my opinion is that it often feels very frustrating to get past bosses and the late game is really unfair, with even common enemies able to deal a ton of damage. it doesnt feel as strong as elden ring or bloodborne because some of its level design is really boring. The level design makes me feel very burned out and often i find myself feeling very done with the game. I would consider this game to be an 8/10. EDIT SOONalright after doing 2 endings and both dlcs, my opinion has changed abit. This game's DLCs are really good and makes up for some of the boring areas in the main game like 2 of the starting areas, but near the end it is really good and the dlcs are memorable and add to the experience. 9/10, what a game!",1
Positive,"This game is my favourite dark souls game. The main game is really good for a first time but if you are someone like me who replays it for achievements you realise how short it is (About 6 hours if you know what your doing). The DLC is what really made me like this game. The Ashes Of Ariandel was brilliant but my only complaints were there are only 2 bosses and it was about 3 hours in length. The Ringed City however was mind blowing. The NPC I summoned to help me with a few bosses was the final boss of this DLC and was trying to find something called ""The Dark Soul"" to paint a new world which links to an NPC in the Ashes Of Ariandel DLC. I don't regret playing this game for 60 hours. In fact I would play it even more if I found something else to do in it. 9/10 game. Now I am just waiting to get my hands on Elden Ring.",1

Positive,"My god. What an absolute masterpiece of a game. At first, it appears as though this is a PUBG style, bean pvp game. However, once you delve deep into the intricate lore of the beans and learn just how much severe PTSD and schizophrenia they endure on a daily basis, you then realize that this is not a game about fighting others. Its about the fight within. It's about the burning feeling of abandonment as you descend into a schizophrenic meltdown like the joker does after a talk show host is slightly rude to him. It's about harnessing the chaos within and doing everything in your might to contain it for the sake of all that is good and the safety of your loved ones. Or, perhaps you give in to the chaos and ascend to a new dimension of understanding. Perhaps you choose to lose the battle within, not because you knew you would lose, but because you wanted to. Perhaps you use the madness within you to exert the deepest of your wishes on these puny little beans, and kill them all. Starting with those you see hopelessly wandering the bean battlefield and then their wives, their children, their children's children, and so on through all eternity as you finally reach the final circle of hell as you realize you cannot go any further off the hinges. You realize there is no new way you can invent to kill a man or his descendants, and then you break down in tears as you realize the meaninglessness of it all. All those deaths, the bloody mist of all those beans, are on your hands. But then you ask yourself, will it ever stop? Will the voices ever stop telling you to kill? Will the suffering ever cease? That I'm afraid I can't tell you. You must find out for yourself.Overall 10/10 game. Would definitely recommend!",1

Positive,"I was stunned when I realized I never reviewed DARK SOULS III as it is my favorite FromSoftware game out of all of them. It's such a stark improvement from DS1 and 2 in so many ways! The combat is tuned to absolute perfection, every weapon and shield feels like it's its own beast and learning each one's intricate movesets is a joy to master. The game is stunning visually and contains my personal favorite location in the entire series. Each boss has so much love and passion poured into them and every single one has a different phase when erasing half of their health bar! I must admit that this was indeed my first Souls game, so there is definite bias there, but even after going back and playing them all including Bloodborne, there is no doubt in my mind that DS3 is Hidetaka Miyazaki's finest piece of work so far.The ELDEN RING hype is the highest it has ever been and I hope it's so good that it makes DS3 feel obsolete by comparison.",1

I think the difficulty really just adds to the overall aesthetic and feel of the game too, and the visuals look great. 100% recommend",1

Positive,"Let not my humble 31 hours as of the time writing this review fool you, gamers. I have, in fact, put hundreds of musky, testosterone filled, manly hours into this game. Hundreds of hours that could easily translate into a number of, as they say 'yo biches, leaving your lack luster game library havin' ass for I, a dark souls enjoyer. Fret not though, I will bestow unto you clear virgins my knowledge that will explain why you should become a man and buy this right of passage piece of shite. Why buy dark souls 3? Well, while I certainly went above and beyond in my play through as a naturally born woman attractor, this game, for feeble little children like you, review reading casual, is undoubtedly, the most casual of the souls games out. While the halving of your health mechanic for dying and or etting cursed may've been but a mere myth to us more refined players and of hardly any issue should we have ppffft *died*, it was definitively ""bs"" as the casuals put it. A ""harder for no reason"" mechanic that was removed from this game. In fact, there's hardly really anything to so harshly hinder the riff raff of newer players in this game. The difficulty of the souls series is -HIGHLY- over exaggerated. I know, i know. ""but god gamer extraordinaire"" i hear you say. ""that's so easy to say for such a prime specimen like you."" to which I say, yes. However, I dare speak against the beta males insisting this game is anything more than a trial and error simulator meant to test the chromosome count of every one who plays it. Mine, of course, being amongst the higher counts with the fellow divine beings given gamer bodies.Is the game a challenge (for you?) most likely, yes. Is it filled with unforgiving one off jokes? yes. But I wouldn't call that hard. I'd call it conditioning. Don't rush, explore, take it in. Get invaded, die and get feces tossed in your mouth from his back pocket after he points down at you, quit, swear you'll never play again, play again.In all seriousness.Please, don't let your friends and redditors fool you into believing this game is an unforgiving nightmare. It's not nice, but it calls you cute. It let's you know you did good when you do good, yeah. It'll slam your funny bone into a door frame after a few minutes, but it isn't all bad.This game doesn't require you to play the last two or demon souls to understand it. Why? Because this game doesn't try to shove story down your throat. They have your money, they don't care about making you read their writing. You can invest your desire to know what is going on in dark souls to whatever level you want. Don't care, see a cool boss, want to learn all of the lore behind it. Watch a video explaining all the theories v=because this game confirms 15% of the lore it shows, watch another lore video, watch all of vatividya's videos, self diagnose yourself with dark souls lore expert. Why should you buy this game? No one who isn't trolling or is legally allowed to wield sporks should argue that dark souls 3 is the most casually inviting of the souls game. This game is the most linear of them all. 2 gives you like 4 different routes to take at the beginning, and 1's entire first impression relies on whether you feel like exploring a gaveyard with funny skeleton mens or hike up a big ass hill to armored zombies with crossbows. Guess which route is gonna devour your virginity?There are so few things you can do to really ""ruin"" your run through of the game. Maybe you miss a quest line, maybe you murder granny who promptly inflates the prices on your violent trigger happy ass, but that's hardly anything to being able to destroy your hub area by killing the fire keeper in ds1 and turn the game to walking simulator.The hardest part about this game is online but let me explain the absolute lack of actual issues there is with it.Yes, invaders do have the entire fleet of enemies on their side, but they also have a max of 7 healing estus to your 15, not only that, you have way of the blue which let's you just summon people who (might) know what they're doing because the invader existed in your general zip code for 2 and a half seconds. and if all else fails, if you are backed into the corner, if you see the light at the end of the tunnel, if you can only do two things before you fade to oblivion.ALT F4 and hit the quan.This game is beautiful and the people are fucking atrocious. I like pvp, you will too when you discover ganking and a straight sword. I think everyone deserves a souls game experience form start to finish. so if you're okay with a challenge, maybe some frustration through some gimmicky or just dumb placement of enemies and items, I really do suggest this game. It's very straight forward, mods can assist you if you're struggling (more on that below) and I believe this game hurts me in ways only it can and still make me crawl back. Dark souls isn't easy but it's not like everyone who beat it is a fat wang swanging deity.TLDRThis game is wonderful. It's hidden story, the world, its design of armor, weapons, and bosses and such. Don't let the congested rambling's of the most aids people in a surprisingly cool and friendly community convince you this game is a waste of 60$ if you're not a competitive e-sports legend. I'll list below some suggestions for anyone wanting to play who want's to just beat the game and experience the world it's inFirstly, build.I strongly suggest quality builds, an even split between Strength and dexterity build. It lets you mess with the majority of weapons in the game and you'll never really run into an issue where the boss hyper resists you because of fire or magic defense. First, however, please invest in health when you start. Your weapons wont really scale with your stats until later when they're upgraded and you have more points in the category. 30 should be a good health pool for awhile. as for starting class, knight or merc.Merc- Spam your left bumper attackKnight- spam right bumpertrustI would also suggest keeping tabs on the dark souls 3 wiki and using it to track -Undead bone shard-estus flask these raise the effectiveness and quantity of your healing. so yeah.If you want, https://www.nexusmods.com/darksouls3/mods/607this'll take you to a mod that provides a merchant that sells pretty much everything for a soul, including a soul of a champion which translates to a -lot- of souls. It's both handy for if you dont wanna farm souls to level up after losing a bunch and getting to skip farming armor so you can enjoy looking at your depressed lump of violent ash. If you dislike the idea of clicking my link, you're racist. You can also just look for ""Honest merchant"" mod on ""Nexus mods"" if you want. This mod is also handy for your inevitable toe dip or full dive into the pvp of the game where you'll be sad even when you win. I genuinely love this game and its world design, I think everyone should experience at least one souls game and 3 is the most welcoming to a new player base. Between an abundance of bad players, items and strats to make bad players annoying players, and the lack of just obnoxious mechanics found in the other games, I really think this should be what every player just wanting to try a souls game should start with. If you like this, I strongly recommend bloodborne.Anyways, hope to invade, violate, and toss feces at you soon <3",1
Positive,Every souls has its dark,1
Positive,fart souls 3,1
Positive,"Phenomenal. This is a really great experience but you have to go in it with your mind open to the fact that you'll have to dedicate alot of time and effort to this game in order to progress, and its difficult to just breeze through it without somebody helping you every step of the way. You will not enjoy this if you rarely play and games but if you do often this will be no particular leap in difficulty.",1
Positive,"This game may take a while to get into but it has incredible things to offer if you're patient.I'd like to point out the amazing bosses first. They make Dark Souls 3 what it is for me. For example, the final boss has an incredibly huge arsenal of moves and many lethal combos that come along with a steep learning curve. But whenever you die, you can point out what you did wrong.A vivid environment, diverse NPCs and so many secrets everywhere give Dark Souls 3 a special touch I'm happy I didn't miss out on.",1
Positive,jus dodge lol,1
Positive,"- Dark Souls III, despite being the third installment in the Souls' series of games, could honestly be said to be a carbon-copy of the first. Dark Souls III as a title is nothing new in terms of storytelling, as it is the same formula of your character being 'the chosen one' destined to beat back the evils of the world and set back balance to it. The way that Dark Souls III does so however, is a far more interesting direction than initially presented. The world is dying and you are the consenquence of a failure, that, by all means, should never have happened. Without spoiling any of the major story-contents, Dark Souls III's story is nothing special by any means, but it makes up for it with having something that FromSoftware has always been great in, and that is its strong environmental storytelling, interesting characters, and lore that is easily left to the interpretation and imagination of the player. Dark Souls III is, in hindsight, probably the easiest Dark Souls game to date. For anyone unfamiliar to the series and starting out with it, it can be a very hard and bumpy road, as the enemies are ruthless, and unrelenting in their strength and speed. The Bosses are once more, also a creative distinction from the many enemies in the game, and are one of the most unique parts of the game, both in gameplay and in lore. I will admit that the first time I played through the game I was completely lost, as the game moves you from one locale to another at such a rapid pace that I had very little to really try and maneuver what in the fuck was going on. There are stages that definitely drag on too long and overstay their welcome, especially in really shittily placed enemies and mobs, specifically the Cathedral of the Deep. But once you move past that, or beat the game like I did and tried it for a second game, there is so much creative vision packed into this game that it doesn't even know where to put it all. Miyazaki and his team created for what it's worth a fantastic title that stands as a monument to the success of their company. Had it taken a far bolder and more intriguing storyline, this could have easily been another classic, but asides from that is already quite a fantastic title.",1

Positive,"fun but just doesnt have the same feeling as the original game. I do like the larger selection of weapons and all of the quality of life changes, but a decent bit of the areas in the game just feel so empty, in the sense where i just feel no emotion while being in them. Something that I liked in the original was how the map always wrapped back around itself, and you'd always be revisiting early game spots in order to progress when in the late game. This game just makes it so you explore, go through an area, fight 1-2 bosses, and you will never return, unless you want to progress some very specific npc questline. The game is fun no doubt and is admittedly a lot less janky than the original, but the map just lacks a lot of things. will definitely be finishing the game though.",1
Positive,"Originally bought this game for my Xbox One a few years ago - and I got all 100% achievements. I liked the game so much on Xbox that I bought it again for PC - and it's even better on PC! It performs way better (especially with 60 fps).The game is difficult, but it is worth the buy if you want a nice learning curve. Be patient with yourself.No one is good at anything when they're first trying something new.When compared to the earlier titles in the series - Dark Souls 3 stands out in my opinion as the magnum opus of the Dark Souls lore and core game-play. It's the smoothest and well thought out game in the series - it's sad that the series ends with it.If you're interested in achievements (like me) - expect at least 100 hours (unless you get carried)(It's okay to ask for help) No shame, check the forums. Finding the rings will kill you - Look up fextralife for guides.Fight hard and die well - give those invaders hell. And - make sure to kill the host if you're invading - it's quite fun.OoooOooooOOoOOooh Elden Ring. How long must we wait for you to release?Lest we all go hollow whilst waiting.",1

Positive,"The gameplay is amazing, the online sucks though. The game is worth for the PvE, but the PvP isn't for everyone for it's delay, but with time it becomes like a part of the game. The DLC is also worth it, so just get the deluxe if you buy it.",1

Positive,"What a way to end one of the best series ever made. This took everything good about the previews installments in the series and made them even better. My only complaint is that unlike in the remastered version of the first game the controls are from an xbox controller instead of a keyboard even though the game is on pc, which was annoying since you don't know what button does what but you eventually get used to it. Although the world is not as interconnected as in the first game it's a lot more linear and therefore easier to follow. The bosses are way more memorable and harder than in the previous games, with each one having multiple phases, as well as an incredible soundtrack, making it that much more satisfying when you beat them. I would also like to mention that I loved how in this one the bonfires were actually close to the boss, taking away the boredom of having to walk for a while to the boss every time you die (which was a big waste of time). Yet another masterpiece of a game as well as my favorite in the series. Once you get caught on it becomes very addictive. It was an honor to play this, thanks for entertainment!",1
Positive,I shit myself while playing this game.,1
Positive,I have spent 3 hours trying to make a good looking character just so i can put a helmet on and never see it10/10,1
Positive,"I got invaded, stun-locked, and then down pointed. 10/10",1
Positive,Good game to relax after a hard work day. There is a lot of friendly npc who will help you to pass cheerful locations. Plot is very hopeful and makes you feel happy. Good game!,1
Positive,All of my friends hate me for playing this game,1
Positive,Invasion is hard? Git gud. 10 / 10,1
Positive,Hard game but its fun in this game its actually kinda fun dying (except for when you die cuz the camera.) Imo the graphics look pretty good and the gameplay is really fun but online the hitboxes can be a bit wierd. bosses are fun and make you feel like a pro when you kill them. So if you wanna be/feel like an epic gamer this game is wonderful for that. a big recommend from me. :),1
Positive,big fun if you hate yourself,1

Positive,Fun but I also hate it,1
Positive,not the most difficult in the series but still tough and even better gameplay,1
Positive,"THIS GAME ALONG WITH EVERYGAME IN THE SERIES REQUIRES A LOT OF PATIENCE. My first game to start the series, said to be the easier of the 3 DarkSouls game and diving in i felt on top of the world completing the first tutorial boss without dying once through the run. Now however, im finding myself navigating through dangerous and dark winding paths unknowing to what lies ahead. as i get angry from the repeated deaths and attempt to take a break, i consistently dwell on the boss or foe i have waiting before me. yearning to extinguish my flame once more. tread carefully and choose your foes wisely. may exploring lead to shortcuts and bountiful loot. or certain death.",1
Positive,"One of the best games i have ever played. Dark souls 3 is one of the best game of the franchise. Honestly i couldn't stop searching for the lore of the bosses every second till i finished the game. It starts relatively easy but as you progress it shows how brutally difficult it actually is. Places are gorgeous and each of them have their own vibe. Weapon variety is much better than the earlier games and boss designs are amazing. As soon as i started this game i couldn't focus on another game until i finished it. It gets really cheap on a sale and as a bundle. I would recommend buying all the dark souls games, all of them are masterpieces.",1
Positive,the game is great and all.but i belive it's way more fun when my character doesn't decide to walk off a bridge and kill himself.,1
Positive,I didn't know a bonfire could look so beautiful,1
Positive,Best visual novel ever.,1
Positive,This is my first dark souls experience and its strange to start from the 3rd game but i just love it !,1
Positive,"Just brilliant. If you disagree, get good",1
Positive,"I died. I mean a lot! inside and outside of the game. Every bloody moment i wasn't playing the game, i was thinking how i could defeat the next boss, and once i defeated the game it was the greatest feeling. so, yeah I would say it's worth playingGood luck to anyone who tries to tame this beast of a game.",1
Positive,"After 200 hours, I've finished the game 3 times. In those three playthroughts I haven't finished most of the NPC's quests, I missed a lot of secrets and learned a lot from playing this game. If you are looking for a game that will take up a lot of your time, then Dark Souls 3 or any of the other Dark Souls games are the games for you, It's hard yes, but you learn to cope with it and push through the pain. Dark Souls is worth the money in my opinion, and if you are cheap like I am, wait for a special. The money you spend on this game is well worth it. Good luck and be safe, wouldn't want you to go hollow.",1
Positive,"For those of you that just want a run down of how it plays before buying: Its much faster paced than the earlier titles and feels closer to a Bloodborne reskin than the previous souls games. Armor helps in bits but I can only personally tell when wearing some of the heavier sets.Weapons are much more varied but the more unique magical weapons seem to be getting the short end of the stick with higher elemental resistances in enemies along the board and poor calculations for split damage types.Magic itself is still strong, but it takes a while to unlock most of the spells and less of them are found in the world at large. I know parrying is strong but they changed the window for it yet again so even if you can do it well in 1 and 2 don't assume it'll play nicely this time.And for those who are new to the series:I still think that the first game is an easier barrier for entry so go back and do that first.And if not then Endurance is your friend, blocking, rolling, attacking, picking your nose, everything needs it so always have lots.All in all, probably one of my favorite games, but still has some balancing to be desired.And as always, try to engage in some jolly cooperation for a better experience.",1
Positive,"Oh boooy, where do I start. I am beyond disappointed I started playing this game as late into my life as i did. Dark souls 3 has changed me for video game expectations. I will spend a whole night gaming just running around trying to find secrets/weapons/bosses/items/locations/ anything that little wild dark fantasy mind of yours wants is what dark souls is handing out. Like what the actual F*** never have i been more mad at a game not because of toxic community reasons but because holy s*** everything just wants to rip your head off and Ronaldinho kick that out of the world. You want a game that you can sink a sad amount of time into and tell your friends you ""have plans tonight"" just so you can go home and suffer dying over and over and over again <3 what a world we live in.",1

Positive,"By far the best souls game. The mechanics are amazing compared to dark souls 1 and 2. great bosses, boss design improved from the past installment and most of bosses are amazing. new game+ is fun and adds some content and it was very fun and challanging to beat new game+ 7(which is the highest new game+ to change something, everything above 7 stays the same)Highly recommended!",1
Positive,"Very good game, great challenge and fun.",1
Positive,I've got 40 hours on this game so far and it makes me want question my sanity. I love it. If u like a challenge this game is definitely for you. The satisfaction after beating a boss is better than a blowjob.,1
Positive,just step in the right directionsthis game to ez,1
Positive,"Don't be afraid of Dark Souls! It's not as difficult as the legends suggest. In fact, it's really not any harder than the average game, and for any bits you struggle with you can 'summon' other real players to join in and help out, including boss fights, which can make progress almost trivial sometimes.It's just hard enough to give a sense of accomplishment, and while the enemy placement can be purposefully challenging, the fact that they're always in the same spot, or following the same route, means that if you fail you can try different tactics until you beat them. Or, level up and head back when you're stronger.",1

Positive,"Between PS4 and PC I have about 4500 hours playing the darksouls series. Once you get the hang of the mechanics it's a very fun game, but learning can be hard. Stick with it and this game can last ages.",1
Positive,"The game and also all the two DLCs are amazing. Don't buy it without DLC, it will add very beautiful scenarios, with very nice bosses, amazing new weapons andddd the DLCs buying alone is way more expensive then buying without the base game. As the others dark souls, this game keeps the essence of learning by correcting your mistakes again and again and again until you master it. Another thing is: you will need a lot of patience. Don't try to rush and/or make the things quickly because you are out of patience. Instead, give it a break, take some time and come back to the game another time. You will see that in many cases you will be able to do that ""impossible thing"" with only one or two attempts after the break (or maybe not =P). IF you are really stuck, then you can try summoning someone to help you in some part of the game.Another tip is: try to find a character build on the internet that fits to you.I've played as a hybrid of swordman/pyromancer. It gave me the possibility of killing mobs in close combat with my Onyx Blade and also a very powerful attack with fireballs.And one last tip: this game does not have an auto save on the cloud. Be sure to save it manually on google drive or something like that before you format your pc or something like that. The save file location is: C:\Users\YourUser/Appdata(hidden)/Roaming/DarkSoulsIII",1

Positive,"Ok as a souls game fan for several years finally i am gonna write a review about this, which is gonna be obviously long as i am gonna talk about the entire franchise So for TL:DR users lets just be honest this game is challenging but very depressing at the same time lmao, like it gives you even more pressure than you already have, but jokes aside, this like MUST play games for any of em out there because its a different experience from other games 10/10 would recommend to anyone who has some chill xD So lets start from DARK SOULS 1 for me personally that game was ONE BIG GIGANTIC CHALLENGE as i was very new to this type of game like its totally different mechanics, i am that kinda person who rush my gameplay on RPG, and face several enemies at once, but this gosh dammit facing one enemy is hard enough, one careless move and BAM 'YOU DIED' gotta say i even broke my controller once, on this i mean yes its very tempting, but apart from that i started to love the game and its uniqueness, yes gotta admit i hated it in the start, as i couldn't play it well, but i learned how to play after several times ""START NEW GAME"" and then once i got leveled a bit everything was more fair than getting killed by FOUL MINION, so i would just say this game has a dark theme, very different mechanism from the rest so i give10/10 you all should give it a try SO LETS GO TO DARK SOULS 2 in dark souls 2 its all traps, not tough or intelligent enemies, its all FORCED TRAPS, like the devs wants you to die on different locations, LIKE BRUH NOBODY WOULD SAW THIS COMING WHEN YOU GET TRAPPED IN THE MIDDLE OF ONE WAY UP THERE TO GET AN ITEM and BAM YOU GET SURROUNDED BY ENEMIES, like wtf? i had no estus flask that time bruh, so yes i died MORE THAN I DID in dark souls 1, and the more annoying PART in dark souls IS WHEN YOU LOOSE A TONS OF SOULS BY DYING WITHOUT RETRIEVING. it HAPPENED A LOT ON THIS ONE but as i said it has its charm, and dark souls 2 isn't unique as dark souls 1 as i got used to the gameplay, but the bosses are splendid, thats the beauty of dark souls "" THE BOSSES"" would give 9/10Brilliant game but lots of cheap tricks to get you dieSO TO DARK SOULS 3More traps and More annoying enemies lmao and also ENEMIES CAN EVEN DODGE yo arrows, i mean when did enemies got that smart? like even a dragon dodge my ONISLAYER ARROW, do you have any idea how costly that is? stupid dragons anyways jokes aside, really loved that game man, i mean the game was fair to the least as people had experience from the previous parts, and also BOSSES ARE MASSIVELY unique and tough and there are two bosses which was the hardest, but i dont wanna spoil em for ya, so lets just say9.5/10 would recommendConclusion : massive, unique, irreplaceable gaming experience, you would feel you achieved something when you finish itthank you for reading",1
Positive,"Great game. Not the masterpiece Dark Souls 1 was, but certainly better than DS2. DLCs are good too. When you finish it, play Item Randomizer mod for extra replaybility (in offline mode, just in case).Edit: Cinders mod is great too, and it's becoming more and more interesting. The Convergence 2.0 is even better.",1
Positive,"Really fun game until you get invaded by people from different countries and the lag makes it unplayable. Playing co-op is cool but annoying it only progresses one persons game if you try play it with a friend the entire time, and doesn't help if they block you on ladders and take elevators without you, You know who you are.",1
Positive,"Dark souls 3. Played on both consoles and PC, one thing I want to say is playing with mouse and keyboard is not recommended, because PC version control is not converted nor its optimized for mouse and keyboard.Now for the game itself: this series is known for its difficulties, therefore took me awhile to beat the game, some bosses can be really boring such as yhorm the giant, you can only deal significant amount of damage to him by using Storm Ruler (A sword you can pick up near his throne). Combat is awful like other soul games, i hope they can make some tweaks on their next Souls game, because the combat is cluncky and unsatisfying, their latest game Sekiro does a good job of combat, so i have faith in them. Other than combat, i have no complain about the game, 8/10",1
Positive,"Dark Souls III is the Skyrim of souls games.Technically speaking, it s without a doubt the most fun to play.Yet, it kind of lacks soul (pun intended hehe) as it feels like a rehash of the first Dark Souls, but with Bloodborne s combat system and aesthetics.There are also no differences in NG+ but this is still okay since it's literally the same (but harder) game.In fact, even tho I just made a few criticisms, this game is FECKING AMAZING and the Ringed City DLC is the P-E-R-F-E-C-T ending to this epic saga.Final verdict:9/10 on NG; 9/10 on NG+;",1

Positive,"played a bit, alright",1
Positive,DS3 is by far the best in PVP terms and mechanics compared to previous installments of the game.However it is a lot more linear than DS1 and 2 which I think is a step back from the Metroidvania map design from DS1 for example.Graphics and overall flow of the game is faster paced and just feels smoother than previous games.Dark Souls series is a must play but it is not for the weak hearted players! :),1
Positive,"great game, better than 2 for sure. recommend grabbing a friend though, it'll make things a bit easier.",1
Positive,My favourite game of all time! I still go online from time to time and just help other people out. It's an awesome game with a lot of replay value.,1
Positive,10/10 favorite Dark Souls game so far. Although I still haven't played the first one,1
Positive,"At first, I hated this game.Then I shelved it for about a year. During that time, every now and then, I'd look up Dark Souls 3 videos on YouTube, and my little bro gave me some build tips.I started a new character and beat the game. It BLEW my MIND. It's now one of my favorite games.Dumped all points in strength, vitality, and vigor. Got Butcher Knife early in game.Hesitation is defeat. The game favors courage.",1
Positive,"This game is my new favorite game. And from what I have heard from my friends, is that it is also the best game in the series. It has great physics that require you to dodge left to right. And even after you finish a certain portion there are still more areas in that portion to explore. And it is very challenging and fun. And it is also fun to play with friends. But you can't just connect like most games. In this game one player has to have an ember and activate it. Then the other player has to have a summon symbol to place down. Then you both enter a password and have the same settings. And the player with the ember uses the summon sign to summon their friend who then comes up as a phantom. So it is a great game and I highly suggest it.But it is a little expensive",1
Positive,"I used to be a Dark Souls 2 Veteran from Xbox 360 a long time ago when i was 13 years old. I never thought i would come back to the Dark Souls Franchise but until i saw Youtube video's on Dark souls 3 and just by looking at this gameplay, it looks really fun. I had to wait a long time to play this game because life's hard without money you know? But Thanks to a close Friend of mine who bought this game as a gift for me, Played Dark Souls 3 for the first time. Let's just say i love it / addicted and i also hate it because i'm constantly dying and losing a Ridiculous amount of souls. Really after dying to all this Monstrosity in the game, in the end it's very rewarding. I would personally give this game a 10/10 and I would love to recommend this game to others.",1
Positive,"Great game. Upsetting how it shoves you into doing new game pluses (I'm on ng+++++ on my main character), but never loses what makes it enjoyable. I liked it so much, I got both DLCs, which I recommend you get if you want more from this game.",1
Positive,"After playing many hours of this game I can say I personally love it. Despite the fact that I personally consider this game to be the worst of the Dark Souls series. That isn't to say I don't like it and this is of course my own opinion. This game is clearly designed by the developers to be as close to the original Dark Souls as it can without perfectly mimicking it. That fact aside this game is gorgeous. The scenery still astounds me to this day and one can definitely not deny how much love the developers put into not only the play area, but the areas both out of bounds and in skyboxes. It's always fun to grab my binoculars and slowly explore through each region, paying attention to every small detail as I go and discovering something new that I had never before seen in all my time playing. The gameplay is challenging and fun. I remember when I first played through this game and I encountered the first boss for the first ever time. I remember not struggling as much as I had thought I would, although admittedly I had watched a multitude of videos on the game previously. I remember getting lost at the High Wall of Lothric purely because I was too scared to proceed in case I lost all of my souls. I eventually played through the whole game with a full squad of four friends and I bought the DLC and completed that with them too. I remember how much fun I had doing that and how much I still wish that it had never ended. The combat is tight and plays well. It is complex and strategic. Each battle can play differently than the next and everyone's combat is different and unique based on their play style. It requires careful thinking and well-timed dodging and keeps the player on their toes. Despite the Souls games being commonly viewed as rage inducing games, they play very well and can be very enjoyable if you take the time to play them and go in with an open mind. I truly value this series as one of my most favourite game franchises of all time and it doesn t look like this is going to change any time soon. Thanks for all the great times From Software, keep them coming.",1
Positive,"dark souls 3 was my first game into the souls series and let me tell you, this was one hell of a journey. the game is definitely hard without a doubt, but with enough time and focus you can overcome just about anything, and that's what i love about this game. for me personally i played very passively, took my time and grabbed items, and this game took me around a month and a half to 100% complete the base game and both dlcs with about 224 deaths in my play through. i highly recommend this and it is absolutely worth the full price, consider it only a bonus if you pick it up on sale.",1

Positive,Harder than dark souls 3. (?),1
Positive,"I could not get more than a few hours into Dark Souls I or II. I am inferior to the remainder of the human race. Dark Souls III is one of the absolutely best games ever, It doesnt tell you that though, you have to figure that out for yourself. 10/10 100%",1

Positive,"I have not played the first Dark Souls.I played Dark Souls 2 for like 60 hours or so, got halfway through NG+ and stopped playing.This game is heavily addicting, if you enjoy hard games, or games that take a while to get used to, then you will love this, it is a challenge, it will make you rage, but it's worth it. The amount of lore and complexity behind the NPC's is outstanding, there are so many callbacks to things from their previous games, even though I haven't played the first tone I have seen plenty of videos to know about all the bosses and lore. I plan on doing so many playthroughs of this game, as I am currently on my second one and am getting 100% on it so I can blitz the game over and over after, it's so good, and I would recommend it in a heartbeat, get it, you won't regret it, or you will and then come back and get good so you won't regret it.",1
Positive,"Geme is simply great. From pve to pvp. I like the fast paced combat and ability to spank ganks likenever before :3. The only thing i miss from previous games is the feeling of unease when walking to new location or some ""exotic"" weapons which are a bit lacking here. Also this is the most straightforward game in whole series. Every mechanic is pretty easy to comprahend which also takes away that feeling of discovery from previous installments. All in all despite Collision detection still being a bitch sometimes and servers not always keeping up with the action this is the third best game in souls series FAR better than ds2 and quite close to ds1 and D'sS. I recomend for everybody especially new players. Git Gud and praise the sun. :3",1

Positive,"Dark Souls 3 is (as the name suggests) the fourth game in From Software s Souls game franchise. It s an action RPG game published by Bandai Namco on 24 of March in 2016. The game s marketing implies that it s really hard, and only for real men , but it s that really the case? That s what i m going to find out here.The Gameplay.The gameplay of DS3 is pretty much the main thing that scares most people, while in the same time attracting more of them. Why is that? Well, as I wrote before, the game seems to be really hard at first glance; attack animations are really slow compared to other games, all of the enemies are at least twice as big as you, and the first boss in the middle of the fight transforms from an armored guy to a giant demonic serpent. All of it s purely designed to make you feel hopeless, and when you actually conquer the challenge, you feel like you ve just did the impossible. Most of the bosses and enemies aren t really that challenging, you just need to memorize most of the attacks, and have at least decent reflexes. The most brilliant thing about this is, that the game likes playing with you in boss battles. For example in most games an enemy would attack you twice, maybe throw in there a suprise sweeping attack, and then stop allowing you to beat him. However, in Dark Souls, a boss would strike two times, then follow it up with a sweeping attack, and when you think you have an opportunity to kill him, he ll hit hit you with his elbow, or kick you. It creates really tense fights, where you have to expect everything, and dance through like a master swordsman (or swordswoman). But, of course you know that the game isn t only made of boss fights. For me the real Dark Souls experience comes from exploring the the various environments we encouter in the game. They are great, not only are they visually appealing, but you have to be constantly cautious of your surroundings, avoiding the traps (there s a lot of them), and killing lots of enemies ranging from a normal zombie-like guy, to a abomination made from thousands of human hands and a woman s deformed head in the middle. That s what I love about From Software s games, you re not just exploring common dungeons with a straight path leading to the end. No, you re trying to survive in a crumbling underground city filled with abominations placed on every corner to suprise you, and just barely making it through them just to realize that you ve been killed by a rock falling from the ceiling. Add to it that some chests can eat you, random players can invade your world to kill you, and you have one of the best designed games since the last From Software s game.The PlotDark Souls 3 s story is one of the most convoluted stories I ve ever had pleasure of experiencing. The only thing you re straightly told is, that you re a some kind of undead who has been raised to kill 4 Lords of Cinder (whomever they are), and throw yourself into a special bonfire to prolong the Age of Fire . It sounds confusing doesn t it? Well, if someone s really interested, they can uncover all the lore from talking with various characters inhabiting the world, reading item descriptions, or just looking carefully enough at the environment. In conclusion, the story is hidden enough fo you to miss it when you re not interested, but interesing, and original enough to be speculated by hundreds of thousands of people across the world.The ConclusionI think Dark Souls 3 is one of the best games I ve ever played. It s ingeniously designed, difficult enough for you to actually pay attention while you re playing, and fun enough to keep you interested even in the weaker moments of the game. The only bad things about it I could find are mostly related to the balance of some particular weapons in multiplayer, but they re just minor things compared to the rest of the game. In the age of video games becoming much easier, and centered only about making as much money with low effort put in, it s really good to see a high demand on a game such as this; a game that s original, challenging, masterfully designed, and just fun.",1

I doesn't mean that keyboard and mouse are sucks but this game is designed for controller, having a controller will enhance your gaming experience, but I just don't like controller lol.If this is your first soul game, you might be me, f*ck by boss so hard until you feel like regreting buying this game. Please don't give up, after you get used to it, you will ask for more. :)Each of the boss fight is unique, I like that all the bosses have second phase, and everytime it gives me a feels like ""Aha! You're dead!"" become ""Aha! I'm dead."". But still, fighting a badass sh*t is so f*cking cool, each time you defeated the boss will give you a sense of achievement and motivates you to continue your journey.Overall - 10/10One of the best rpg game I've ever play, never get tired of the thrilling combat and super challenging gameplay.",1
Positive,"Dark Souls 3 combines the best of exploration/adventure with non-stop action. What sets this apart from the previous titles of the series is the polish in both gameplay and difficulty. The game feels just hard enough to keep you engaged into its own rhythm, but also not too easy for you to breeze past. The original Dark Souls stands in stark contrast with its unrelenting difficulty. Dying in the original Dark Souls felt like it was the fault of the game's design, where trial and error was the only recipe for success. What Dark Souls 3 does well is that doesn't hit you with a boulder from behind for you to anticipate the second time. You can actually see the boulder coming, and it's up to you to avoid it the first time. The exploration and attention to detail is what will keep the player coming back for more. The story is ambiguous and a lot of detail is left open for the player's own interpretation of certain events. Exploration is heavily rewarded with not only items, but also a better understanding of the game's world. Multiple playthrough is encouraged to fully complete the game, and the different character customisations makes even running through the same areas just as fun as the first time.",1

Everything is great the visuals, soundtrack, bosses the content, I could go on about how great this game really is. Playing this game just instantly made me a fan of the whole series and a fan of the company that put this together. I have played every dark souls game and I recommend all of them as much as I do with this one. But this one was special with me since it was my first one to play. There were so many good times with the game. It's sad I can't enjoy the game as much since I have played so much but I try to have a lot of fun. Of course the difficulty is brutal but that is what it should be and trust me you will have fond memories about running to the boss gate for the 1000th time. Dark Souls is now my favorite video game series thanks to this game and has made me a big ass nerd-fan about this game. Do I recommend this game? Yes I do.",1

Easily one of the best games I have ever played.This being my first game in the Souls series, I knew I was in for a challenge but saw it on sale a few months back and though f*ck it. No regrets to this day and am now in the process of going through this masterpiece for the fifth time. From the first boss to the last (with a few hiccups along the way admittedly, namely Deacons of the Deep and Ancient Wyvern ), I felt challenged beyond any game I'd played before and rewarded with some of the best visually designed unique weaponry throughout gaming. I also am amazed at the sheer diversity you are allowed thougout the game. Just a few basic examples would be a simple strength build, full of large but hard-hitting swords and axes; dexterity build with plenty of rapid slashing curved swords and daggers; pyromancer, with a surprisingly diverse arsenal ranging from your standard 'fireball' to 'sacred flame' which involves grabbing an opponent and releasing a large explosion within their chest and of course, sorcerer, with a huge range of unique spells to tackle any foe from range.I cannot recommend this game more to someone looking for an amazingly designed challenge and who didn't want their controller in one piece anyway.",1
Positive,"Souls borne games are an acquired taste and Dark souls 3 is a great entry point. The combat seems difficult at first but when you get into it you'll quickly see that it is more puneshing than difficult. It rewards methodical acting over button mashing. After you got into it you rearly feel like you died because of bad luck instead every death is a result of a mistake.The world is absolutely beautiful in a dark fantasy sort of way! People growing into trees and disgusting slime creatures that used to be human in a beautiful gothic castle litt by a setting sun.The story seems bare thread at first glance but quickly becomes very deep if you even slightly look for it. Defeat the bad guys and safe the world quickly becomes an exploration of all the characters you meet, their factions and the world itself.After the initial shock of ""dark souls games are to hard and stupid"" the series quickly become one of my favorites of all time!

Positive,"I'll be honest and say I've never completed any Dark Souls title.To put that into perspective, I have a total of 414 hours put into the Dark Souls trilogy, and I don't intend to stop. Dark Souls has a little of something for everyone - Visceral, action-oriented combat is just the bread and butter. There's online play, which can be both jovial intrusion or terrifying invasion. There's the joy of building a 'perfect' character, only for it to be batted away like a fly by a boss, or the self-imposed challenge of making it through every area without using any bonfires. There's nigh-impenetrable lore that's been layered up over the trilogy and is an absolute joy to pick apart, and there's just enough drip-fed to keep you interested - you might seek out a boss' armour or weapon to get some more tidbits about who they were before the events of the game, or you might stumble upon a character from a previous game's gear and find out how they met their demise. The Dark Souls franchise is often noted for its difficulty, but I feel this is incorrect. It's certainly tough at times, but it's not inherently hard, as most challenges can be overcome through simply throwing more time and effort at it - can't beat a boss? You can grind more levels to either get more damage output, HP, or even boost your stats to allow you to use a different weapon which is more suited to the enemy, or you could instead use those souls to purchase different equipment, perhaps you get Embers to increase your maximum HP and allow you to summon allies, or perhaps you get some Lightning Pine Resin, so that you can add the boss' elemental weakness to your weapon, dealing more damage. Perhaps you just get a different shield, one that's stronger against the element the boss happens to be using. No matter what it is, you can always tackle things in a manner that minimises difficulty, and that's what people who say Dark Souls is ""hard"" don't think to do. Of course, there's a certain degree of difficulty and mechanical mastery called for, and unfortunately the first boss in the game presents himself as a sort of gatekeeper, as you CANNOT level up or change your equipment AT ALL until proving yourself to him, and this often creates a bit of a misunderstanding in players. Regardless, for the most part - especially concerning the 'core' areas/bosses (that is to say, excluding optional areas/bosses that were intended to be a challenge and nothing more) - the game is very fair and allows you the opportunity to scale the 'difficulty setting' as you wish. Overall I consider Dark Souls III - and indeed, the entire Dark Souls franchise (yes, even Dark Souls II, as much as some dislike it) to be a wonderfully-entertaining ride that's always fun to come back to - either to give the game a shot from a different build, or to simply muster up the courage to continue and avoid becoming Hollow.",1
Positive,"Killed by tutorial boss a dozen times.Anxiety creeps when you reach a new area.Generous online players that help your enemies beat you to death.Proud and happy for finally beating a boss on the first try. then gasp in horror when the same boss comes back alive. in much stronger versionYep, I will definitely play this game again",1
Positive,"I'd say this is better story wise and gameplay wise than DS2, however it is lacking in the PvP department due to lack of balancing and extreme lag that occurs more often than not. I love the game, however it lacks some of that wonder, confusion, excitement, and despair that DS1 had, and that DS2 managed to capture some of. I never felt in DS3 that I could just step back and appreciate the game and what I had accomplished in it. The world of DS3 is very flushed out, but the faster pace is something that allowed From to slack off on the interconnected-ness of it all.Excellent game, and for sure worth my time, but the nostalgia can somewhat ruin it.",1
Positive,Best character creator ever made get it.,1
Positive,BUY ITS SO REWARDING,1
Positive,Best game for me!,1
Positive,"This is one of the best, most engrossing, mysterious and rewarding games I've played in almost 15 years of gaming. The lore is deep and rich, almost reaching the heights of other inhabitants of the high fantasy genre, yet staying shrouded just enough for the player to reveal at their own pace, and the games immediate story, while simple, is incredibly thought provoking. Level design is sharp and smart and enemy's are challenging. The combat is rewarding and consistently shifting, and can prove to be immensely satisfying, given you have the time to give this game, as there is undeinably a learning curve. But most importantly of all, this is the first game I've ever played that's made me realise something very important about myself: I'm not very good at video games. But if anything can, this is the game that will change thatTime to git gud, 20 deaths at a time",1
Positive,"It's impossible to mimic the exact feel and wonder of the original Dark Souls, as everything after will be, by definition, reiterations of the same concept with improvements. That said, FromSoftware has honed the Souls formula to near perfection, retaining the excellent worldbuilding and lore that the series is known for, and streamlining some parts, like weapon upgrades, to help the player get back into the game faster. Boss battles in this installment are the best they've ever been, with music that accentuates every encounter and gives each battle a distinct tone and weight. The addition of Weapon Arts makes each weapon feel a little more unique, forcing the player to consider more than just type and damage output. The areas are a little more linear this time around, although they are beautifully designed, and the first DLC area is a bit of a letdown in terms of content added, but what's here is unforgettable. Definitely worth every penny.",1
Positive,"""Bell tolls"" - SPOILERS! Woken up from the ashes to nail the old lords to their thrones. To bring back fire to the world, is this our destiny? The legend of the dark soul? The pilgrims found the truth in the ashes of the past. ""The fire fades"", but note this ""The lords go without thrones"", means all lords not only the cinders. But the dark lords as well, those who held to the dark soul of man, in a forgotten kingdom ruled over by kings of men. But whom this kingdom was shaded from a dougther of Gwyn himself. Just like a mirror of a world named the ringed city.We set out on a quest. To kindle the same flame just as the souls of cinders did before us. Supposed to believe that this is our destiny, our duty and our right.When we enter the painting of a rotten slip of cloth carried by an old slave knight. We find our self in an alternative universe. A painting made for those who have no place to kall their own. A place left to rot, only to be reborn by a new painter after you have set it aflame.We start to believe that the soul of man can be connected to the abyss the eternal dark, and that the flame is connected to the lords.We have fought undead, beasts, demons, dragons, lords, and kings. Used their souls to regain strength and even used our friends in our battles only to see a curse being downed upon them. While our own curse is still whaiting and crumbling in the backs and bones of our unkindled flesh. I ask again ""IS THIS OUR PURPOUSE?""But we are not alone.In the final battle in a place long forgotten, beyond the end of the world we seek Gael. The man who went out to find the pigment for her lady. And he did. He found the old lords of men, even before you do. He found the pigment, the dark soul of man. But he is not the champion nor the legend to bear theese souls. Gael knew this, but his loyalty stays with his lady, and this old slave knight manages to take the final step to give his lady her pigment.You however kill the tainted slave knight gael and takes the souls of man and the blood of the dark soul. Then you finish his quest for him, and gives the blood to the lady in his stead. But you dont tell her his downfall. Instead you get the honor of naming this new world. The world i named has no name, but it will be ""a Cold, Dark and very Gentle Place"".There is only one lord and only one curse. And they will never die, but reborn from the ashes again, and again, and again.Untill the dark settles. Then tiny flames will dance across the dark. Just like an old, long and forgotten tale of lords and men.",1

Positive,"I am rewriting a review as my past review I had not even finished the game yet but was already in love with it. Since then I've finished the game multiple times over, done all the endings and am close to all the achievements and aiming for that. I must say I think I've experienced what Dark Souls 3 has to experience and it is good. First of all I want to say that only 80% of people have beat the first boss and only 20% have gotten to the end (steam achievements). Which I guess you could use as an indicator for how challenging people can find these games. Although please do not get discouraged! This game will not hold your hand but this is part of the experience. You have to figure shit out and you will die in the process! But once you complete the game at least once, doing it a second time is so much easier. You will have some very challenging moments and people will often tell you to ""git gud"" which may seem like an annoying comment, yet its so true, all you need is to get good and learn how to play the game well, which will naturally come from experience and dying.THE WAYS YOU WILL EXPERIENCE DARK SOULSI want to point out there are different ways of playing this game. I don't mean ""you can be a pyromancer, you can do this blabla"", I'm talking COOP. I've experienced this game many times with many different people, and I've raised a lot of Dark Souls players which I can proudly say have grown up to be some pvp legends. But playing with friends is a different experience to alone. Playing alone is scary, painful, and requires patience. When you play alone for your first time, you don't know what you're doing, where you're going, and you're mostly dying while being confused as to what to do. I can imagine a lot of people getting discouraged to continue if this is the case, but please keep trying, the feeling of overcoming a boss or finally finding the next bonfire is amazing. Playing with friends on the other hand, is like a cake walk. On my first playthrough my friend had also just gotten Dark Souls so we were figuring things out together. When we did play with each other we didn't know where to go and we still died to bosses but having each other made it so much more fun rather than painful.BUT! Since then I have played with many other people and held their hand through the game. This wasn't intentional as I knew everywhere to go, so they'd follow me and that's kind of how the game would play, I'd guide them through the game. I've asked my friends and have had mixed opinions about this, as to me, experiencing it when you have no one to tell you where to go is the best way to experience Dark Souls. My friend however, said he got bored after being stuck in the first area not knowing where to go. Then I come in I'm like ""come play dark souls"" I hold his hand, I lead the way, we kill bosses I give him tips I feed him the lore, he beats the game and he's like ""wow that was fucking epic"". It was epic, but not as epic as when I played and it took me 60 hours to beat it as it took him only 30 including all the dlc and bosses which were not yet released when I first played. To me guiding players is too easy, I want players to experience the frustration I felt when I couldn't kill a boss until I finally did and had this sense of achievement, this voice in your head saying that you finally did it. Although, if I wasn't there to hold my friends hand he wouldn't have known how to do all the quests and in a way experience the most out of DS3. It's a hard concept of two sides, as on one hand I felt it was too easy for him and on the other I'm glad I was there for him to experience the wonderful stories being told that he would have most likely missed. Overall it's up to you how you want to play and experience this master piece.This game is amazing, if you have the will or some friends to play with, do so. You're missing out if you don't. This game also has an amazing pvp scene with so much depth and variety, there's nothing like the feeling of winning invasions of winning a duel. If you have friends this is even more of a reason for you to play.",1
Positive,"Well, I was sceptic about this game when I heard for it for the first time. Saw the gameplay, still sceptic. Until I tried it!

Positive,"What an AMAZING game. lthough i finished the first playthrough in 15.30 hours it still filled me with joy and happiness in the end.The music is absolutely to another level especially in some bosses but overall its a great feeling fighting a boss and hearing a bgm that suits it.The enviroments are stunning and i must have spent a lot of time looking around rather than killing bad guys :) Its just and awesome feeling i don't know how to decribe it.The bosses are absolutely tough and the game somehow tells you from the very first encouter of a boss that you must learn how to play,think carefully,memorise your enemy's moves learn the dodge or else you want survive Dark souls 3 till the end.These are the top 3 things for me in this game to say.I can say more about the variety of weapons,shields,rings,Armors or even more but i don't want to get in depth with the game because it will boring for this review.Overall this is my second Souls game and i have to admit it was my best game of 2016.Highly recommend it to new guys at this incredible series.Remember to keep your patience and PRAISE THE SUN!",1
Positive,"My first game of the Souls-Series.I really like it, it is tough to defeat the bosses. You have to workout strategies and use the right weapon and buffs against the bosses. Also there is a big diversity in the weapontypes. I prefer UG-Sword + Shield or 2 G-Sword, just because it looks cool xDI bought DS 2 now and I never regret to buy this game. It is the kind of game I wanted to play all the time of my life.I saw Bloodbourne on PS before I knew about DS, sad but true. And now I am a huge fan of this series, it is just awesome.Just buy this game if you have patience and a huge amount of tolerance to die many times.In my opinion this series is the second best of all time after Age of Empires.",1

Positive,"Dark Souls 3 holds up as a worthy sequel and ending to the Souls trilogy (sorry Demon's Souls). Dark Souls is a brilliant series that's had the greatest impact on video games we've seen these past 7~ years, or perhaps ever.Amazing singleplayer experience that ends the trilogy on a high noteIncredible amount of fun to be had with friendsMemorable boss fightsMultiplayer is made 10x more fun by covenantsRuns on the same engine as Bloodborne, looks amazing on max settingsMuch quicker, visceral, satisfying combat in both PvP and PvELaunch issues fixed over time (crashing, bugs, unoptimisation). I feared I couldn't run this game with a GeForce 750 ti, but it runs very nicely on medium-high settingsActive patches and updatesArguably weaker PvP than in previous games due to quicker healing, certain weapons and very common phantom gangbangs where it's one invader vs the host and three phantoms. I enjoy it mostly but I can see why people are upset about itNG+ doesn't add very much apart from some new item placements and scaled enemy damage/HPWhere the fuck did poise go!?DLC is unpromising, since Ariandel was so shortArmour is no longer upgradable and shields are pretty uselessAt least a million pointless or unneeded DS1 referencesDS3 is great fun and is worthy of a lot of praise, but I feel it struggles to find its own identity and offers a weaker post-game experience than its predecessors. Regardless, it deserves a 9/10.",1
Positive,More easy than DS2:estus can be restored during combattitanite has easy chance to farma good list of armor sets and weapons for any purposeBut each boss has a bit better list of abilities and there are only few non-unique bosses.PS. There are four different endings. Try to catch 'em all!May the Bonfire be with you!,1

Positive,"A great game to end a great series, this game has its flaws but the pve is by far the best part. The multiphase boss battles and well placed enemies make for a difficult yet rewarding experience. Some major changes to pvp mechanics and equipment stats have severly stunted the games multiplayer longevity though. But to someone who wants to play the dark souls 3 pve experience solo or coop I would definitly recommend this game. Beware though, dark souls 3 will destroy newcomers. I suggest starting with ds1 or 2 if you are new to the dark souls series",1
Positive,Cannot be compared to the gorgeous Dark souls 1 and 2 pve.Cannot be compared to the fun pvp of dark souls 2Beceause Pve and pvp is not good. it's just a beautiful game. But Miyazaki cannot surpass dark souls 1 at all.I still recomend it beceause it's a good game on it's own.But the sense of adventure in dark souls 1 and 2 is not there.,1
Positive,"Dark Souls 3 is an action rpg set in a dark fantasy world, the story in this installment is connected to the previous games. You play as the ashen one who is awakened by the toll of the bells, which signifies, that the link of the first flame is threatened.The first flame is responsible for a lot of things in this game, when it weakens the world starts to get upside down.The story is actually deeper, but I couldn't tell you more without spoiling you. So you leave your tomb on a journey to find the flame and solve the issue. In this journey, you'll have to face many enemies and bosses that each have their own behavior that you must carefully study, if you don't want to die, this setting enforces a tactical approach that you most likely will take some time to get used to, it is what makes most of the game's charm and difficulty though. The game's backstory is explained via object descriptions. So basically to understand the whole game, you have to collect every item, read each of them and then put every info you have collected in order, hopefully, some courageous people in the community have already started working on it thus you can simply look for some explanations on the web to learn about the game (obviously,there's a risk of getting spoiled and not everything is certain!).I will now list the pros and cons that I've found (might compare some elements with the previous games)Good Points - The interface was greatly improved, the developpers finally explain in detail what each stat is for.- The soundtrack they added is majestic, it blends perfectly with the stages you are in and builds immersion.- Very smooth and dynamic animations not to mention the graphics.- Some old armors were ported and cool new armors were added.- Estus Flask - Ashen Estus Flask convertion (Health Flask and Mana flask, you can balance how many you want.)- Improved Covenants (factions)- Merged fighting mechanics from Dark Souls 1 and 2- Large variety of weapons- There is a lot to explore and side quests are rather entertaining.Bad Points- Hitbox can be messed up in PvP and allow your opponent to damage you from afar, hopefully though, there are some techniques you can use to avoid that.- Huge invincible frames from fast rolling.- Poise only works when you attack. (It's a stat that determines stagger resistance, in previous games it was always active.)- Miracles are almost useless in PvPConclusionOverall it's a pretty good game which I suggest you should take if you like difficulty and games set in a medieval dark-fantasy theme. I guarantee you that no matter how good you are at other games, you'll struggle against this one. You'll probably die very often aswell, don't lose hope if you it happens, just remember to ""git gud"", use tactics and rush less.",1
Positive,"Probably enough deaths to air GoT for 10 more seasons.Git Gud or Get GoT, 11/10 Dolphins",1
Positive,"Dark Souls 3 is perhaps one of the best modern games I've played in years. The visuals, the combat, the difficulty balance, the level design. All fine tuned points sharpened over the years culminating in what I can only describe as a masterpiece of modern game design. The combat feels very grounded as every enemy plays by the same rules you as the player does. Every area feels unique and distinct from one another from the decrepit Undead Settlement to the lowest pits of the Smouldering lake to the stunningly beautiful Irithyll Valley. All memorable in their own right. There's a diverse range of weapons and almost no repercussions for using them to your hearts content. Some weapons scale with strength, others with dexterity, but depending on how you level your characters you can softcap both of those without lacking in other areas. Sorcery, Pyromancy and Miracles however are more specialized as well they should be. But you can experiment with builds as you please.It takes quite a while to learn the intrigued combat system, the harsh difficulty curve starts as early as the first boss; Ludex Gundyr, but once you got the hang of it it'll feel so rewarding. Early areas could take hours upon hours to complete on your first run, but once you got some experience you'll breeze through it. Bosses and enemies have been balanced to be challenging but fair. Once you've learnt a boss's attack pattern it doesn't take long to take them out and the ones that do take longer will usually change up their attack strategy. This game franchise is often praised for it's difficulty, sadly I feel this reputation overshadows the quality of gameplay it has to offer.",1

Positive,"Without a doubt my favorite Dark Souls game, fluid combat and unique enemies. The bosses are fun and the amount of replayability is enormous. My only issue with multiplayer has been from the inconsistency of summoning signs, especially when trying to connect directly with a friend.",1
Positive,Review initially written at 219 hoursWhere to start.It's great. however. there are few major flaws in the game (pvp mostly) such as poise. Every attack staggers twice in a row before allowing a small gap big enough for a parry or roll but only for that.A good continue of the series.Much more of a sequel to Darksouls 1 than Darksouls 2,1
Positive,"Truly an astounding game. A beautiful set world with stunning sights, even more stunning enemies, and plenty of other amazing items to appreciate. While seeming a little short when running through multiple times, the game presents unique challenges and a wide array of enemies just like the other Dark Souls games. The PvP is tightened up with weapon tracing and hitboxes being spot on, better player tracking, and much less of those awkward backstab fishing moments. Overall, great game. No true complaints. Keep at it developers, you're doing great.",1

Lore is great, music is great.PC port is okay, it doesn't support 21:9 resolution which is a big frowny face from me.Also, why the f is equip load a separate stat from endurance smh.",1
Positive,absolutely the best souls game yet. Too bad i dont own in anymore. BUT BUY IT ITS AWSOME!Pros: Absolutely Gorgeous Graphics. Can run on Mid-End to High-End Pc's Lots of players willing to help you if you are having trouble with a boss! Lots of references to different souls games. (even bloodborne) Leveling system has improved since the first and second dark souls games. Cons: If you are new to dark souls good luck. If you get invaded good luck. If you get to the third boss good luck. If you start as a cleric good luck. You know what fuck it if you play this game good luck.p.s. I thought this game was extremely fun.,1

Positive,"This game offers pretty graphics, atmospheric and epic environments, lots of unique enemies and items, a fairly deep combat, co-op and pvp and a very good challenge.The most problems are with the multiplayer as there's occasionally lag and desync which can break the game.I'll rate 8/10, but if you ignore the technical problems and just look at the game design, then this game would get 9/10 from me. Getting 10/10 would require some design overhauls that would make the game less ""Dark Souls"".This is the best Dark Souls game.",1

Positive,"The game is friendly to beginners (more than previous games) but this does not detract from the series-defining difficulty, But This game does requires patience but it's worth it. I quite like the nods and references to previous games in the series also with the the scenaries can really amaze, great atmosphere. The controls are tight, the enemies AI is smarter and much harder to manipulate, in terms of PvE. so much gear and weapons to use. (Glad they brought them all back, bloodborne was too limited) All of the negative reviews state the game crashes. I have played 30 hours so far and not a single crash, i don't know why you play on a potato but we eat them here in Ireland.Yes there is Poor Mouse and keyboard support. that is because the game IS MEANT to be played with a Controller. just like DS1 and DS2,The only immediate advantage I can give DS1 is the sense of early game mystery when you had the freedom to go the wrong way to the Catacombs, or New Londo, right off the bat.Ps Truly the last Souls game? :(",1
Positive,"pretty fun to play this one solo or with friends, the co-op works well and invasions aren't too horribly often unless in a couple of bad spots (don't dried finger there unless you have a second friend waiting or it will be very hairy!).Not the hardest game in the series as 2 is so awkward its harder than it needs to be. Very solo-able, but challenging.Only on my 3rd journey but 5 is the goal! Good Luck to all that dare! haha",1
Positive,"Years from now, Dark Souls III is going to be known as the ""Ocarina of Time"" of the series. Compared to the previous Souls games: artifical difficult has been replaced by unique and skillful execution, quality of life nuisances have been remedied, and sound/visuals have been improved drastically. In a nutshell, the biggest difference in Dark Souls III is that you aren't being tested for your patience/discipline. DS3 tests you for your skill. In DS1/2, dying was infuriating, and winning was a relief. In DS3, dying is awe-inspiring, and winning makes you feel like a lord. I whole-heartedly recommend you get this game. As soon as I got it, I couldn't stop playing it (I put in 68 hours over 5 weeks while working full-time and going to school). It is not flawless, but it is a clear 9/10. It's quite a enjoyable and rewarding experience.Also, in your times of struggle, remember that every death is meant to be a lesson. The game wants you to succeed.MechanicsWeapons are extremely unique and most of them are viable in PvE. You get to just pick whatever you want and feel like the badass that you want. Boss weapons are not impossible to come by and often feel the best. There are also many more choices for each weapon based on their ""arte"", which are more than just a guard break or a lunge forward. The movement/dodge system is much faster and more responsive. This would be very OP in previous Dark Souls games, but enemies in previous DS titles also were hard countered by circle-backstab anyway. The rolls in this game are appropriately needed for the changes in enemy move sets. It overall just feels better just to run around and battle.The convenants and merchants are infinitely less cumbersome than previous. Discovering a merchant relocates them to Firelink Shrine, in which all merchants and most NPCs will stay. You won't have to go traveling for 4 minutes just to get your weapon upgraded after you buy some pyromancies anymore. Convenants are also joined by being given a Sigil following discovery. You can just swap convenants by switching this slot in your inventory instead of hunting down the convenant leader again. Also, a merchant dying no longer means that you lose their products. All in all, it is much less of a chore to do small tasks like these.The equivalent of being human is called being Embered. Unlike in previous games, this is actually useful (you get 30% extra hp). This means that more people embered overall = more PvP interaction. Also, you gain embered status for beating a boss, which means more people want to put down their summon sign to help out others with a tough boss. Summoning also has a level limit, so you don't have to be scared of getting invaded from someone light years ahead of you in levels/gear. All of these mechanics lead to greater and more meaningful player interaction throughout your time in Lothric.You get to warp between bonfires from the get-go, and you also don't have to upgrade specific bonfires. Some have complained that this makes the world feel a bit smaller, but I disagree. The world is extremely connected save 1 or 2 exceptions, and you can see almost every other point in the game from one another. Bonfires are also a bit more on rails, meaning that it's tough to miss one. Previously, hidden bonfires (especially in the Tomb of the Giants in DS1) could completely change the flow of how you play the game based on whether you stumble upon it or not. There's also a generally lower amount of arbitrary shit that would punish you for lack of prior knowledge.The weapon crafting system no longer punishes you for making a choice. You can simply swap the properties of a +10 weapon instead of having to find another one and go through the full upgrade path each time. The information about each weapon is much easier to process and there are more choices for whatever nuianced build you're trying. The menu overall is extremely good. You can finally navigate on a grid instead of a list, and you can tab between menus for your armor/weapons. You can have more rings and items equipped simultaneously. You can also view your status to see how many souls you need for a next level instead of stopping by a specific location. It is overall just much easier on the eyes, and it is optimized to provide convenient access to information.CombatThe bosses follow suit in the weapons improvement, and (with few exceptions) they all feel varied and deep. I've fought some bosses almost 40 times and will still see some new moves. The AI is also programmed well enough to show human tendencies like getting greedy or faking out a move. You would be able to look up a guide on these most bosses and still not find the secret to beating them. In previous DS games, it felt like you would cheese all of the bosses because they'd cheese you (just walk near them and stand behind every boss). Sometimes, you'll want to intentionally separate yourself from a boss as much as possible. Some bosses have moves to punish you positioning close; other bosses have moves to punish you for rolling as a reaction to anything. DS3 bosses have several move sets that keep it fresh several times over. I never noticed how terribly annoying previous Dark Souls bosses were (from walking to each boss to the small gimmicks and lack of tactics) until realizing how good it could be when I played DS3.Honorable mention is that the Final Boss is an absolute beast. He is the summation of all who have ever Linked the Flame; therefore, his fight is the deepest and most ""complete"" that I could say I remember in a video game. He's not this way because he just ""has a lot of stages"" or takes 30 minutes to beat, but because he contains every popular player build and you will find something different each time you play him. There is also a bit of an emotional moment in which the music for Gwyn, the original Lord of Cinder, plays and he begins using Gwyn's sword. Sometimes you feel so emotionally connected with him, that you almost don't want to win. The normal enemies are what you would expect, but there is fortunately a bit less mob behavior. I thought that mob behavior was a bit of a cheap excuse for difficulty, and the AI programming and enemy design has made up that difficulty in a more meaningful way in DS3. I unfortunately don't know too much about serious PvP, but my experience with the invasions mechanics have been pleasant when fighting another player. It hasn't really felt unfair at all, yet. Performance & Audio/VisualDrastic performance increase. 60 fps, unlocked resolutions (I played in 1440p). The draw distance is excellent and the environments are stunning. You will find several ""Oh my god"" moments in which you are greeted by amazing views en route to a new area. For a little bit of preview, look up the screenshots of Irithyll of the Boreal Valley. The armor and characters are also extremely sharp, and the in-game rendered cutscenes are Blizzard quality.The audio is overhauled. The directional sound in the game rivals Counter-Strike 1.6. The materials and general pitter-pattering is very precise and varied throughout. The sounds in the game are also overall very clear; play a bit of Dark Souls 1 and you will notice a staggering difference.The music is the best of any in the series. Several songs feel like a perfect fit for the environment/boss, instead of just sounding like generic background tunes. Pretty much any boss theme is great, but Abyss Watchers, Soul of Cinder, Pontiff Sulyvahn, Father Ariandel and Sister Friede (from the DLC), Twin Princes, and Oceiros get honorable mentions for great music. The Main Menu theme is pretty damn good, too.",1
Positive,"There appear to be major issues with the PC version on launch for a great many people - mostly issues with their graphics cards not cooperating with some of the features of the game, such as the lighting engine for example. Everyone should take this into regard before buying the game, and make sure to check for updates to see if these issues have been resolved. I can say that with a GTX 980 I have not had the crashes or FPS problems that I hear about frequently.I'm only 5.5 hours in at the time of this review and will likely update it as I get further, but for now this game has my approval. PC players of the last two games will probably assume that the keyboard and mouse controls are as much a waste of time as they were previously, and that's probably true - I never even bothered trying them out, but as usual all the button prompts assume you have an Xbox gamepad, and that's how I've been rolling.The combat is very familiar to players of the first game, and the use of the quantifiably superior Bloodborne engine means that the controls are not nearly as sluggish or unresponsive as they were in Dark Souls II, making for an altogether more satisfying experience where you feel like you're doing things right, or that dying is more the result of your own mistakes rather than terrible input recognition or nonsensical hit detection.The new weapon art system offers an interesting new dynamic to combat that probably puts this game closer to Bloodborne's attack variety than it does either of the previous Souls titles. However, performing weapon arts uses the L2/LT button, which means it replaces the Parry functionality in every circumstance except if you are using a Parrying-class shield. This, combined with the more fickle parry timing that feels more like DS II, means that parrying altogether feels less like a viable technique. This might be a blessing to some people who felt like parrying was broken and OP in the first game, but it also means the developers took the time to create a function that most people probably won't end up using.Dodging is more like the first game, in terms of its animations and more generous invincibility frames, so it can be used in a more offensive manner than in DS II as a way to maneuver past an enemy's guard and their attacks to land some serious hits. The way equipment burden affects rolling is virtually the same as DS II, however, meaning that your roll distance is what is affected the most as your equipment weight rises, until you reach the ""fat roll"" cap at what I estimate is around 70% burden.Upgrading weapons looks very similar to DS II but I have yet to max out or infuse a weapon to verify that. Upgrades require more individual titanite stones than in either previous games, for reasons that are not exactly clear, but I also feel like drops are significantly more generous. Infusion stones seem to be accessible more early in the game as well, especially Raw stones, which are helpful for starting players who don't have high stats to affect their Attack yet. However, infusing weapons with Raw or elemental damage means all stat bonuses for the weapons are removed, not just reduced or modified like they were in the previous games, so the drawbacks are more severe.Overall I feel so far that leveling up does not give you the same sense of power and progress as in previous games, and soul drops from enemies are not nearly as generous. This is a bit disappointing, but it also means you cannot just farm souls for an hour or two and then become an unstoppable killing machine with just a few extra levels under your belt. This game does demand more skill from the player rather than being able to min/max your character and turn each map into a cakewalk, or at least it seems that way so far.This game has my vote of confidence so far, at least as far as the gameplay goes. It makes only a few changes, for better or for worse, but really does feel more like the first game, with a dash of Demon's Souls and Bloodborne for good measure. It may not have as many surprises as people would hope for, but really, if they stuck to making DLC for the first game instead of making sequels, I'd still be buying that, so what's the difference?",1

Positive,"I've been sitting here for 20minutes trying to write a positive review for this game, but kept on ending up writing love letters to Miyazaki. It's amazing, it *MIGHT* even be better than DS1. Challenging but fair, tons of great bosses, interesting NPCs and cool equimpent. 10/10",1
Positive,"If you re a newcomer you might get stuck at Gundyr.If you re a casual gamer you might not keep up with Pontiff.If you re a veteran you can still get tilted at Nameless King.However, if you desire to challenge the pinnacle standard of top-tier boss fights, seeking gratification and satisfaction, then this is a message from me to you my dear to-be unkindled, future linker of the first flame, devoter of Software of the FromBuy this game, if you would.For that is our curse",1
Positive,"This game is great fun. It is quite hard to get the hang of but once you do you will not regret doing so since this game offers a variety of fun and new things to do.P.S. Don't quit if you die, learn from your mistakes and continue on.",1
Positive,"Okay, full update to my review. Original review below. After some tinkering and tonkering, I figured out how to get my DS4 controller to work. This is what I did:1. exit Steam2. go into input mapper and check the exclusive mode (if already checked, just try unchecking and rechecking. Doubt it would do anything, but I did that).3. Close input mapper, and restart it. 4. log into Steam again.5. Start up Dark Souls 3Note that while doing that, I had my keyboard and mouse disabled to reduce the potential for error. Also, I started getting disconnected more frequently, and just switched to offline and no problems. It's fun to watch people's ghosts and all, but more fun to get uninterrupted play time. Until online connectivity is fixed, I'm just going to stay offline. So besides me fixing my problems, I am having a blast so far. It's my first Souls game (a little Bloodborne prior) and it's awesome. Combat is brutal and engaging, enemies are ruthless, but not frustratingly so. I might get killed super quick, but I always notice something I could fix to get past that enemy on the time after that. or after that. or after that. The world looks gorgeous so far, I am able to run it on high with my PC, with framerates that aren't terrible, and it is beautiful. The world is incredibly detailed, with little things that just pull your eye in, which is good, because you will need to be paying attention to find some of those little nooks and crannies that let you advance.So, I give it a reccomend as of now. Definitely some adjustments that need to be made, but nothing gamebreaking for me now.-Original Review-I will be giving a negative review until Dualshock 4 controllers are supported, then I will re-evaluate.I will say though, that this is running rather smoothly for me. I know some people are having issues with the bonfires causing crashing, but I don't seem to be having any of those problems. Also, the game is a blast, I just wish I could use my Dualshock 4. That would make it perfect.I should also note that I am frequently disconnected from the server when playing online. Luckily the game boots quickly from the home menu. This is likely just an issue that will exist in its early state, and quickly get fixed. Server trouble isn't uncommon upon release, but still an annoyance",1
Positive,Get gut or die trying,1
Positive,Pretty cute game. I managed to git gud.,1

Positive,Visions of greatest game,1
Positive,"The conclusion to the Souls series and my first souls game, this is a very beautiful and rich filled game jam-packed with such memorable moments and soundtrack that will ring in my ears through the night. Throughout all the struggles and the many deaths, I've always came back to defeat each boss with my hands sweating and heart pumping adrenaline that made me cheer for joy when the Soul of Cinder fell. I would honesty recommend to anyone looking to getting into the Souls series and will definitely work my way through the DLC.",1
Positive,"One of the best game of this year. good:1. V.V.Very super good level design. Good designed checkpoint make the game much more hopeful although the game is hard. 2. Boss are challenging, but possible to beat.3. The story are hidden in the discription of items, it gives spaces for players to imagine the whole story.bad:1. The region is very small in the late game.",1
Positive,"First of all, I'm going to start by saying that at the time of writing this and having finished the game, I haven't met the minimum requirements to play it. Nope, not even close. Ran it on my trusty old piece of junk 2009 desktop.Despite my average 20 FPS I still have enjoyed the game a lot. From does it again, everyone!I loved every single moment of it (excluding the crashes before the 1.03.1 patch came out, of course). The amazement of finding and exploring new areas (and being completely taken away by the pretty scenery), the excitement of boss fights (some of them REALLY badass, mind you), the tension of the combat, and of course the jolly cooperation, which I have indulged into very often (because pvp sucks).I'd say the only ""bad"" thing the game has is just the usual signs of From Software Quality Programming (the heck is with all these Scaleform threads using up an entire core?), but despite all that it's a great game, and I can say for sure it surpasses its predecessors.I definitely recommend it, that's for sure.",1
Positive,"This is a great game. It's not ""incredibly hard"" like people label it, it's ""challenging"", but it's always fair. The way it tells the story is not typical, and the gameplay is one of the most rewarding experiences I've ever been through. I totally recommend it, for Souls fans or people new to the franchise.",1
Positive,"I was looking for a rewarding challenge, I found it.I was looking for a deep, compelling story, I found it.I was looking for adventure and mystery, I found it.It has been years since I've seen a statue missing or an alcove empty and paused to ask myself, what is the game trying to tell me? Often I would have to make a note and research it later if I had missed a clue or detail - I was always shocked at the results I'd find. It is beyond rare that depth of story matches gameplay, but for that very reason you're still hearing about Dark Souls years after.Without a doubt, Dark Souls 3 is the pinacle of 8th generation hardware and I would say the perfect use of console hardware and controller. Shoulder buttons for standard attacks not only changed the way the 360 controller was designed, but opened up the possibilities of more than just shooting your way through a game with trigger presses. Defying every convention and forging it's own path with no preconceptions, it not only set new standards but has defined itself as it's own genre. We live in an age of sequels and rehashes, cash in after cash in, but Dark Souls is akin to art and 3, the final chapter, is merely the refinement of Demon Souls and Dark Souls combined - often literally. Characters not only return, but are further developed or honed by fire into something more.Like STALKER, I recommend starting with 3, then 1, with Bloodborne and 2 as optional based on taste.",1

Positive,"My favorite game in the Dark Souls series. It has some flaws just like its predecessors, but a better port for PC compared to DS2 and the original DS, and it's absolutely gorgeous. Camera is still your biggest enemy though. Lastly, it's quite interesting to see how many assets and concepts in this game have been reused in Elden Ring (Those minor erd tree boys are more or less a copy of the giant swamp A holes, except they are bigger douchebags).All in all an awesome game and series worth your time!",1

Positive,"One of the greatest video game experiences of my life, absolutely my favorite souls game. You get so incredibly immersed into this strange, dark world, you start reading lore and start investing your time into finding out it's secrets. The difficulty is perfect, if you can't take it it's not for you but this game wont twist and turn and change its original intentions to accommodate other players, it is what it is and it's proud of it",1
Positive,"First of all, I didn't have any perfomance issues with a pretty mediocre gaming rig (i5@4.3GHz, 8GB RAM, GTX 760). Only one crash in 60+ hours and stable 50 fps (limited to 50 via RivaTuner to fix screen tearing which was present at 60fps) save for a few fps drops to ~40fps in some areas of Lothric Castle and Cathedral of the Deep.As for the settings, I had SSAO, textures and reflections on max, and AA on. However, shadows, lighting, shaders and effects are on low. I don't really see any changes vs. high/max, but those settings decrease fps by about 10-15%. To me this feels like the best PC version of Dark Souls upon release (of course, SotFS had a better optimisation, but it was released more than a year after DS2).The game itself feels like a good mix of DS, DS2 and Bloodborne. Sometimes DS3 it's definitely harder than its predecessors (those lothric knights, damn): the enemies are faster, more aggressive and unpredictable. Think of heide knights from DS2: SotFS with ridiculous attack patterns. However, I started as deprived, so there's that. Killing the first boss with a club is a challenge. But that's if you are playing solo. Summon at least one phantom, and the game turns into a walk into a park.And that's the main problem with the difficulty: since enemies are generally fast and aggressive, it's pretty hard to deal with that pressure solo. However, enemies usually don't switch targets too often, so you (or a phantom) can put out a lot of damage while AI attacks another player character. This makes boss fights too easy, while some of them are pretty impossible solo.Another problem is the level design. DS3 doesn't have an inteconnected world like DS one does or a non-linear progression like DS2 does. Basically, every location in DS3 is a thing in itself, and while there are shortcuts and secrets, you don't really feel the consistency of the world. Anyway, the visuals are great and while some locations will feel familiar to DS fans, this isn't a bad thing.What is really bad is network synchronization and cheaters. The game has been out for more than a month (since JP release), but there are tons of network issues and a lot of hackers. FromSoftware is banning the latter (along with honest players), but there is little to no improvement for the network problems. Invaders and phantoms having no animations, phantoms not able to travers the fog wall and help with a boss fights, game disconnects and so on. And there's also a slight lag in almost all pvp battles so that it's harder to parry and near impossible to score a backstab.Bottom line: despite its flaws, DS3 is a great PvE game, but PvP part still needs a lot of improvement.",1
Positive,"Good game execpt there is a major problem.made a new character, about to face dancer, can't beat dancer by myself.and phantoms can't enter the room.I was playing with a phantom the first time i entered the room, then after that, they wernt abel to enter ^.^ kinda a problem ya know? and i'll be damned if I restart my game because of a broken glitch that forces you to solo. I tried exiting the game, tried resting at a bon fire, everything.BEWARE THE DANCER. that's all I will say. She is broken with that glitch.EDIT:Randomly fixed itself, beat the Dancer.BEWARE THE RANDOM GLICHES.One of my favorite games honestly, I was once a casual player. And then I played darksouls.",1

Positive,"I'm sure you've heard of the Dark Souls series, you've probably heard about the difficult yet rewarding learning curve and maybe even thought to yourself this game isn't for me. However, give it a try maybe even find some friends to play with you and maybe just maybe you'll fall in love with this game like I have. If the price is an issue wait for a sale they usually come around the holidays or during the summer. If you've never played a Dark Souls game I recommend buying the First game (Dark Souls) and just forget about the second game.Happy adventuring and make sure you praise the sun!",1
Positive,"since elden ring was my first soulsborne and it being one of my favorite games, i was told that i would probably enjoy dark souls 3 as well & they were so right! i absolutely loved this masterpiece from beginning to end. spending hours on a boss and to finally defeat it feels very rewarding and makes u want to play even more. 10/10!edit: one bad thing about this wonderful game is that the pvp is filled with cheaters. over the course of 2 days of grinding concord kepts for the achievements, i've ran into a total of 5 cheaters making themselves invulnerable, being able to revive themselves to full health, etc. so, if you're looking to play this game mainly for the pvp aspect, i would avoid it at all costs imo.",1

Positive,Probably my favorite game ever I think.,1
Positive,"ALthough the main story is short (can be beaten in under 30 with a lot of deaths), the game is all around one of my new favorites. It has the graphical style of both the first Dark Souls and Bloodborne, has combat pacing that is faster and more intense, had beautifully designed environments, has all the references you could every need, and will chizle you into the player you've always wanted to be. And best of all, it is fun as heck.With that said: buy the game and git gud",1

Positive,"It's like Dark Souls 1 and Bloodbourne had a baby, a really fucking ugly baby and neither of them wanted to keep it so they threw it out to fend for itself. It still managed to get all of the bad habits from them both like Bloodbourne's pvp (player versus pussy) where you can heal quickly so fights last longer than they should and Dark Soul 1's cheaters. What you're left with in the end is a game that thinks you should think it's fun because it's a ""Souls"" game, it's a game that most everyone talks about being artificially difficult. Althought I agree with that in some ways because most every enemy takes the cheesiest way in order to hit you everything still has a decipherable pattern you can work out, they just moves quicker so it's harder to understand it. That being said, it's still a better game that Dark Souls 2. Fuck Dark Souls 2.",1

Positive,Most polished Souls game. Pretty damn linear though. Lots of quality of life improvements. Combat flows nicer than any of the three. Dark Souls 2 PvP was better during its prime but this one is still really good for a Souls game. Co-Op pretty seamless. Overall probably my favorite of the three.,1
Positive,"People will complain about how hard this game is and I agree. It can be difficult at times. Yet it rarely feels unfair. If you die, it's because you know you messed up and the game isn't out to get you(even though some enemies can feel that way). Runs farely smoothly and I have rarely had any frame drops. Control scheme is a little different than most people are used to, but it's farely easy to get used. When it comes to difficulty, I really struggled at first. I couldn't seem to progress past the high wall of lothric, but after about 10 hours something finally clicked and I started understanding the mechanics and doing better overall. 10 hours may seem like a lot of time to spend just trying to figure out if this is something you want to invest your time in. I now have 71 hours into it and absolutely love the game. I would and have recommended this game to most gamers I know. Other things to mention. Enemy types are varied from location and all feel unique. Even if you can one shot a single enemy, if you aren't paying attention and they manage to land a hit, they can really mess up your day. The boss fights are where this game really shines. While it has the least amount of bosses across the entire soulsborne series, all of the bosses feel unique and fun to play. Another thing, you can just fly through the game if you so please, but the best experience comes from really exploring all of your surroundings. Their are so many items hidden away that really make your life easier. I think i've covered all the main points I would like to adress. I would defintely recommend this game to anyone and it's well worth putting time into. 10/10",1

Positive,"This review is for the based game ONLY, not including the DLC content etc! There is nothing really bad to say about the game. I will get this out of the way though. The levels are super linear and don t connect to other levels. Instead they have elevators and doors that connect to parts of a level you have already been in. These are just shortcuts that don t actually do anything else but save time. While it is really great that they added these I would have enjoyed the Dark Souls 1 approach of making the levels have branching paths. Coming from Elden Ring & with a lot of practice, Dark Souls 3 felt like one of the easiest souls games I've ever had in my 1st playthrough and leveling up seems pretty quick almost as quick as Elden RIng leveling imo. Not a negative nor a positive just things I want to point out. Otherwise I only have praise. The combat is solid, not as smooth as Elden Rings but still decently playable even in ""today's standards"" as a friend of mine once told me, way better than DS1 by 10x! Bosses fights in the game are all unique & fun to go up against, at least some of them. The ones that are bad are just mediocre. Dark Souls 3 s story is really sad and thought provoking but it doesn t overlap with the gameplay instead telling it through the bosses and the environments as you re playing the game. The lore can be uncovered by reading the item descriptions but I would recommend just watching a YouTube channel VaatiVidya for that. The music always fits the themes of the game and enhances them to a different level. The game s atmosphere is not anything special by the impossible standard Fromsoft has set for themselves but it is still recognizable and really immersive and not bad by any means. Dark Souls 3 is a near perfect game where there are no bad parts but only a few mediocre parts. There are no perfect games but this is absolutely one of those special ones that get so much right and some parts are so close to perfection I just absolutely can t give it anything else but a true 10/10.

Positive,"When Dark Souls was extremely popular, i was never interested in these types of games.To Hard, To much Grind, requires a lot of time to build up and progress and the lore was deeply complex.In todays day and age I welcome thee, and love it. Let the gaming industry fall down into the abyss, let it be devoured by undead developers and usurped by hollowed companies which lack humanity, and passion, for what was once a recognizeable and admirable form of art, that would link the imagination of many, and bring about new, genuine, captivating and sensational games.Let the whole world fall into Darkness so that one day tiny flames dance across the darkness like embers linked by lords past.",1

Positive,"Definitely get this game no matter what kind of a gamer you are, the reason is apart from the challenge there is fantastic world to explore. Kudos just for the creativity of the world design and rest of it.In just two years time they developed such a good game while developing bloodborne together . you can have near 100 hours worth of content if you do not rush.It has a fast pace design compared to the other 2 games in the series. also pretty interesting boss designs. There is so much to tell, but yeah one thing I feel that is a down is the PVP. even though its fun I can still see hackers around I guess the publisher doesnt mind all of these actions, cause they ban u more than the hacker or modder.I wish I could get more of dark souls but yeah the epic legacy seems to end here. Also for people even though Demon souls and bloodborne have the same theme and idea doesnt mean they are from the same series a lot of elements of those games are shared but doesnt mean they are connected. Weapons are present everywhere due to From software liking those weapons more than actually having a connected lore behind it",1
Positive,"Best souls series game, masterpiece",1
Positive,"LEGEDARY. I'd recommend beating every single boss, makes it a 'one of a kind' experience. Perfect amount of difficulty with a few frustrating areas/bosses but really satisfactory rewards. The ringed city DLC is absolutely incredible as well, the most challenging bosses are in the DLC and only a moron would neglect them. Interesting lore that adds on to the previous games in a fitting way. Overall a really solid experience, go for it! From Software is officially among my top studios.",1

Positive,"Once again From Software establish themselves as experts in crafting beautiful, twisted stories and worlds. The use of music, audio, fantastic character and level design, as well as ""show don't tell"" creates this wonderfully deep, depressing atmosphere, that pulls you in, till you alt+f4.Obviously this game is challenging, but it is fair (mostly). The first boss took me quite a while, rage quitting for months. But I came back. That's the beauty of the game. Sure you can get upgraded weapons and armour, but the most obvious progression is just getting better. You dodge those attacks, parry the strikes and learn the enemies patterns.There are a few irritating sections (poison swamp), but to dwell on them would be a disservice to the fantastic experience FromSoft has made. Don't give up, come back if you quit, get through it. You'll thank me10/10",1

Positive,"It would be honestly difficult for me to sum up how much I love this game, along with the entire Souls series, in one review.To keep it brief, this game has helped me through some of the worst times of my life. It offers a whole new outlook on a person's depression. This game, at it's core, is about persistence. To keep challenging these bosses and areas despite the fact that they'll smack you to the ground. If you persist, and learn, you'll accomplish great things.To give up in this game can be akin to ""hollowing"". Going hollow in the souls series is when the undead lose their purpose, give in to their condition. Sometimes going mad. It boils down to them losing themselves. That's what it's like to give in to the condition of depression. It can cause you to lose who you are at your core, and at it's worst you lose yourself in a far more grim way, without going into detail.Playing this game has honestly helped me get up some days. I don't want to hollow, do I? No, I want to keep going, keep getting up, and if it comes to it I'll keep getting smacked down. Getting back up is what counts in this game, and it's what counts if you suffer the same way I do.To conclude, game's great, lore's great, gameplay may be the best in the series and oh yeah it also gave me a different outlook of the world, and myself.Thanks Dark Souls.Edit:good game",1

Don't know why it took so long for me to finally get the game.Just one thing I want to rant about for a little bit is that there is no steam cloud or any other form of cloud saves and this is ridiculous for a game that came out in 2016. So if you lose your local saves then it's all over for you and this really is the last game you'd want to lose your progress on. The saves are stored in ""C:/Users/[your user name]/AppData/Roaming/DarkSoulsIII"" Go make backups! Other than that I still love this game and would always recommend it.",1

Positive,"Dark Souls 3 is the final game in the series and it adheres to the formular, if a bit too strictly.The Good:+Solid ARPG gameplay that is difficult but fair. Moreover you can use many different playstyles.+Great Atmosphere and music which really enhances the experience.+Improves upon the foundations of DS 1 and 2.+Great main experience with plenty of optional quests, areas, and bosses.The Bad:-Many issues still persist from previous games, which includes bugs, poor camera, etc.-Multiplayer is still unbalanced. The invader is still heavily favored even though they are risking the least.-Much of the optional content is obscure and might require the help of a wiki.-Many of the main areas are heavily inspired by the original Dark Souls.Bottom Line:Dark Souls 3 is, like the rest of the series, not for everyone. But, those who are willing to invest will find an extremely polished ARPG experience with many ups and downs. Personally, I'm not sure I would rate this above DS 1, but it is certainly far better than 2.",1

Positive,"DS3 was my introduction to the souls series and I gotta say I'm hooked. I'm not a huge fan of most RPGs as they focus more on stats and allocating skill points rather than core gameplay mechanics. Dark Souls 3 has none of these draw backs. Sure the game has level ups and stat boosts but they are only there to make sure you keep up with the games pace rather than grind just to attempt the next area. The game is not easy, as my intro to the souls series I got my ass handed to me more than a few times. You will end up cursing developers and throwing controllers (maybe thats just me) but I promise you its worth it. The combat in this game is simple yet satisfying, each attack on its own is very shallow but thats where the player gets to use their own creativity. The game constantly pushes you to develop your own engagement style whether its rush tactics or magic (if ur a pussy). But where the game really shines is in the enemies.The bosses of dark souls play as mean as they look. In most games you see these giant intimidating foes but when it actually comes to fighting them their attacks feel too obvious and broad. As if ur fighting someone in a bulky monster suit struggling to actually be the creature itself and attacking in slow predictable ways. Dark Souls 3 has no time for this pussy shit. The bosses move how they are meant to move they are agile have tight hitboxes and many attack patterns that react to your own choices in spacing and attacking. The amount of memorable moments are insane and will stick with you like no other game has and the satisfacion for winning is unmatched. Highly reccomended for all, definately give this game a try it has a great backbone with its fluid movement and combat, its not perfect there is some horseshit it this game that will annoy you but trust me when I say its all worth it in the end. Have Fun",1
Positive,"Challenging. Massive. Rewarding. This game doesn't hold your hand and treat you like a child. It kicks you in the crotch and reaches out a hand to pick you up, before kicking you again while you are down. But when you finally figure out how to stand up and take that Mf'er down. That reward is what this game is. 10/10 visuals, gameplay, story, replayability. Would recomment to anyone who even brought up the word dark or soul without even speaking about this game. Get it. Then GitGud",1
Positive,"This is my first game that I played in the soul series, and I gotta say, best game I ever played. If you haven't played the first games I advise you to search for information on YouTube since the storyline can be quite blurry for new players.The graphics, combat system, and story (once you understand it) are amazing, detailed and it is clear that From Software put a lot of good work into it.However, this game is not made for everyone, since you'll have to withstand getting killed over and over again until you're smashing your keyboard against a wall.

Positive,"Amazing game. Dark souls 1 was considered a flawed masterpiece, Dark Souls 2 was very polished but lacked the depth that DS1 had. I felt like Dark Souls 3 combined the best elements of 1 and 2 and created the quintessential dark souls experience.",1
Positive,"Having played Dark Souls, Dark Souls 2, and now Dark Souls 3, I can say without a doubt that this one is my favorite. While Dark Souls (the original) holds a special place in my heart for introducing me to the stunning and interesting world, this game gave me a sense of bittersweet finality. But, I guess I should try to review this in a more piece-by-piece fashion, as I could praise its general greatness all day.(There are going to be spoilers below for areas, but not bosses.)Graphics: ProThe graphics are fantastic in many areas, average in others, but never are they poorly done. Walking into Archdragon Peak, the Grand Archives, or Anor Londo gives a sense of not only the grand scale but also the accompanying attention to detail that these cames carry. Every segment of the game is finely crafted and immerses you in the action. This brings me to my next point.Combat: ProThe combat of Dark Souls 3 can either make or break your experience. At times it is fast paced, while in others it is methodical, however it never loses the trademark intensity of the series. This can frighten new players; many claim that this game is incredibly difficult. However, this is not necessarily the case. Becoming accustomed to the style of the combat and the mindset this game requires will reward one's dedication. The sense of pride and accomplishment one gains from defeating bosses, having died again and again to their titanic weapons or cataclysmic spells, is beyond anything I've experienced in other games. I swear I'm not a masochist.Story/Setting: Potential ConFor those who want a story told to them that has overtly complex and riveting plots, accompanying relateable characters whose motives and actions are deeply fleshed out, and gripping twists and turns that will keep you on the edge of your seat. this game is not for you. However, I have grown to love the lore bites that one can find throughout the world. Following the trail of a bumbling knight throughout the darkest nooks and crannies of the land is enjoyable, but it is just as easy to pass right over him and hardly notice his existence. The same goes for the deep history of the many factions who have affected the world's current, decrepit state. The story of this world is covered in ash; those who seek the truth must dig deep to find it.If you are looking for a story-driven game that appeals to your finer side, Dark Souls 3 is not for you. Overall, I'd recommend this game to any and all who enjoy high fantasy with intense combat and a stunning world.",1
Positive,"This is one of those games where only the stubborn or skilled will survive. You know you're going to die. A LOT. But you're determined to take it all the way to those end credits, because gosh darn it you said you would.",1

Positive,"Dark Souls 3 is a game I keep coming back to, and for good reason: I LOVE this game. Controls are nice and tight. Combat is extremely fluid and relatively easy to pick up. Multiplayer is a blast, especially with friends. Furthermore, the atmosphere, music, and (most) of the bosses are so good that it s a joy to come back to, especially when trying out new builds.I will give one piece of advice though: Dark Souls 3 (and Souls games in general, really) is all about patience, learning, and timing. If you re the kind of person who likes to run into the heat of things, you re gonna end up frustrated and tired out. The two most important things to have when entering an area is a level head and patience. You will still die. You may even be invaded and have your lunch money taken. Do not be discouraged. Souls games are all about the world shoving you, and you shoving back two times harder.Now get out there and do some shoving.",1
Positive,"The areas are really well made and labyrinth-like but area connections are just linear. Most areas (undead settlement, road of sacrifices, farron keep etc) have horizontal plane layout that do not have verticallity.

All new features like weapon arts adds unpredictablity in pvp. speaking of which ds3 has the easiest ""friend"" pvp access with a simple trick: passwords. long needed.

Positive,"Objectively the best game of 2016, the only issues i see occuring are some crashes but it depends on the person, so personally ive experienced like one or 2 in 300 hours, great story, addicting gameplay, fun and entertaining multiplayer, great coop, tons of content. liuke seriously one run of the game not 100% is like 40-70 hours, while speedrunning can durastically lower that time, it is only possible for experienced players, the main source of replayability comes from the different builds you can go through the game with, for example, my main has the most hours , however, i have a shrek build with a great club, a crusader build i beat the game with a friend who was also a crusader, a boss cosplay build cosplaying the dlc boss, and many more. the graphics, while lacking in some areas are beutiful, and the only noticable lacking comes from playing the game a shitton, meaning you probably wont notice it first time around, the music is incredible, each weopon feels varied and powerful, the armor sets are unique and form a large array of combinations, flaw wise it its lacking, the only major flaw i can sum up is the connectio n issues between players in pvp, which can lead to some iffy things. however this does not affect the game as a whole, and only affects those who play a lot of pvp, its level design is interesting and fun, and makes replaying the game that much easier, however compared to dark souls one it is not as immersive, and the main storyline doesnt hold as much impact, but compared to dark souls 2 its a masterpeice, as dark souls 2 was trash,with very few improvemnets, i am glad to say that ds3 keeps the improvements from ds2 and most of teh great mechanics from ds1, and has a lot of fanservice(in a good way) with reacurring weapons and armor sets as well as the continuation of some storylins from ds1, When i said objectivly that ds3 waas the best game of the year, i mean it, overwatch, for all its prowess, simply doesnt have the content or replayability at THIS point in time to beat ds3, im not saying in the future, but in 2016 dark souls 3 is better, overwatch has a host balancing and competitive issues that simply ruin my motivation to play it, but ds3 doesnt suffer from balance issues, some builds are op, but you rarely encounter them, infact, most builds are dependant on the player skill, not the weapon itself. making it fun and interesting, as well as rewarding.",1

Positive,"This is by far one of my favourite games of all time, and as such I feel like I should review it. I have spent over 500 hours in every nook and cranny of the game, exploring every weapon/shield/bow, all the wepaon arts, spells, miracles, pyromancies, everything you can imagine I've tried. I bought this game expecting to love it an llive up to the hype and it did for the most part, and I did cut it some slack considering how much people were expecting but this is my impression as it has molded and aged since I first started playing. I am a heavy pvp person, but I also like pve so this might be a bit biased in that sense. Also sorry for spelling errors, I wrote this at 3 in the morning. TLDR at the endI bought this game and immediately started playing. I became ""Ill"" So I could stay home and enjoy it. I loved every second of it. It was like playing dark souls 1 (My favorite game of all) With better graphics and new areas! My my first hour I was in love. I had already enjoyed seeing all the new enemies up to the second boss. The main things that stood out to me were that they blended the mechanics from dark souls one, two, and slighlty bloodborne, beautifully. I noticed the weapon arts and I loved them! They were amazing and each weapon had a unique weapon art (Mostly) and it was a whole new world to me. Then I opened my character sheet.I saw that the starting armor for the knight gave me very low poise. I thought that maybe because it was starting armor it wouldn't be very tanky. Nope. I equiped my lothric knight armor and gratshield (I farmed them) and saw I had pretty high poise, so I went to the starting enemies. Useless. Poise had no affect on me being staggered or not. I was extremely disapointed and I gave up my hopes of being a tank, and moved on to the next boss. By around after pontiff I noticed as I was leveling VIT and equipping heavier armor my damage intake was the same. I tested it and defense soft capped at aroound 30 (10 highger than the starting set). I eventually found Smough's set (Heaviest set in the game) And noticed that my defense was still soft capped. I equiped ring of steel protection, and I shad roughly 32 defense. This is what really upset me, they tried to make it like bloodborne in the sense that dodging was better than being tanky. The smallest weapons could stagger you, vastly reducing strength viability in PVE and PVP. I was furious. I've been strength since day 1, and I loved using heavy weapons. In dark souls 2 poise was nerfed but still viable, and defense was godly if you had the stats for heavy armor. I could destroy people with their tiny curved swords, and I looked forward to that in dark souls 3 but I was let down. They tried to make up for it with Hyper Armor (Not being staggered and taking reduced damage while attacking with heavy weapons) but it wasnt the same. They rewareded dex weapon spamming and to make it even worse they made shields unable to be punished! As long as you knew how to block it was very hard to be hit by an enemy or other player. They also morphed estus from ds1 and 2. They took the instant healing from ds1 and the ability to move while drinking from ds2 and made a monster. Without Llloyd's talismen, its near impossible to punish healing in pvp or pve. The plus side is that I was able to change my stats and upgrade a long sword. I also dislliked that Scaling was not as advertised in the equip screen. My heavy broadsword had an S scaling in strength (Highest scaling) and my club had a A, but the broadsword did more scaling damage! Meaning what they told me when I was upgrading my weapons was incorrect. This was just sloppy in my opinion. To top it off, by the end of the game I realized there was a lot of copy paste from dark souls 1. Personally I liked this since I loved DaS1 but some people might see it as fan service and unoriginal. All of this, and the fact that and the fact that the creators are catering to the more casual audience instead of the majority of returning fans just to make more sales make the game a lot less more enjoyable than what it could have beem. These are what turned me off the most, others might think they aren't that bad.I thought the enemies and bosses in Dark souls 3 were very unique, and I enjoyed fighting them. Some spammy enemies were a pain since tanking was nerfed (RIP Haveling) but I eventually got used to timing and dodging. They made pve either 1) Timed rolling and attacking, or 2) Turtling and attacking. This is the esssence of souls games but they took it to an extreme, since if you dont do either of these 2 tactics PVE is EXTREMELY difficult. Bosses were alll new, only a few re-used, and some had very intuitive mechanics that made the fight way more exciting (Abyss watchers, Nameless king, Wolnir, etc). The last boss gave me chills and was by far my favorite fight of all the souls games because of how it related to the player. It reminded me of all the characters I've made in the past, and how they all blended to form the soul you're fighting, and how the one who stoked the first flame, Gwyn, still had influence. There are a few things that made me dislike pvp very much in this game. Summoner covenants were ass. I rarely have ever been summoned by blue sentinals or watchdogs oro aldrich. The game rewards spamming dex weapons and cheap weapon combos. I see the same 3 or 4 weapon combos allmost every fight and the game rewards them The game rewards turtling (Hiding behind a shield) The game punishes intuitive builds and creates a cookie cutter meta that makes most other builld unviable N O F U C K I N G P O I S E Fromsoft has shown effort to fix these problems, but not in a definitive way. They make minor changes to expand the meta but nothing concrete has been done. Did I mention poise? This is the main reson shitty weapon combos and spamming is viable. Also defense soft caps. The game rewards ganking Invaders have 30% less health than the host, invade gankers 90% of the time, and can have their only advantage taken away from them by an item that you get for free at firelink Overall invading is shit, and the thrill of killing gank squads has been removed from the game pvp in general is very strict in the sense that if you dont duel with buffs and the same 3 types of weapons youre gonna almost constantly loseAll of this, plus the fact that this is the last souls game. Fromsoft has gone back to ruining metalcore instead of making better souls games (Maybe bloodborne 2 but thats all I can say) so this is what were stuck with unless we go back to a previous game. The pvp gets very old very quick and the community is not helping. Creative builds and tactics are defined by gankers cosplaying and using offhand crossbows. Unique builds are punished and some of the coolest mechanics in the game are shit on by darkmoon blade twinsords/straight sword, greatshield of glory, offhand crossbow, and ""git gud xDDD"". THe game has become a cancer magnet.I loved the fact that playing through the game to make pvp builds wasn't a chore, something dark souls 2 was. Fighting enemies is continuously rewarding, and takes a while to get old. I spent around 150 hours in it over 2 weeks and I still enjoyed playing it. The game has the replayability that dark souls 1 and demon souls had, and introduces hundreds of new enemies to fight. By the end of the game I was already looking forward to my next playthrough. The game also makes co-op very easy, and does not reward backstab/parry fishing which is a huge pro in my book.As a returning souls fan, you will enjoy the pve while the pvp is bad to mediocre at best. For a new player, the pve may seem difficullt but you'll grow into it and pvp will seem fine. 6/10.",1
Positive,"This game is probably one of the most solid entries in the Souls series. It doesn't make any major missteps, the level design is consistently good and aside from one lategame boss the bosses themselves are all serviceable.It's a game that doesn't do a whole lot wrong, but it doesn't do anything spectacularly either. Whereas Dark Souls 1 could be very up and down, it had lots of really memorable and amazing moments. DaS3 is kinda like DaS2 in that a lot of it's most important moments end up being kind of forgetable and this is especially the case with boss theme music. In fact the music has the exact same problem as 2 did; it all just blends together into a mush and you can't remember anything. But you can say the same for the bossfights in general; outside of one or two near the end of the game they're all just kind of. there. They're not bad or anything but they don't stand out either. This is kind of exemplified with the final boss fight; it's mechanically a really, really good fight (it's not fucking nashandra or allant basically). But there's none of the emotional build-up and impact of DaS1 or Bloodborne, despite the game trying it's best to copy aspects of the final fight in 1.EDIT: Since replaying the game fairly recently I'd reconsider some of the boss fight criticism. 3 in general has pretty strong bosses from a mechanical standpoint, arguably the strongest line-up in the series alongside Bloodborne. However the music is still substandard for most of them. I can remember the Abyss Watchers theme and that's about it; everything else is the same orchestral choir singing with far too many instruments going off at once and no discernable melody or hook to grab you.And that's really the only major flaw with this game. It's the 5th in a series, of which we've been getting 1 of each year for the past 3. I think there's immense replayability in the Souls formula, but at this point the Dark Souls setting is starting to get old. The reuse of so many different weapons, items, NPC's and enemies ends up hurting the game more than helping it. Not just in a sense of it being shallow pandering fanservice, but it actively hurts one of the main draws of the series: exploring and finding new things and new lore. I struggled throughout my playthrough to stay engaged for long periods of time because I was finding the same shit I'd always found, talking to same or very similar NPC's with no new twists and finding the exact same lore for the most part.DaS3 really suffers if you've played BB or are already really invested and familiar the series. The callbacks could either be really fun to you, or they could make your eyes roll and wish for something new. Thing is we already got something new. BB used aspects and cliches of the series, but so much of it felt fresh and it was in a genuinely new and interesting setting and it was released a year previously. It already kind of felt like From and the Souls series had moved on, or were at least attempting to try interesting spins on the formula. But DaS3 ends up feeling like a step backwards.That might not be a bad thing for you though and DaS3 is certainly not a bad game. I'm just very tired of the Dark Souls setting and didn't think any numbered sequels were ever neccessary. If you have less experience with the series, don't care as much and haven't played Bloodborne then this could easily be your fav of the series and you'll probably love a lot of things in it.",1

Positive,"This game saved my life.I am 33.My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand. my working hand. my games hand. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot. I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.Thank you",1

There's no fix or patch for it yet, and from what I've been reading it has affected a lot of people. I really want to play the game, because I like it quite a bit. But cmon!",1
Positive,"As a singleplayer it's okay, though not a good port. The story makes no sense, people will tell you it's cryptic and deep but in reality it's hogwash. But the story never gets in the way of the gameplay, and that's good. Co-Op seems broken, it's way too easy to play the game through with a friend. Bosses fall like nothing. The Co-Op function is also half-baked, it would be nice with some proper implementation of the mode, where you could play through the entire game with a buddy without him being a spirit, and while also getting a boost in difficulty.The community is horrible, if you want the ""full"" experience then you'll need to play online. That means opening yourself up to be invaded. There are two types of people you can get invaded by; Cheaters (rare), and low-life who do nothing but grind the same areas in the same level all night, with a min-maxed character build they read about online, ganking passing PvE players. In the beginning there used to be honor, people would duel 1-on-1. That doesn't happen anymore. It's a cesspit.When you aren't getting invaded, the game can be a lot of fun, if you're into this type of game. There's loads of mysteries and secrets. Feels old-school, complete with the clunky controls and everything. Get it on sale, and I'm sure you'll get plenty of hours of enjoyment out of it. Just know that this fun comes with a bunch of caveats.",1
Positive,"One of the only Dark Souls games I've played repeatedly because I enjoy it so much.

Positive,I love this game no words to describe it. The gameplay is awesome when you over come a challenge you are filled with joy and when a boss beats you you will litteraly be furious and give it another shot. The sceneries are absolutely stunning.

Positive,"Love every fiber of the Ds3. Other comments did say you would die 'over and over again', and honestly that was an understatement. However I enjoy reflecting on what I did wrong and proved to fix it in order to move on ahead. The game loves to show you the boss of the area from the start from afar, so when you actually reach there you can look back and be proud of what you've accomplished. If it's one thing I love most about this game. its the scenery. There's never an area that lacks detail. All the while fighting insanely hard enemies, you kind of accept the fact that you're in a gorgeous hell. You're welcome to go the ol strength sword build, but feel free to mix it up from time to time from the large variety of builds. Currently I'm enjoying the Miracle build, and never knew how many bosses were weak to lightning. I feel that it is unfair that weapons that balance the builds are all put into the dlc. However I don't own any dlcs. My encounter with them during invasions have crippled me. Whether it be lack of experience, or just incompetency.For instance the Ringed Knight Paired Greatswords. I'm not saying it's impossible to defeat a user, and I would suspect it would be easier to parry given dual wields always seem easier to parry (In my opinion), but the sword out put is insane, and the range is phenomenal. A few other dlc items I would say that breaks the game would be Demon scar, or Lightning Arrow. Although Lightning Arrow doesn't really break the game as much as the others, Miracle's down side are usually the slow cast time. With this miracle I feel that the quick casting can make others panic roll and you can catch them at the end of their endurance. And Demon Scar makes pyromancy more offensive. I find it best served with Black Serpent. You'll always get at least one hit in. Demon Scar is a way better counter part than Sacred Flame. All in all, though my review was more of a rant, I would highly recommend this game. I would probably give the base game 8/10. As a tip to serious buyers, the red glowing lines on the ground are community tips. Be wary, not all of them are as helpful as you would like.",1

Positive,"Darksouls is the best gaming series ever. While Darksouls 3 may not be the best entry in the series, it's still super fun! I would go as far as to say that its better than any non-souls game out there. After having experienced souls games and playing other games I often find myself wishing they were more like Darksouls. For someone new to the Darksouls series I think Darksouls 3 is the best place to start. (Especailly since Bloodborne isn't available on Steam). To put it in perspective I'll make a quick breakdown of each Souls game here:Darksouls 1 - Definitely dated mechanics, even with the remaster. Pvp is so easy to abuse and so poor quality that its not satisfying at all. What makes it worth playing is the interconnected world and the lore. The seamless and thoughtful way that the map is put together makes exploring very enjoyable and open in a way that makes you feel free. And being able to discover Lordran through item descriptions and NPCs still seems fresh after all these years. The following games didn't quite capture the lore in the way that this one did.Darksouls 2 - Funnily, kind of the opposite of Darksouls 1. The mechanics are probably the best in the series. The deliberate pacing and the way that your character controls allows for skill and talent to express themselves fully. This makes the pvp some of the best in the series, once you have achieved a level of competence. Unfortunately, the story and other pve elements suffer a lot. The map is probably the blandest in the series, going back to a hub design that feels somewhat like it's on rails. The enemies and most of the bosses are kind of bland and probably some of the easiest in the series, but the developers make up for it by shoving a ton of them together at once. Definitely quantity over quality. Its not all bad though, some of the bosses are genuinely enjoyable, you just have to sift through a lot of muck to find the gems. The DLCs are also worthy of note, and enjoyable.Bloodborne - All around solid game. The combat feels visceral, the world feels open, and the H.P. Lovecraft based lore is super cool. This is a great introductory game to the series as it reinforces good gameplay habits that carry through most of the other games. Darksouls 3 - This is kind of an amalgamation of the games that came before it. Its good enough, but gets a little hung up on nostalgia bating. The lore is on point but doesn't take any risks. The world seems larger than it is, which ends up being pretty good. New players might feel a little lost going through some of the maps because of their scope, but they will never flounder long because the next bonfire is always close by. Pvp is also pretty decent. There are a few issues with it that prevent it from being as good as Darksouls 2. For example the roll takes very little stamina, so it can make it easy to mindlessly avoid people instead of trying to engage efficiently. The mechanics in this game are a little on the forgiving side which makes pvp slightly less skill based. Initially I was disappointed because it controlled more like Bloodborne than like the previous Darksouls games, but over time the mechanics have grown on me. Altogether a very solid game.",1

Positive,"Miyazaki returns yet once again to bring us another souls game. Is it as good or better as the first Dark Souls or even Demon's Souls? no. Is it as good or better than Dark Souls 2? In ways, yes. Is it still an amazing game? yes. Buy it.",1
Positive,"Hey guys JACKS BACK AT IT AGAIN. TODAY were talking about the infamous BLOOD i mean Dark souls 3 yes Dark soul 3. In this Review you will get to see all the amazingly new additions to the game from bloodborne. SO lets start, Dark souls 3 is the next title to the Bloodborne triliogy ending up in the fact that this game is just a re skin from Bloodborne and not really dark souls 1 or 2 (shudders at the thought of 2) with this game you will get invaded by T posing invaders and we all know what that means, you can't react or do anything against them you might as well hit the alt + f4 button because your chances of beating them when they chug on ther SUNNY FUCKIN D is impossible son. Lets get away from the online though. the NPCS are even more ridicoulous as i walk into any area enemies have BULLSHIT strats that make oyu think. ""yeah lets go grab that jug of bleach and just drink up boys."" or the fact that there bloodborne aggro like makes it impossible for a game thats dark souls speed. All in all I guess you could say From soft really made a great port for bloodborne to pc and slapped a new name on it.",1
Positive,"Oh, where to begin.Before I start, I just want to say that I think this is the most well thought-out, well designed Dark Soul's game. The level design itself will throw you off so often that you feel as though you're almost always lost. A single path can split into three or four different paths. The only downside I have with this game is that some deaths can feel unfair because an enemy ""grabs"" you instantly kills you or breaks your guard and hits you over and over until you're dead without giving you a chance to do anything about it.There were plenty of moments where my heart was racing as if I had just been running away from the cops in a high speed chase going 150 MPH.9.5/10 because it's the same old Dark Souls we know and love but made better than 1 and 2.",1
Positive,"+Great level design+Much more polished gameplay in comparison with Dark Souls 2+No adaptability stat+No health loss after death+Improved graphics+Combat has become faster (no so fast as it was in Bloodborne though, but still)+Interesting bosses with challenging and unique mechanics+No soul memory+Epic music as always+Comfortable to play with Steam ControllerFortunately, I haven't been experiencing crashes or framerate drops (i5 760, R9 290, 16GB RAM), but some people claim the game is almost unplayable for them. I hope From will fix their problems as soon as possible. The game itself is definitely way ahead of Dark Souls 2 in terms of almost everything. Every controversial mechanic was fixed and improved. I can really recommend this game to every single Dark Souls fan out there! It's worth it.",1

Positive,"To casuals, this game might be considered difficult. However to me, this game was very difficult.",1
Positive,"The one and only way to describe the game!This is ten percent luck, twenty percent skillFifteen percent concentrated power of willFive percent pleasure, fifty percent painAnd a hundred percent reason to purchase the game!",1
Positive,"Great game, has entertaining PvE and PvP. Combat is the main selling point. High difficult with an extremely high expectancy to die often since the game is about learning the areas and adjusting. Enemies respawn when you die/rest to restore your potions (you get restorable HP/mana potions basically). You also lose all your souls (in-game currency) when you die although if you manage to make it back to where you die you can reclaim them all. If you die again before reclaiming your souls they're lost forever. Decent variety in what you can do PvP wise. You can invade other player's games using the red orb in which case you can get ember (increased hp and ability to summon other people into your game) as well as an item to unlock rewards from a covenant (NPC-based guild basically). You can also be summoned to protect people in their world against those invaders to earn a different reward for a different covenant. The remaining options in this type of PvP is to be the host (person who's being invaded) and fight or summon other players to protect you. The other type of PvP is a duel/fight club mode. You can summon/be summoned to duel somebody in your world or their world depending on who summoned who through an item you get that lets you place a summmoning sign on the ground. There are also 'fight clubs' that players make by summoning a bunch of people and letting them duel each other. This is most apparent in a later part in the game on a castle area that's fitting for dueling.Pros:PvP is very enjoyable and skill-based, although some balance issues with certain weapons, but overall a balanced game where you can upgrade most weapon and be viable in PvP. Spacing, maximizing i-frames during rolling, playing to your weapon's strength (animation speed, super armor, range, stunlock etc), and stamina management are the key parts of PvP.PvP has limits on who you can invade/help that takes into account how good your gear is and the game automatically scales down people who exceed the range. This only happens when you and a friend set a password to bypass the restriction as far as I know.PvE is surprisingly enjoyable as well coming from a person who loathes PvE in the majority of games. The knight type mobs are my personal favorite since they function somewhat like a player. There are also NPCs that can invade your game like normal players that function a lot like an actual player.Cons:Some weapons have questionable balance like the Estoc at least in lower tier PvP in the game. You basically spam thrust with it and can melt people.The way the game calculates damage makes mixed damage weapons pretty bad. Quality builds (STR/DEX) or builds that combine STR or DEX with another stat like INT or Faith are mainly king in PvP. This reduces the variety in build opportunities that hopefully will be patched to let elemental infusions be worth it.For PvPers, there is mild phantom range when fighting, but that is to be expected in this type of game since it'd be pretty miserable if you had to perfect connect with the enemy's model to do damage. Fights would drag on forever.PvP invasions can be frustrating for both sides when one side refuses to fight. If you're invading it's often 1v2 or even 1v3 meaning the host just turtles back while spawning an infinite amount of people to help them should somebody protecting them dies if you can't catch them while they're fighting a mob (invaders don't interact with npcs unless the host uses a special item that cancels that). Invaders can at least return home using an item, but if you're the one invaded it can be frustrating if the invader refuses to initiate vs you and turtles at the NPCs you need to advance. Invasions are only enjoyable when it becomes 2v2/3v3 or etc.*Minor con* Game could use more sets to spice up the customization since personally I only find about 3 sets visually appealing although there at least is a decently large selection to choose from. Comes down to preference and again is a minor con if not a con at all depending on your taste/preferences.*Minor con* Another minor con is it'd be nice if the game just had a straight up PvP arena you could queue for with matchmaking and such. Would make dueling easier and more consistent since one issue I have with dueling is that you have finite HP/FP (basically mana) and eventually have to rest or rejoin/die if in another world.Pro or Con:There's lore and such throughout the game, but it's not much of a hardcore story driven game like many other RPGs. Low amount of cutscenes with the game being more adventurous trying to figure out where to go and finding loot. This wasn't a con for me since I personally don't often play games for their story given I prefer PvP over anything.Armor doesn't mean much as long as you're at least wearing a piece in each slot. No significant difference in tankiness between armor. If you prefer more variety in builds this could be a con since there's no big enough difference for speed vs tankiness being an option as long as you weigh less than 70. This also however means you can wear whatever you think looks cool giving the game's customization more variety.Controller is highly recommended for this game. This is can be a con if you prefer kb+m. I prefer kb+m and adapted quickly to the game's controller and enjoy it a lot. You probably still could use kb+m, but I think you'd need to play around with the key binds first.",1
Positive,"FromSoftware has given us the wonderful gift of Dark Souls 3 and all of its, ""Your gunna die boy."" Joking aside, Dark Souls 3 has by far been the most enjoyable experiance I have played in a souls game. With its new face, new pace, and new weapon art sytsem, Dark souls 3 deviates from the norm, but at the same time staying close enough to home for experianced souls players. PREFORMANCE I have not experianced any form of crashing while playing this game, the framerate never changed and was smooth as butter. That being said, people are reporting about crashing and what not, I run a Nvidia GTX960, and I had no problems, make sure to cross refrence your configs with people who are crashing just to make sure you don't have the same problems. GAMEPLAYAll of the core elements of a souls game is here, for those who wanted more Dark Souls 1 in your Dark Souls 2, this is for you. In fact, to sum this game up, it's just one GIANT homage to Dark Souls 1. Everything to the attack animations to the walk and run cycle feel like they were ripped out from Dark souls 1, polished, then put into Dark Souls 3, I for one love it. Vertans of Dark Souls 2 can still easily get behind this game, just be warned about the new pacing, it might throw you off a bit, but with some practice you'll be able to easily pick it up. Veterans of BloodBorne, well you might be a little bit bored with the pacing, but don't fret! Dark Souls get its diffuculty from methodical enemies such as the knights in the game, and their GOD DAMN SHIELD BASHING, EVERY STUPID TIME. Seriously though, if your a fan of BloodBorne you might very well love the Dark Souls series, just keep in mind it's not as fast, that doesn't mean it will be easy though! The biggest feature of Dark Souls 3 combat has to be the new weapon arts, cool and flashy as hell, just what I like. They do change the game though, in both a PvE and PvP standpoint. PvE it gives a whole new range of tactics and combos. And in PvP, new abilites to kill people to, ranging from lunging attacks to heavy downward swings. I don't know about you but the stupid Ultra Greatsword upward strike gets me everytime, I don't know why, I just can't seem to dodge it. STORY I'm not spoiling anything, you'll just have to play the game. Dark Souls is very.subtle in its story telling. All I am going to say is take in the environment, talk to everyone you can, read item descriptions, everything has a reason, you might very well be surprised what you find.CONCLUSION Dark Souls is not for everyone, it will put you down, and keep you down, the only way you are going to see those end credits is if you grit your teeth and push through the storm of hurt that is Dark Souls 3. By far GOTY right here. RATING 10/10",1
Positive,"despite name, very large lack of souls that would be considered dark. like 8/10 lol",1
Positive,holy shit that's a masterpiece,1
Positive,"As a fan of Dark Souls, I can say that this is definately my favorite of the series. It has the quality in story and atmosphere of the first game, better visuals than the second game, and the more fast paced play of BloodBorne. Essentially Dark Souls 3 takes all of the good and none of the bad from the last games in the series.Boss fights are incredible, and some of my favorite fights of the entire series are from this game.It took me around 38 hours to finish my first playthrough, and I'm sure I missed some stuff along the way. The long and short of it: this game is absolutely worth it at full price. It's been a long time since I've said that about any game, but this one can't be missed.If you need me, I'll be here on my second playthrough. PRAISE THE SUN! \[T]/(Also, my rig specs are: GTX 970 4GB, 16GB RAM, i7 4790k overclocked 4.4Ghz. I had solid 60 fps all the time on ultra settings aside from a few hiccups when loading)",1
Positive,"I give a cautious recommendation - this is a decent, if highly frustrating, action game without a particularly strong personality, and you won't miss anything if you skip it.Upon completing Dark Souls III, I'm struck with a peculiar feeling of emptiness. There are startling vistas to gaze upon, true, and many, many things to do, but in the end it feels like a collection of left-over parts - though fine parts they may individually be - from other games. And while it is a more cogent and polished production than the potluck that is DS2, it still lacks any of the original entry's burning soul. I believe DS3's various dullnesses, as well as its jarringly fast gameplay, are merely products of a blind and halfhearted groping after fan expectations of difficulty and obtuseness. What business do ultra-comboing humanoid bosses la Devil May Cry have in a game with player-character movement this sluggish? They don't have any, and thus it all feels terribly off. If that level of speed is what you want, play Sekiro - which is a far better game than this one.",1

Positive,"Dark Souls III is one of those games that will put your patience to the test. It will make you angry sometimes but once you've accomplished something in the game it is the greatest feeling ever. I was much more intrigued from this game than Dark Souls 2 because I thought the combat was much more responsive and not clunky. The bosses were damn amazing and some were super challenging. They added weapon arts for the weapons and I thought that was a huge plus in my book. Also, it is much more easier to find players to co-op with. PvP is better than DS2 although sometimes you will match with people with their unbearable lag but I gotten used to it.There is also many weapons you can play with and many builds to experiment with. I've beaten this game about 5 times and still go back to it just to help people fight certain bosses. If you're looking for a game that will kill time then this is the perfect game for you. You won't be disappointed. 9.8/10 Great game!",1

I suppose thats the trade off for the graphical improvments, not one i'd make myself but I am not the king of FromSoftware. It's essentially more DS with a new magic system and a return to the feel of the first game, with the exception of a few random easter eggs, acts as though DS2 never happened. Still a brilliant game with enough meat on it to still be considered a big game, It is dwarfed by the first two though in square footage.https://steamcommunity.com/groups/Priority-One",1

Positive,"pretty cool, not as dark as i anticipated",1
Positive,"Well, it's here and it's a welcome return to form from From (try saying that when you've had a few drinks). At the core this game seems to have recaptured the old magic of the first Dark Souls, without resorting to just being a reskinned clone with a new map.The gameplay is fundamentally similar to the other two entries, albeit with some notable differences. All weapons now have ""skills"", some of which are shared between similar weapon types but usually confer new, devastating movesets or temporary bonuses such as increased poise or slow HP regen. These all consume a new stat, FP (focus points) which is shared with spellcasting. This new dynamic does improve the variety of gameplay vastly, although I feel magic has been somewhat left out of this, not getting the same bang for your FP buck, but maybe I'm not far enough in yet. Combat is also faster paced and more fluid, meaning you have to be even more careful than before about making yourself vulnerable.From a technical standpoint I think From have overall done a commendable job on making a PC version of this game, albeit with a few post launch bugs I've heard of along with minor networking issues but I've yet to find anything game breaking or even just more frustrating than the game itself. Graphically speaking it's pretty but I have noticed a few frame drops on my mid/high range system so I can't speak for those playing with older hardware. I have to give particular praise to something I haven't seen mentioned much, native integration of the Steam Controller. From have done a marvellous job in creating a smooth and comfortable control scheme taking full advantage of what the controller has to offer (having said that, given the way camera input works on it, I imagine KBM users have far from been left in the dark here, especially with regards to the way previous games handled targetting).Overall I think From have managed to recoup the atmosphere and tension (and indeed teeth grinding frustration) the original Dark Souls offers. This is truly the successor to the series I wanted, and while I would like to see more games in the future, this would be a worthy send off for a truly unique game series and I would have no regrets.",1

Fun bosses.The story is meh. And the new schtick with mutually exclusive NPC quest lines, as well as requirement for NG+ and NG++ to collect all the item variations, is only there to extend the play time without adding any actual content. Also, the main character's lighting is weird; the face looks ugly no matter what you do, and it's especially bad if you stand near any NPC, it's as if it's covered in crude oil or something. Also, the clothing is weirdly thick and cartoonish looking, there's barely any normal looking armor pieces that look good for some reason, so it's the weakest entry for Souls Fashion aficionados.The music is also very forgettable to me.

Positive,"Great game, pretty challenging and rewarding, fun with friends, and a stunning duo of DLC's100% recommend it to people who can deal with dying over and over, especially on the DLC, not saying the Base game is easy, but the DLC areas are hard, same with the bosses.ngl i really like this game even though i spent an hour on the first bossthe NG+(x amount) cycles make the game even harder, and currently i'm on NG++ and it's pretty hard, after ng+7 bosses stop gaining health and damage, but normal enemies do still gain more health and damage (i think)the lore of the game, while hard to piece together, is amazing, and well the music is awesome, the game plays perfectly and runs smoothly.",1
Positive,"For my first souls-type game, it was a very fun and enticing video game experience that I have not experienced in a single-player format. Very few times have I not been fully immersed into a boss fight. The soundtracks completed the atmosphere and was full of epic tracks that I will remember. The story progression of the game was simple: kill bosses and become ultimate chad. The side quests are fairly varied for being a non-open world like the Grand Theft Auto franchise. The Ringed City DLC with the Spears of the Church bossfight was innovative and I very much liked that aspect. The only thing I didn't like about the game was how small the Ashes of Ariandel DLC and how small it is. Both the Ringed City and Ariandel DLC cost the same price, but it feels like Ringed City had a more generous amount of content (Also shoutout to LilSippyCupX for allowing me to get the ""All Pyromancies"" achievement dude)",1
Positive,"I almost missed out on a great game because of all the fame it's got (game being extremely difficult, etc) and me being a somewhat casual gamer. Turns out it's a nice challenge, and the difficulty makes sense with everything happening in the story. There's lots of exploration which I really enjoy, the music/atmosphere is glorious, the scenery is beyond beautiful, and defeating the bosses feels amazing. I know I still have a long way to go, but I'll keep getting better. Praise the Sun!",1
Positive,"Not a lot of games keep my attention and I've never been one for a challenge but this game manages to keep me coming back for more. It's challenging but fair, frustrating but fun and while I don't care for the dialogue and don't really feel an attachment to any of the characters, I do get a sense of satisfaction after I beat a boss.",1

It has amazing lore that is depressing and melancholic, but it doesn't out right say it in the first place; you see, to find the snippits of lore you'll have to look in items, so collecting is a must. Or yunno you can watch the many lore Youtube channels out there. The gameplay is a huge improvement over past games, while DSR was very tight and felt good( and in my opinion was amazing in it's own right) DS2 was very jankie and clunky, this game is as smooth as butter: taking knowledge from Bloodborne to improve this title was a great choice.

Positive,"A love letter to fans of the series.Edit: I just want to add that, despite really liking this game, loving it even, it is FULL OF GLITCHES. Most of them have ben around since the release and Fromsoft doesn't seem to care. They should be ashamed.",1
Positive,"This game is extremely fun, it starts off quite difficult, but the more you go on the bosses get more interesting and difficult and you begin to learn how to do them so much better and more consistently. The multiplayer is decent as well, and the replay ability is massive, being able to play the game as a strong heavy weapon character or a mage you can do a lot. The DLC is extremely fun, the bosses are probably more difficult than some of the main game bossesNG+ is also quite fun, it gets more difficult as you make more and more NG+ saves.Seriously recommend getting this game when it goes on a sale seeing as it is $100.",1
Positive,"I'm a DS2 fanboy, yes unpopular opinion but I love DS2 the most, come get it what's up? But, I honestly have to say that DS3 is the ultimate souls experience to date, in my opinion it beats Bloodborne and Sekiro as well, even though I LOVED the artwork and the atmosphere in Bloodborne (who doesn't? lol), but I really think DS3 beats them all, it's just a complete souls game and you can play it however you like, dual-wield, shield builds, tank builds etc etc. The graphics are great, however I did notice weird frame drops here and there and I do have a beefier machine, it's nothing that would bother you when playing but I have to say I did notice that this is not the greatest console port. DS2 and Dark souls remastered run at 60 fps and absolutely never drop bellow 60, DS3 however tends to go to Bloodborne PS4 30 fps lock level performance in some areas, for whatever strange reason. The story and the lore are up to you to discover and this is something I always loved about Dark Souls games, I'm old-school, I'm a DOOM and Quake player, I don't have time for long Witcher 3-esque cutscenes and dialogues, I just want to be thrown into the game and action and have fun, I'm not watching a movie, I'm playing a game and DS3 delivers exactly this as previous titles did. The combat has been vastly improved over the previous games, it's snappy, it's improved and it's fast! I really have to say that I enjoy it tremendously, it has that weight and slashing foes is so fun here. Keep in mind that it is faster than previous games and will kick your a$$ if you don't pay attention. Bosses also come in 'phases' and this adds another layer to the combat, although I'm not a fan of 'phases' in bosses I don't mind it that much. Anyways, I really wrote too much, just get the game, you won't be disappointed, it's a masterpiece and FROM software is definitely my favorite developer, their games crush all competition, their games are the best, no doubt.",1

Positive,"A nice sendoff to a series that had started to show repetitiveness; while it borrows more than it probably should from its previous entries as well as its mechanical spinoff Bloodborne, the game still packs enough challenge, compelling boss fights, amazing environments and tidbits of lore that any fan of the series must play it.The difficulty is a heavily discussed aspect of these games that receives more attention than it should for the wrong reasons. There is no slider; instead, the game lets you build your own difficulty through your choices in starting class, weapons, armor, items and spells. Additionally you can summon other players or NPCs to aid (or hinder) you, which again lets you take control of the difficulty.That being said, Dark Souls III does feature several small improvements in many aspects that streamline the core experience while changing others that may not resonate well with experienced players; this includes weapon arts (skills), armor no longer requiring reinforcement, less restrictive covenant allegiance, more multiplayer items and covenant interactions, among others.In regards to DLC, if possible try to buy both for the full narrative experience as they play into each other but otherwise The Ringed City is the better value proposition, with more expansive areas, intriguing boss fights and a more satisfying finale for the series as a whole. Ashes of Ariandel is not bad but is definitely lacking in content, with the PvP matchmaking the only remarkable feature it has to offer.New players can start with this title but playing at least the original game first since the world, like its combat, does not hold your hand while you try to understand its lore and characters. Wait for a nice discount on the DLC or the complete edition for the full experience; otherwise stick to the base game and the 2nd DLC.",1

Positive,"Minor spoilers I guess.It's great but I have some issues with it.I found the game to be a little too easy/short honestly. I clocked in finishing the game somewhere around 27 hours (and hell there was at least an hour or so of idle time leaving the game up in there), and BELIEVE ME, I do not shy away from exploring/taking my time nor did I summon a single person to help me with the bosses in the entire playthrough. It's hard to tell if this is because I'm just so used to playing these games by now, or if the game was lacking in some way that is not completely obvious to me. It just felt like I really breezed through it in a semi unsatisfying way. There were several bosses that didn't even manage to kill me a single time, and several more that took only one extra attempt. Also the fanservice references to Dark Souls 1 were a little heavy handed at times. Yes, Dark Souls 1 is good, I love that game, but please make me fall in love again instead of having all these callbacks and references to a game I already played. When you're picking up weapons and armor from characters in the first game, seeing actual characters from the first game, and revisiting areas that we've seen before you aren't really being creative at that point and are instead attempting to carry the game with cheaply implemented nostalgia bombs.Other than that it's extremely good and does not waver from the standard of quality that has come to be expected from these games. The gameplay, controls, and graphical presentation are as good as you would expect if you've played any of the others. I'll admit I was a bit less than hyped for this game since it felt like they were beginning to milk the series due to its remarkable popularity, but it did manage to surprise and delight me despite my cynicism. But please for the love of god slow down on the releases (I'm considering Scholar of the First Sin and BloodBorne as well when I say this). Give me time to miss the Souls series so I can actually be pumped for a new entry. There's no need to go on a Call of Duty release schedule for these games. Quality over qunatity all the way.

Positive,"In my opinion: Out of the 3 Dark Souls games, this one is the best, shortly followed by Dark Souls 1 for its nostalgia and for introducing me to the entire genre/series.Dark Souls 3 is simply amazing and everybody and their grandparents should atleast give it a try.If you dont like it, fair enough, but atleast give it a go!From the amount of weapons and different playstyles, over the beautiful scenery and into the lore connecting the entire Souls-universe; This game offers you everything you could ask for. Well almost everything.Just like the other Soulsgames this one has its downsides, some weaponclasses are stronger than others (in pvp anyways). But that doesnt mean that not all are viable.Some bosses are very. inconsistent with their moves.And it had some initial bugs. However all of this shouldnt matter for the first playthrough!The bugs are gone, pvp isnt something I would do in my first playthrough and I wouldnt know what bosses do when facing them first time as well. so yea, go grab yourself a copy and start playing! ;D",1
Positive,"For anyone whose already familiar with the Souls series and genuinely enjoyed the first two games, this is just more of those. It's incredibly fun, theres still a fairly large playerbase ready to help (or murder) you, and it's really just such a great game. I do appreciate this one a lot more than DS2 simply because the classic strategy of hiding behind a shield an attacking once the enemy stops isn't really an option anymore, they've evolved most of the foes so that now their attacks are more than just 1 or 2 hits or there will be more than one way to get damage done past your shielding. With that being said, if you're brand new to the series, this isn't a bad place to start from, the game certainly carries with it all the familiar tones of the previous games and you're honestly not missing out playing them in any particular order.",1

Positive,"Alright here's an actual review. I was gifted this game by my great friend Alex (luky on my friends list, go give him bjs for his good work). Honestly, I would have never bought this game. I woulda bought Rise of the Tomb Raider instead and never would have experienced this masterpiece. This is the first Dark Souls game I have ever finished, as I couldn't even run DS1 on my old laptop and I kinda forgot I had it :P Anyway, there are lots of neat secrets in the game, the controls are amazing, the graphics are amazing, but not so amazing that they'll fry your $200 GPU (60fps on max with a GTX 960), and the bosses provide a great challenge. Honestly, you could just run through most of the levels and go straight for the bosses, but I wouldn't recommend it on a NG run. Once you get to NG+, the game gets alot easier. I was able to beat NG+6 pretty easily, and I'm trash at Dark Souls. Is this the easiest Dark Souls game? Maybe, I've never played DS2. Of the two I have played (1 and 3) yes, this is the easiest. It does, however, have some really, REALLY fun bosses, while DS1 made me suicidal with Ornstein and Smough. Overall, I would whole heartedly reccomend this game to everyone (except Tom. FUCK YOU TOM.)",1
Positive,"boss Translation This is the best game I have played in recent years (maybe I don't play a lot of games), to tell the truth, I started playing this game is pirated, but still bought a genuine, not only the content of the game to bring me happiness, more is a long time can not calm the mood. Whether it is in the early stage to make the novice feel desperate, or the content of the plot, after customs clearance is not the same feeling of achievement and happiness, perhaps the game is more suitable for me such a challenging heart and adventurous age. In this game, if you are a novice, you can rely on simple strokes to solve the battle, sometimes it can be difficult, but the fighting mechanism is not complicated; Conversely, if you are an old player, you can even use the complex fighting way to easily get the boss's residual fire, so overall, the game is very high. After playing, the kind of mood that want to share with others is a long time can not forget, good games are always memorable, but also left to the players a lot of thinking very imaginative space.",1

Positive,"Servers are back now, so. thanks? I guess? Only took seven months.Not gonna go all out on some multi-paragraph review. The game's ok. Not the masterpiece it's made out to be. About 65% of the time I played the main game I wanted to kill myself because of how annoying it is. Still kind of fun overall, somehow. Its main redeeming factor for me is its PvP, which accounts for more than 3/4ths of my playtime by now.6/10 decent fun if you think ""haha funny rolling knight game"" and don't buy into the ""this is the pinnacle of gaming"" bullshit.",1
Positive,"Ah Dark Souls. And with that I mean every Dark Souls or even Souls game. You either love it or you hate it. I think I just love to hate it! Just to quote the entire internet; ""these game are rock hard but never unfair"". As soon as you understand a particular enemy and learn its move set, you will be able to dodge its moves and block its attacks. Swinging in your own attacks and kill it bit by bit, while avoiding his or hers. Patience is key my friend. If the last three sentences don't sound like something you'd enjoy, then by all means do not buy this game. Because this is the Dark Souls experienceDamn that sounds awful, so what makes the game appealing Druss, my man? Well it feels fantastic if you finally beat a section of the game and finally find your next bonfire. It gives you the feeling you really really fought for it. That one f*cking boss that has killed you now for 30 times and you just cant figure it out? Willing to give up, because you have a social life right? (we all know we don't, who are we fooling?) Well wait till you DO figure it out and send it back to the dark pits of hell, you feel like a frikkin boss! And that for me is a good Souls game.Dark Souls III, is a solid last entry to the series I think, although I still have to buy and play Dark Souls II. The game world is chock full of lore that is totally left open for your own interpretation, the only thing certain is that you have to fight your way through hordes of enemies out to kill you without remorse. Your main goal: rekindle the fire and a new era of light? .or do you? 10/10 would go to this misery again!Replay value? -Hell yes, it has:- 3 different (plus one well hidden) endings. - 6 optional bosses and areas. - 10 classes with totally different play styles. - Tons and Tons of different weapons and armors to totally reformat your gameplay (no exaggeration).

Positive,"Aight, as a long-time player of the souls series, I'm going to try my best to give an unbiased review of this game (funny, no?) in an attempt to give an actual look at the game for anyone wanting to purchase the game.PROS:= texture quality: there are only a few graphical mishaps in the game, even on the lowest settings, and the textures that exist are high quality= armor physics: all of the physics related to the equipable armor sets are insanely detailed and quite accurate to real-life= music: the music for every boss is unique and powerful, setting the stage for what you will fight. This has been a high point for the entire series= responsiveness: the controls are incredibly responsive and the motions are fluid, something that the first few games did not have= PvE: of all the games in the series, the pve in this one is most likely the best. The enemies are appropriately scaled to the reccomended level per area and they are only difficult if you are not prepared. There weren't as many hidden traps for me, but that might be because I am used to the series by now= lore: a staple of the series, it is just as cryptic and confusing as ever, and the final dlc held info that was a long time coming= wow effect: almost every area you will enter is diverse and strange, making you wonder what you will uncover and what you will face= endings: as the end to the series, this game delivers in a subtle way. The series started in an obscure way, and that is the way it ends, not with a boom but with a whimper.= casting system: in past games, if you wanted more casts of a spell, you had to aquire it again and again, but this game allows for casting whatever spell you want due to a shared magic pool, allowing you to diversify.= emphasis on a health stat: in previoius games, the health stat wasn't too important as you would get small bonuses to your health as you leveled up. In this game, you will get no bonuses, making the stat that much more important.= easy optimizing: to make a build as good as it can get, you only have to meet certain caps, usually around 40. You can always go further, but at this level, you aren't investing too much, making the meta level of 120 very doable.CONS:= PvP: this one needs to be broken up into a few subsections - latency: probably the most annoying aspect of this game is the terrible connections between players. If one of you has a bad connection, you both have terrible hit recognition, and this can cause a whole list of problems - one-shot combos galore: half of the people in PvP are running builds designed to stun-lock you into submission, no matter how heavy your armor is or what buffs you have (poise, anyone?) - build variety: this was far worse at the beginning of the game's life, but even with all of the boosts to non-physical weapons, a quality build will still win out over any other build. Luck build? A moss will render it useless. Mage? Have fun with terrible split-damage weapons. Dexterity build? Looks like you are limited to 4 or 5 actually viable weapons. The past games had metas, but at least most weapons were viable against the meta. - invasions: I've always liked invasions, either as a host or an invader, but this game allows for estus use for both invaders and summons, which most of the time makes it incredibly unfair for any invader. This coupled with near instant summons makes it difficult to successfuly kill the host.= layout: as the series progressed, the world design got incredibly linear, making the game seem less interconnected and less maze-like. Some may see this as a bonus, but it makes the game feel more like a level-based game.= reused material: again, some may see this as nit-picking, but when a large portion of the armors and weapons in the game are reused from the first game, it becomes less nostalgic and more of a ""an old armor again?"" moment. They have become more defined and of greater visual quality, but the diversity died a bit.= stamina consumption: rolls take way too little, weapons take about enough, spells take way too much.In conclusion, I still really enjoy this game and the series in general, and I believe everyone should give it a try at least once. It's difficult, but not in a way that is unfair. But if you are a die-hard fan of the older games, this one may not be your cup of tea. It may not be as hard, but it still has it's charm. At the time of this review, I've played about 250 hours and I plan to play more, and I still recommend this game, but there are a few things that urk me that should be mentioned but aren't due to either a chorus of ""git gud"" or hype overload.",1

Positive,So this game i may only have about 7 hours on it but this is so far the best souls game imo the boss and even the minions are hard to beat lol i hadnt had a single crash either i do get small lag spikes and fps spikes once anda while but its not a bother :D,1
Positive,This is definitely the easiest Dark Souls so far. 80% of the weapons arent viable since they cant get infused or buffed. Literally every DS2 mechanic got removed.Great game for new Players. Hope From balances the game out soon,1
Positive,"the game was quite untense until I met Nameless king.Upd (01.05.2023): With this masterpiece I realized that everything is possible. Bosses in dark souls is analogy of climping up in real life. You can reach anytihing. If you're not prepared right now, pay attention to a theory quastion of a topic, don't drop your goal. If your hands fell just come back to it after rest.",1

Positive,"In my personal opinion. the first game is the best ""Dark Souls"" of the series. This one is the better ""game"".I was not too fond of it though. Way too easy compared to the others. The Nameless King's difficulty is overrated.There are elements that I do like. The NPC quests are better than the previous two games, excluding (again in my personal opinion) Lucatiel of Mirrah from DS2. The references to the previous titles are well done. if you can spot them.And then came The Ringed City. and I got sliced, burned, shot with hundreds of arrows, killed by poison. (long list inserted here). and got eaten/torn/burned/stomped by Midir.I love this game!",1

Positive,"Besides the dangerous hackers, this game still has solid gameplay mechanics and a good experience. I only played Dark Souls II previously and I can tell you, this game feels like a massive improvement and can get quite addicting. As low as my hours are as of this review, they have all come from playing most of the day away, in just a few days. If you don't want to risk the hackers, set game mode to offline, but I would also encourage using online because the experience isn't something you find in most games. I had been wanting to pick this game up for the last month and I'm glad I was finally able to get it. I was lucky to get it on sale price, but I'd be lying if I said that the game wasn't worth $60.",1

I definitely recommend this game.",1
Positive,I got this game on sale for 15 bucks and let me say im very impressed. The game is extremely hard and extremely rewarding and you really feel a sense of relief when you kill that boss that has been whooping your ass for the past hour. the scenery is another one of this games greatest pro's. its beautiful for being a dark fantasy setting. The enemies are also extremely creepy and cool looking. Theres so much to this game and i cant wait to play more and beat some of the harder bosses. definetly one of my favorite games on my steam library. ten outa ten,1
Positive,"As a person who is kind of timid, I disliked Dark Souls 3, because the atmosphere of the game just makes me nervous. But as I kept playing this game, the nervousness was still there, but something came along with it - excitement. It is alwasy very exciting when you anticipate unknown enemies or invaders ahead, and the sense of achievement aftering clearing an area/obtaining certain weapon is just tremendous. I played the game mainly with a friend and those were some of my happiest moments when it comes to gaming. This game might be a little bit overwhelming for people who have zero experience with the Souls series, but once you immersed yourself within this world, it will just be harder and harder to pull yourself out *( )*Highly recommended. If you are timid like me, ask a friend to play together, I am sure that will also be some precious moments for you guys. :)",1

The game runs extremely well with the 4790K and 980 TI as i would expect and i have so far had no issues other than being randomly tabbed out of the game. Overall, I would recommend this game to anyone whether they have played a DS game or not as it's definitely an entertaining game.",1
Positive,The best game available. Could not recommend any higher. Buy it now.*Known side effects include broken computer equipment and losing your life ingame and out*,1
Positive,"From what i have played it seems pretty good , im sure after i get past Iudex Gundy it is gonna get much better!",1
Positive,"This game is the way to go for someone who is new to the franchise, the combat is dynamic, the lore and music are just as amazing as in the previous installments and the gameplay is more fluid than ever. The game does however sacrifice replayability on the altar of open areas sadly which makes the world feel real on one end but makes avoiding enemies a better strategy than fighting them, this makes consecutive playthroughs consist of nothing more than running from A to B and taking out the boss. A boss which is likely an absolute pushover, Dark Souls games usually get a lot easier the more you play with them but out of the whole franchise, this was the first game where even after finishing it for the first time I felt like it was not hard enough. Most bosses are gimicky, some are too clunky, very few of them put up a good fight. Luckily the Ringed City DLC comes in to save the day, 3 of the 4 bosses are the best bosses in the whole game, the areas are not jokes either. The DLC is the ""end game"" area the base game was missing, but unfortunately you must play through the entire rest of the game every time you want to beat it because for whatever reason the developers decided to remove the item which was added in DS2 which could reset areas. The PvP is quite all right for the most part, co-op is very much fun too.Overall, the game is a good first-time experience but lacks the gameplay quality of the first two games or Bloodborne, making it less interesting long-term. But thats coming from someone with over 800 hours in the game so you know it aint all that bad.9/10 with DLC, 7/10 otherwise",1

Positive,"Back after 200hrs + in game.So Let me begin my review now :-{Graphics}- You will probably die by falling a couple of times looking at the gorgeous view Good Decent Bad Don t look too long at it- Looking at the graphics you will be out of out of words. From the start till the end the detailing done to the places and characters is truly master class. Specially for a game which was released back in 2016.-{Game play}- Very good ( Well its ds series ) Good It s just game-play Meh Watch paint dry instead Just don't{It works pretty good, and the creatures make the game interesting}-{Audio}- Out of this world Very good Good Not too bad Bad I'm now deaf- There are some places where the audio will give you jump scares. XD-{Audience}-This game is not recommended for casuals. It will make you rage and cry. -{PC Requirements}- Check if you can run paint Potato Decent Fast Rich boi Ask NASA if they have a spare computer- Become of the wonder graphics its highly recommended to play on high graphics settings.Even on my 960 i can run it on high. So there shouldn't be a real problem with the PC requirements.-{Difficulty}- Just press 'W' Easy Significant brain usage Easy to learn / Hard to master Difficult Dark Souls- From the game name itself you can understand what your going to go against.-{Grind}- Nothing to grind Only if u care about leaderboards/ranks Isnt necessary to progress Average grind level Too much grind You ll need a second live for grinding- Souls is everything in this game and if you die, you will lose all your souls and you will need to recover them. If you die while going to collect them . you lose those previous souls. (Sadness Ahead )- Plus if you meet some stronger enemy. which of course you will meet every 15-20 mins and then the enemy starts bullying you. I'm petty sure you wont stop grinding unless you can beat his ass up.-{Story}- No Story Some lore Average Good Breathe taking- The creator of this game has created an amazing story. Each and every enemy/ npc/ area and boss has a lore. And each of these lores are class. Even the storyline of each npc is great.- In short dark souls is a cycle of age of fire and age of darkness.-{Price}- It s free! Worth the price If it's on sale If u have some spare money left Not recommended You could also just burn your money- I am ready to pay any price for such games. And if there is a ds4 (if) im really willing to pay a high price for such a class game.-{Bugs}- Never heard of Minor bugs Can get annoying ARK: Survival Evolved The game itself is a big terrarium for bugs- Very rarely have seen them myself but experienced some controller and minor shuttering issues. (Probably due to new windows update being new stuff not sure)-{?/10}- 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10My final words to you:You have to play this game at least once in your lifetime.( Or any of the soul series game) To experience the difficulty and pain of playing this game. The rewards which await for you, while travelling through lothric and to linking the fire back are just amazing. Each boss you slay will give you immense joy and satisfaction.

Positive,"A great and difficult game to master with very good lore, if you can find it. At first bosses will be really hard but you will feel really good when you manage to kill the boss that just killed you more than 30 times. Combat is really awsome and diverse. There are many weapons to choose from and also magic, pyromancy and miracles for many different type of playstyles.If you want to make the game easier just play with some friends in co-op, but beware other players will be able to invade your world to kill you aswell.10/10 game in my opinion",1
Positive,"This game saved my life.I am 27.My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand. my working hand. my games hand. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot. I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ing minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.Thank you",1
Positive,"[THIS REVIEW CONTAINS NO SPOILERS ABOUT SPECIFIC BOSS FIGHTS OR LEVELS][BOUGHT IT WHEN IT WAS ON SALE FOR 18CHF] [RATING: 9.5/10]In my opinion, this is the best dark souls game in the dark-souls-frachise. This game is really challenging and the difficulty is actually suitable. One of the best things about Dark Souls 3 is that, it doesn't matter if you have never played a souls-like game before, you can still learn a different type of your playstyle and you are going to have a lot of fun by practicing it. Positive:-This game doesn't get boring. You can have such a great time because you are going through a lot of great designed stages and bosses. -The Soundtrack is on top! Almost every boss gets a remarkable theme! -If you have played Dark Souls 1 and 2, then you are going to get nostalgic feelings.-I personally don't enjoy PvP fights, but this game offers the best connection and options for those fights. -Leveling is well balanced. And if you play the DLC's, you get even more souls so you can level higher up!Negative:-To be honest, there is nothing wrong with this game. It still had a few stages that I didn't like going through and maybe they could've been better designed. But that argument doens't count much. This game made everything better than their predecessors. I had a good time playing it and enojoyed almost every single moment/boss. And yeah.this is everything you need to know before buying Dark Souls 3. I would recommend you to buy this game with the DLC's. It's better if you can buy it when it is on sale. And as always, getting information in the world wide web is at your own risk.",1

Positive,"After 66 hours of playtime I have finally beaten Dragons Dogma 2 (True Ending) and to be honest, this game turned out to be way better than I anticipated. Let me preface this review by saying that I've never played the first Dragons Dogma so I had no idea what to expect, the only thing I was aware of were the mediocre reviews which haven't changed in months so I was quite skeptical. However it's been a while since I've played a fantasy RPG and ignoring the reviews, this game looked quite promising so I gave it a shot.I'll start off with the negative just to get it out of the way:The story, characters and quest design are utter d@gshit, bottom of the barrel garbage. Considering how seemingly focused this game is on its world building and story telling, it's laughable how little effort they actually put into writing good characters or a coherent story. It starts off somewhat promising with a solid prologue and the lore of the world seems interesting enough, but that's about where it ends. As soon as you reach the capital you quickly start to realize that Capcom must have hired crack addicts to write the story for them, because nothing that characters say or do and nothing that the game tells you to do over the course of the main story is in any way engaging or fun from a story telling or quest design standpoint: Fetch quest after fetch quest, running from point A to point B etc. etc. and the pay-off is 3 lines of dialogue telling you to go somewhere else again. Nothing interesting happens, ever (until you reach the end, then it gets kinda good-ish). There are barely even any cutscenes, the vast majority of dialogue is accompanied by uninspired, oblivion-style camera zooms toward whoever is currently talking, it makes the already uninteresting dialogue even more boring to listen to PLUS you have to press a button after every single goddamn line to progress. Am I playing an MMO? What's going on here? And yes I have watched lore videos, read articles and explanations about both DD2 and DD1 to try and make sense of the story and while I mostly get it now, other than the overall concept of the world itself and the cycle, I still think it's incredibly uninteresting. I think it's comparable to Fromsoft games in many ways, though the reason why Fromsoft's stories work and Dragon's Dogma's doesn't, is that Fromsoft doesn't try to shove its story down your throat, it's essentially optional, whereas DD2's story is a huge part of the game. And while cryptic, Fromsoft's stories are still well thought out and make sense once you actually try to understand them, even if a lot of it is left up for interpretation, Capcom just didn't even bother thinking about whether or not something actually makes sense but simply expects you to accept it.Now, story aside, what's the gameplay like? It's absolutely incredible. DD2 genuinely has some of the most fun and engaging gameplay I've ever seen in a video game, the world somehow feels incredibly alive despite it's dull story and characters, the exploration feels rewarding (more on this later) and the combat is so extremely fun I don't know if I'll be able to go back to some of my favorite RPGs like The Witcher 3 or Skyrim again, because it's not even remotely a competition. There are 10 different vocations (I have maxxed out 2 of them) that all play and feel completely differently with a different moveset, playstyle, about a dozen different skills each, different weapons and armor, you can essentially become whoever you want. The character customization is also fantastic.When I first saw combat of DD2 I thought that climbing on top of enemies looks fun but also feels like a gimmick you'll probably get bored of fairly quickly. I was so wrong. There is nothing more epic than fighting a Griffin, jumping on its back and slamming a huge hammer into the back of its head to make it stagger and fall to the ground, it never gets old. On top of all this there's also the pawn system which essentially allows you to have 1-3 NPC followers at all times. It made exploring the world a lot less lonely, plus they made combat not only easier but also a lot more fun and dynamic, it's a great feature. The movement in DD2 is also incredibly good. The climbing, running, jumping etc. feels just right with the perfect amount of inertia, even simply traversing the world is fun in and of itself.Now I've seen a lot of people complain about the fact that exploration feels unrewarding and while I get where they're coming from, I can't say I agree. You don't get bombarded with gear in every single cave and outpost like in Elden Ring for example, but instead you'll find a lot of upgrade materials and other useful items with the occasional weapon or piece of armor every few hours, most of your gear you'll have to buy in cities and then upgrade with the materials you found while out exploring. I honestly really like this concept of getting new equipment, it feels more grounded in a way and when you DO find a weapon that also just so happens to belong to the class you're currently using, it feels even more special. One issue I have with the gear system however, is how the game prevents you from wearing armor that belongs to a different class until you get the Warfarer a the end.Another complaint I've read about a lot is the lack of enemy variety and quite frankly, this has not once bothered me during my entire playthrough. Obviously it's not on Elden Ring's level of enemy variety, but the only reason Elden Ring has so many unique enemies is because its combat is incredibly simple and straightforward. Sure you have hundreds of different weapons, but they don't offer you anywhere near as much variety in playstyle as DD2's class system does. In Elden Ring, the way you fight enemies is dodge, dodge, hit, dodge, dodge, hit, which is completely fine and works well because it makes up for that by just having a sh1t ton of enemies. DD2 does it the opposite way, it doesn't have nearly as many unique enemy types, but instead offers you a combat system that you won't ever get bored of after dozens if not hundreds of hours of gameplay. Keep in mind there are 10 classes and I've only maxxed out 2 after almost 70 hours of playtime. Before getting to the last popular complaint I quickly want to address how beautiful this game looks. The graphics are just phenomenal, the vegetation looks incredibly realistic and dense, the textures are clean and the particle effects add so much life to the magic, explosions and the like, it truly feels next gen. The game does have some performance issues, but it generally wasn't an issue for me and even in the worst cases didn't drop below 30fps on a 2060S on almost max settings. Really the only problem I've had were the SSR which left some pretty intense artifacts when moving the camera so I had to turn it off. Lastly, the final complaint I want to talk about is the lack of different biomes and my honest answer to that is: have we played the same game? If you seriously believe that this game is lacking biome variety, then go back to Skyrim, go back to Fallout 4 and go back to The Witcher 3 and tell me how they're any different. Yes half of DD2's map is populated by forests and fields, but so is Skyrim's map and so is The Witcher 3's map, yet they all ""make up for this"" by having sub-biomes in those forests and fields which despite them generally looking very similar, still manages to give all of them a unique atmosphere and feel, both from a visual- and gameplay standpoint. Not to mention the second country which offers a massive canyon / desert-like area and a volcanic island.In conclusion: to someone that hasn't played the first title, Dragon's Dogma 2 is an incredible game, with fantastic gameplay, exploration, graphics and a sense of adventure that not a lot of RPGs can replicate, but it is unfortunately held back by an utterly atrocious storyline, terrible quest design and forgettable characters.

Positive,You'll never wonder where a ladder is again,1
Positive,They finally did it. It took them 6 months but the game finally runs well. After the latest update my fps at the very least doubled in populated cities,1
Positive,"If you re looking for some screenshots click here to view all the ones I took for this game.Follow our Curator page, Summit Reviews, to see more high-quality reviews regularly.As the Arisen, you re inextricably tied to a prophecy: command the Pawns, servants spawned by mystical powers, and alongside them either defeat or be slain by the Dragon a cycle that repeats from time immemorial. However, this time around something is different, and the cycle may take an unexpected turn.DD2 takes place in a high-fantasy medieval world, encompassing the once-warring kingdoms of Vernworth and Batthal, and their surrounding environs. All locations, from ancient ruins and caves to lush forests and sandy canyons, are extremely detailed and appealing. A particular mention has to be made for the draw distance, capable of showing minute details across huge distances. Each character model is detailed, be them monsters, NPCs or your very own companions; the extensive customization options ensure no two Pawns are the same.The story starts off strongly, and opens up to interesting events soon enough. This tale of one s will against a predetermined destiny has enough uniqueness to stand out without falling into the clich s of its own premise, however, it rushes things way too much later on, at the expense of narration and character development. The ones that encompass the story are interesting, albeit it always feels like they don t have the screen time or the narrative depth they deserve; all is dragged onward by events that don t leave space for aught.You ll traverse the world on foot, and eventually using paid transportation in the form of Oxcarts, to travel between cities, or Ferrystones, magical items allowing you to travel instantaneously anywhere a Portcrystal is present; these can be placed by the Arisen or premade, but they re extremely rare. This opens to one of the main issues: backtracking. Even if exploring is interesting, having to pave the same road 15 times to go to-and-fro to clear quests, fighting the same filler mobs, gets tiresome. There are a tremendous amount of hidden caves, dungeons, chests scattered everywhere; many contain unique or rare items, money, and gear.There aren t markers to know who has a quest for you, or where you need to go in most cases. Everything in DD2 happens organically and realistically, with NPCs being in different places at different times, or completely unavailable after specific events. Everyone can die; everyone can be revived with the proper items. This concept is double-edged: on one side, provides excellent immersion and roleplay realism, but on the other makes many quests very obscure and finicky in their logic to be solved, on top of being time-sensitive this can lead to frustration when one fails and the game slaps an autosave in your face.The combat gameplay largely depends on your chosen Vocation, meaning Class. You can freely change classes in any settlement, and level up each independently, with the relative gear and weapon restrictions. The same goes for your main Pawn, an inseparable companion that will always follow you alongside two others, summoned at Rift Stones, which act as companion hubs to adapt the party s composition to your liking. Not all vocations are available from the start: many are hidden behind quests and interactions, some of which tremendously obscure. Each Vocation plays out differently, and has its own skills, passives and nuances for you to discover. This keeps the combat gameplay fresh and compelling: unlocking new vocations and abilities on a constant basis, not limiting yourself and your Pawn to one class expands the variety tremendously. Most of them all find their place in the combat roles except the Trickster, it just sucks.In a fight, smaller foes can be thrown, knocked over, and subjected to a variety of status effects or elemental damage types to which they may be weak or resistant. Enemies are well-diversified and have remarkable moveset complexity, and will even in-fight between factions, while some of them only spawn at specific times or areas. However, the true stars are large foes that each have unique mechanics, weak spots and quirks. You and your pawns can grapple them, climb their very bodies to impale, slash and pummel, or push them aground when their balance is lost after many blows. They dynamically reflect the damages they sustain: a blind cyclops will be enraged, a wingless gryphon, furious. Depending on how you slay such foes, you might even get unique materials for crafting and weapon improvement at blacksmiths.Defeating foes and clearing quests will award DCP and XP, which respectively count for the single vocation you re using, or globally for the character level. DCP can be spent at the Vocation Guild to learn new abilities, perks and learn entire Vocations for yourself and your main Pawn, while the other Pawns can t be leveled or edited but instead must be dismissed and replaced with better ones at some point. All pawns can be used by other players simultaneously, and in turn absorb treasure, foe and quest knowledge that then you can use for yourself to have an easier time getting things done or finding loot.",1
Positive,"Pros:- The world looks amazing and stunning. It's huge!- More options for fast travel, no spoilers, explore it!- Multiple vocations (classes) than can be changed anytime in cities/villages.- Combat is fluid, not clunky.- Lots of items, there are things that can only be found in different places because it's like an exclusive.- Option to buy stuffs for real money for players that don't want to grind. Everything can be achievable for free so you don't need to pay for it if you like grinding!- Pawn system is fun, you can meet other players Pawns and when you dismiss them you can even give feedback and a gift to the other player.- During a sale, it is definitely worth buying, you can have a lot of fun with Dragon's Dogma 2!Cons:- Optimization problems mostly in the cities.- The variety of enemies can get pretty boring if you stay in the same area for long periods of time.- The dialogues of the Pawns can be repeated several times within a short time, which can frustrate some players.- Pawns roam the map and different Pawns may repeatedly try to stop you to introduce themselves to you to try to recruit them. Some people are bothered by this, but if you avoid them and not go close to them, this can be avoided.- It has a hate train because of these: The microtransactions which is optional, bad launch and this is not a sequel of the first game, but rather a reboot. There are things that were in Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen that are missing from Dragon's Dogma 2.Beside the problems Dragon's Dogma 2 has I really enjoy it's gameplay. Hopefully we'll get a DLC that fixes the existing issues and will arrive with a lot of new content. Thank you for reading!",1
Positive,"being almost 70 years old normally i cannot play games like this as my manual dexterity just is not on par. however having AI control my partner and my two hirelings allows me to form a well rounded party and when tough fights come they make up for any slack from me. i have over 240 hours in this game and have loved every minute of it. i wish there were more games like this for those of us with physical imitations. this game is completely playable as long as you have a sharp mind more than a sharp sword. Cudos to Capcom. other than thaty i will spend about 10 seconds on saying what every one else has. the graphics are stunning,the gameplay is smooth,the storyline is enticing for me a 11/10",1
Positive,"I've tried to figure out if this game was a disappointment or not since it came out. A few people I know are pretty firmly in the camp of ""yes it is"" but I'm quite a bit more torn. In most respects, it is exactly what I expected from a sequel to Dragon's Dogma. The enemy variety is a bit better, the classes are interesting, the pawns are actually less annoying if you can believe that (they are still so annoying though) but is this really enough? I'm not sure, In my country of Canada the game is ninety five dollars. the game is $95. This videogame is five dollars short from being one hundred dollars. and on release I paid that (I didnt feel that bad because I had just gotten my tax refund, but still) Is it worth that? I dont think so. But did I enjoy this game? Yes, quite a lot. Is it repetitive? Yeah, it is, but having just replayed the first game, I felt massive improvements in nearly every single way. The combat is better, the variety of enemies is better, the skills are more interesting. The end game fell short. Its like a reverse Dragon's Dogma. The first game was just OK until the endgame where it becomes something much more, this game is good until the endgame where it falls flat and becomes less. I think this game did disappoint me. But only after 48 hours of playing it. I think thats a lot of value to get out of a game. But its still a bit of a sour aftertaste.",1
Positive,"Looking back twelve years later, it's clear that the original Dragon's Dogma earned its well-deserved cult following not only for what it had to offer, but for what it could have been. The clear signs of cut or unfinished content became obvious to anyone who spent enough time with the game, and series creator Hideaki Itsuno's 2013 GDC presentation touting the finished product as being only half of what they had envisioned for the game only helped to fan those flames. It was not uncommon to see the game described as ""the best 7/10 game ever made"", or ""an unfinished gem"". In my review of the game, I made the bold claim that while Dragon's Dogma was not the greatest ARPG ever created, it was the tech demo for it.Fast-forward a decade, and against all odds, Capcom was actually convinced to take a risk on greenlighting a sequel. While initially cautiously optimistic, further trailers and presentations only increased enthusiasm of many long-time fans of the series, helmed by Itsuno's claims that the sequel's design philosophy was to be a faithful as possible to the original. As it turns out, this claim was painfully accurate.Dragon's Dogma 2 is a game that performs worse in as many categories as it improves on Dragon's Dogma 1. To give a small sample: The artstyle was perfectly translated to the new engine and the increased graphical fidelity that came with it. Character creator is more robust, adding new customization options that make character designs more unique (even though everyone still only makes waifu pawns.) Combat movement/positioning (standing on top of monsters, more verticality via moves and nearby terrain) Enemies will fight each other, call reinforcements, and multiple boss monsters can appear at once. Pawn dialogue (pawns will respond to each other, talk about contextual topics like their vocations, etc.) A larger, more fleshed-out (yet still unfinished and somewhat underutilized) world that facilitates the sense of adventure that the game strives for. A near complete lack of loading screens also greatly helps this sense of adventure and immersion. Emphasis on foot travel, planning out your party composition and equipment, requiring the use of hub areas for rest and restocking. Superior (yet clearly unfinished) endgame. The endgame expands on the overarching lore of the world and the cycle that binds it. Combat movement (Arguably. Some players dislike the added weight and delay compared to the snappy movement of DD1. I disagree in most scenarios, except for how monster parkour is not nearly as viable anymore.) You can pinpoint the coronation cutscene as the exact moment the main questline begins to absolutely fall apart. The entire Battahl arc is a clearly unfinished, disjointed string of quests that are confusing either for your character's motives, or how they are meant to weave into anything else going on around you. Most NPCs are completely uninteresting and little more than set pieces. Dragon's Dogma 1 had tons of NPCs with important dialogue relating to the world, quests, and other characters, which would update with new dialogue the further you progressed the main story. This is almost completely absent in DD2. The heavy emphasis on NPC interactivity, not only with the player, but with other NPCs is allegedly the main cause of the performance issues that still plague this game for many people with even mid-range setups. This feature ends up being barely noticeable, and is absolutely not worth the cost to CPU performance. The loss of the gauntlet, boot, and underclothes slots makes fashion much less varied, especially with how class-restricted much of the armor is. Not enough context-based core skills to warrant the loss of 2 skill slots compared to DD1. Less skills to choose from compared to DD1, especially for mages/sorcs. Severe lack of David Lodge voicing the Dragon (although the new VA did a pretty decent job.)From my perspective, very few of the issues that I have with this game boil down to it's actual design philosophy. Many people do not like the constant walking, or how it does not hold you hand, with many quests and mechanics being left up to the player to discover. This game is not going to appeal to everyone, and that is fine. They doubled down on many aspects of the philosophy from the first game, and I am happy that they did.In reality, the most damning problem that this game has it that it has managed to fall into nearly every single development-related pitfall that befell Dragon's Dogma 1. Most of my gripes about this game are not about what they did , but what they did not or could not do.Was it rushed out the door to increase quarterly profits? Was it never given the budget, time, and development team size that it needed in the first place? Did it suffer from complications due to work-at-home restrictions during the pandemic, or because of issues that needed to be resolved while translating the RE Engine to an open world setting? Was it mismanaged by directors and producers, and doomed to fail regardless of any other problems that may or may not have occurred during development? I don't know. I don't think we'll ever know.If you are confused as to why this is marked as a positive review, I do not blame you. The easy answer is that Steam's rating system, just like every other modern platform's binary ""like/dislike"" system, is stupid.The more nuanced answer is that I have been harsh on this game only because it feels like it could be so much more than what it is, and after now experiencing this feeling for two games in a row, I have much less sympathy to offer. I am disappointed in the final product, and yet at the same time, Dragon's Dogma offers so many things that cannot be found in any other game. It is a rollercoaster of quality, but its peaks stand high above most other games. At the end of the day I still enjoyed my time with Dragon's Dogma 2.Regardless of what happened to this game, there is a faint glimmer of hope, as Capcom executives seem to have realized the potential this series has, claiming it to be among their ""core franchises"". Whether it be updates to the base game, expansions, or an eventual sequel, only time will tell whether they will keep their word and finally give us a fully realized product, or if we are doomed to repeat this cycle of wondering what could have been.",1
Positive,"Exploration? 10/10Combat? 9/10Quests? 3/10Writing? 0/10Performance? 4/10There is not a single fun or engaging quest in this game and even the main quests consist of walking somewhere and reporting back, sometimes with unexplained game mechanics such as stealth which isn't really a thing in the game. Some quests just break if you don't do what the game expected you to do and either magically disappear from your quest log without warning or stick around basically forever despite you not being able to complete the quest at all.Performance while exploring was fine for my Gaming Laptop with an RTX 3070 and intel i7, getting 59 - 60 FPS, but inside cities I was getting 15 - 30 FPSThe dialogue and story are incredibly bad, rarely making sense at all and entirely unintriguing.Thankfully, however, the story and quests are maybe 10% of the game, if that. I remember 3 or 4 story quests that were actually necessary so you can technically beat the game in a few hours. I explored pretty much every corner after 78 hours of playing.BUT the exploring and atmosphere during your travels is some of the best I've ever experienced. The limitations can be taxing if you're too used to the comfort of fast travelling anywhere and having a character that can carry the world in their item pouch but if you're willing to work with the limitations this game sets on you it will be an incredible experience. Having to decide how far you can go before having to return to a city or whether it's worth to set up camp to recuperate helps the player feel like a real part of this beautiful but dangerous world.The enemy variety isn't huge but varied enough that it never bothered me.TLDR: If you, like me, don't care about story or quests but do love exploring an intricate, beautiful, and atmospheric world with great combat that is hugely varied depending on your Vocation (class) I highly recommend Dragon's Dogma 2.If you prefer story-driven games or put high value on quests then stay far, far away. Seriously, the worst quests I've ever experienced in a video game with writing you'd expect from a 15 student's game project after which you'd feel robbed of said 15 .Quick little edit regarding quests after being halfway through NG+ where I put more effort into trying to experience everything that isn't just exploration:On my original playthrough, I seem to have missed pretty much all the decent quests due to not talking to the right people or not checking back enough with specific NPCs in far away towns so I pretty much only got the worst quests in the game. This essentially changes my opinion about quests from ""worst quests I've ever experienced in a video game"" to ""the quests are fine but some of them are plain terrible"".Also, because there seem to be some people who question my recommendation of the game when I'm so overly negative in the review and Steam doesn't allow me to answer comments directly: Read the TLDR, it sums up my reasons for recommending the game overall and not recommending it to specific people.",1
Positive,"I was really on the fence if I should give a recommendation or not on this game. This is probably both one of the best and most frustrating gaming experiences I have ever had at the same time. I don't think I have experienced a product that is so impressive and at the same time so sloppy. I absolutely adore the first Dragons Dogma and I actually replayed it again just prior to starting up Dragons Dogma 2. Upon playing the first Dragons Dogma I reflected again over how incredible immersive your companion Pawns where in how they commented on things in the environment in a context dependent manner.After playing Dragons Dogma 2 though it is just so frustrating to feel like the Pawn behavior is a huge step back from the first game. They CONSTANTLY repeat the same dialogue lines over and over and over again, and most of it is even nonsense and non helpful, like telling you for the 1000 time that you can combine stuff when you are 100 hours into the game and have already done this 1000 times before. I keep saying shut the **** up in annoyance constantly. This never ever happened in the first game even after playing 100 hours and they never annoyed me.It is really insufferable how much they repeat the same lines over and over again. I also find that there is much less context dependent comments on unique environmental features like in the first game, but that is less of an issue when compared to the constant nag. Also even the context of when they speak is extremely sloppy. Many times I make camp and 3 seconds after having camped some Pawn makes a comment on how we probably are not in need of camping just now. Or they ask if I need guidance to a cave when I stand 1 meter from the opening of it. It is constant and incredibly annoying. It is such a shame because the game is incredible immersive in most other aspects but this completely and utterly ruin all that illusion of an immersive real world with these Pawns. There are other issues with the game, but for me this is really the main gripe.Repeating dialogue is really an immersive killer in most games, but it is really critical here since having the Pawns behave in a natural manner is such a big part of the game and something that was really nailed in the first game and such an unique feature of what that game was and how it stood out from other. Just implementing some cooldown on how often dialogue can repeat would go a long way to making the Pawns feel less fake and artificial which is the complete opposite of what should be the goal here. The game really feels like some masterpiece painting by a great artist and then some clowns come in and throw faeces all over it. The repeating dialogue almost single-handedly takes one of the most immersive worlds I have seen in a game and completely demolish it. Anyhow that is my main gripe. Some other pros and cons though:Pros: - Extremely beautiful graphics with amazing looking animations- No loading between areas or going into towns or dungeons etc- Beautiful music when exploring- Good controls and characters have a sense of physics to their movement- Quests are not entirely hand holding like in most other games and sometimes you actually have to think for yourself- No cheap quick travel, and like in the first game the quick travel system is actually implemented in the game world, especially love how when you throw a ferrystone up in the air and it hits a roof it fails to trigger, in-game logic increases believability and immersion in he game world (though I understand if it can be a bit constraining to some players and probably they ""nerfed"" the portalstones etc to be able to sell them as microtransactions (bad)- Nice system I have not seen before where many quest givers actually initiate conversation with you in a natural manner as you go near instead of having a system with fake looking ""!"" markers above their head like in most other games- Elves in this game actually look like how Elves are supposed to look like- Great character creator and from my understanding some of the actual physical elements of your character like their height and weight determine movement speed to some extentCons:- Again the repeating dialogue of the Pawns almost destroy the game but enough said about that- The game has performance issues (especially in cities) and even DLSS does not seem to make much of a difference- ""Microtransactions""- Dungeon (cave) design are really really really repetitive and are only caves really in different sizes. One of the best aspects of the original Dragons Dogma was how incredible good the level design was in some of the dungeons with atmospheric elements like flowing streams in the floor or just a huge sense of detail both in design and soundscape to some of them. The lack of variety in dungeons and locations really hurt the sense of wonder and exploration as when you have seen the first cave you have pretty much seen them all- Difficulty is really trivial and most of the time it feels like just swapping annoying flies when dealing with the enemy mobs (except for some of the huge ones that are more bullet sponges until you have the equipment for them). Having pretty much infinite potential for healing with items does not help with quick buttons that just refills your health instantly without even needing a drink or eat animation etc just destroy all aspects of any difficulty. The developers should really look at implementing something more akin to how healing is handled in Dark Souls/Elden Ring. The permanent reduction of healing that needs to be refilled by sleeping is a good feature though imo.- The sound mixing is atrocious and probably the worst I have ever seen (heard). You have to constantly adjust the volume down or up as you get your ears blown out with the combat music in battle that drowns out all other sound- Mobs of enemies are placed way to frequent in the game world which just feels fake and artificial and you can barely move a step until there is another group of enemies are on you. Because the difficulty is so trivial they more become an annoyance than something that feels like a treat as you try to traverse around the environment- Enemies also respawn way to frequent. It would be nice to actually be able to clear out areas, especially in the routes of the Oxcarts to make travel easier without getting jumped by enemies. It feels like enemies respawns in areas after just a day when really it should be after a week ingame at the least- Capcom made human Pawns are incredibly ugly and just look unfitting to the game. It does not help that ""for some reason"" like half of all the names are not matching the genders of the characters so you will have males named Lisa or Sofia and females named Peter and Gregory etc - While the initiation of dialogue is a great thing for quest givers etc this is also used on Pawns you meet on the road and they interrupt you with a conversation if you get to near which can be extremely annoying- The game has incredible vistas with huge mountains so it is a massive bummer to discover that much of it has invisible walls that prevents you from going to many places. - Not a fan how shopkeepers stand in place 24/7 even at night. Some more routine in their behavior would be welcome and having closed at night etc- The feature of having to have a Pawn that understands Elvish and that can interpret to the player as they speak would be an incredible original idea if implemented right. Imagine as an Elf speaks in a foreign language to the player and your Pawn conveying what is said to you in ""real time"". It would be really unique idea that would enhance the believability of the game world. However how this was implemented in the game just flushed all that potential down the toilet by just having what they say in text if you have a translator. And you even have to go to options to turn Subtitles on if you have them off or you will not even see what they say anyway. Word count reached",1
Positive,I was so immersed in exploring the world that I almost forgot there was a main story,1
Positive,"You don't need anything from the online store at all. The game is fun, chaotic and makes you feel like a badass.",1
Positive,"This game plays like the devs attempted everything in their power to sabotage themselves and make people hate it. Luckily they even failed at that and accidentally made a fun game. Ignore the mtx, you can find and duplicate every item in a matter of minutes.Great game but buy it on sale.",1
Positive,"Dragon's Dogma 2 is a 2012 game dressed in 2024 graphics, it's a decent game but you should only pick it up on sale in my opinion. Here are some pros and cons to summarize my thoughts on the game:+ Open World Exploration. There is always a cave to explore, a chest to loot, or a boss to battle. You'll spend dozens of hours immersing yourself in DD2's open world as it's the shining star of the game.+ Combat. The variety of vocations (classes) DD2 has is impressive. From melee-focused classes like the sword-and-shield fighter who excels in drawing out enemy attention and climb on bosses, to ranged classes like the Archer who is best at targeting specific parts of bosses, to dexterity-based classes like the Thief who is fast and can steal items from enemies, to magic wielders like the Mage who can offer boosts and healing spells to your party. Not to mention advanced vocations that add more unique playstyles.+ Graphics. Not really much to say, the RE Engine proves once again that it's one the best engines in the industry.+ Pawn system, just like the Nemesis system from Shadow of Mordor, pawns are underrated and should be added to more RPGs. Pawns hired will support players in guiding them through quests, catch them when they fall from heights, loot and hold items, as well as finding treasures and caves that you may have missed. My only two gripes about pawns are A. they need more meaningful dialogue and B. I just wish Capcom would expand on the system further, add CO-OP or the ability to give orders to pawns like shooting locks or boost the players to reach unreachable locations.- AI. The AI of pawns can be bad at times. One time my pawns stood around during a boss battle not targeting the specific parts needed to defeat the boss I was fighting as a Trickster which made the fight literally impossible, also a few times I was pinned down or stunned and they'll watch you suffer in silence. The bad AI made me quit using the Trickster and Sorcerer vocations. - Story. Pretty bare-bones story with weak writing.- Performance & Bugs. The game is poorly optimized for the CPU side of the game (as evident by the major FPS drops in NPC busy areas), DD2 is the first RE Engine title with high-density complex NPCs so performance issues are to be expected. Hopefully, Capcom will work on CPU optimization more because I can't see how Monster Hunter Wilds will perform with the same issues. DD2 is also quite buggy. There is a chance to bug out of side quests like the game did to me.- Save system. Being able to save anywhere is great. However, Capcom's decision against adding save slots is a stupid one. - Microtransaction. You don't need to buy any but still, there is no reason to add microtransactions in full-priced $70 games.",1
Positive,"It seems like most people have forgotten what Dragon's Dogma was before the Dark Arisen release.Edits marked with **First of all I got to say: I'm not defending Micro transaction or the Devs choice to add them. If you want to give this game a bad review because of that then its totally understandable. But some reviews are very misleading and paints the Devs as more of evil mustachio twirling villains than they are. This is by no way close to Blizzard or other companies in level of disgusting. 1: Fast travel with portcrystals are locked behind a MT paywall: This is false. In my playthrough i gained 4-5 portcrystals just from exploring and doing quests. It was enough to space them out for easy travel. Most of the times I actually used the oxen service because I was out of ferry stones. 2: Character edit is locked behind a MT paywall. This is also false. Right now you only have 2 FULL recreation ""tickets"" per playthrough. The **Devs have now uped it to 99. These cost 500 RC which is really easy to get and you will have enough of them by mid game to basically never worry about them.3: No multiple characters, option to start over: Some has stated that this is a ""Lack of freedom"" to try out different vocations: This is just wrong, since you can change vocations when ever you want and you no longer have to level different vocations for your end build like in the previous games. **They have now added a ""Start a New game"" that overwrites your current file.4: Performance issues. Yes, this game has some horrendous performance in major cities. The devs are aware of this as well and are working on a solution. But I have seen people with hardware waaaay below the recommended specs complain about this: No shit it will stutter if you have a i5 gen 8 when the game is depending so much on a strong CPU. I had a constant of 70-60 fps whilst outside of towns, inside the towns i had 30-50 with major drops when a town was attacked. Every thing on max, dlls on quality. 2560x1440. (Specs at bottom)** Performance is better but still wobbly in Cities. 5: FinalOk so everyone please lay down your torches and pick-forks for a second and look at the MT content they offer. It's all in the game already. You don't have to pay anything extra to enjoy the game as the game was intended: Exploration, time consuming as it is but none the less. ""If you ""ONLY"" have ""10 HOURS"" in the game you haven't even played it!"" Even if the above statement is ridiculous its true. This game will take time. A review talking about ingame content or lacking of content that is under 10 hours has not even left the first area of the map. and have not explored that area to 100%. THE BIG BUT:Every fix is still just a promise. ""They will add"", ""They will fix"", ""In coming patches"", ""Don't worry the dragons are coming"". ** Right now its only performance that is still an issue. OK NOW TO THE GAME! ** After almost doing a 100% on this game: Story is decent but:I just finished the main story and I have to say. It felt short. Now I see you looking at my almost 100 hours at the time of this review and hold up, wait a minute!I did a lot of stuff side quests, almost all vocations and their ultimate skills, romances: you name it. But I didn't do it all. And that says a lot about the content that's in the game. But the main quest felt like you where following a breadcrumb trail while enjoying the scenery -which can be really nice specially when the areas looks great and have a lot of details. This game is a ADHD nightmare, I'm not diagnosed but every chance I got: I said ""Fuck you"" to the pawn Guiding me to a quest to see what this other path lead. And oh boy there are some awesome areas you miss out on if you just blaze through the game. Some argue it's the same game again. Well yes, like the darksouls game are technically the same game again. BUT WAIT THERE IS MORE!The modding community has already been working like crazy, and you can already find mods like ""Unlimited Stamina outside of battle"" And ""Real FOV slider"". And surly more is to come. The World and Its Inhabitants: I would summarize the game to be on the level of Dragons Dogma 1 when it comes to variations of enemies. You have your standards of Goblins, skeletons, lizardos, bandidos, draginos, ogrerrendae. cyclopos DAdeiahfgeslf. The list goes on. But they also have dark variants for the bigger monsters and a couple of new ones. These enemies walk around their respective areas but can be seen fighting from time to time.I have seen some reviews saying there's a lack of variations but there are like 4-5 different variations of Saurians that is not just a dark variant. They are made from different elements and live in different climates and look pretty cool. That's basically the feeling of the world, everything is pretty cool. Untill a Gryphin wrecks my desert crank lift and wipes my whole party.There are random quests that pop up here and there, with people to save, monsters to cull, or escort missions. They are ok but it would be nice if the Escort person would actually say WHERE THEY WANT TO GO before you accept it. I might be wanting to hunt down a dragon in the area, walked from the capital and camped to get here and they just want to be escorted to the capital. No way peasant you are now on the dragon hunter squad. Vocations: I was really sad to see that the assasain was removed as it was my go to vocation in DD1. So we got Theif and Archer. No daggers AND bow. Just daggers OR bow.I felt my breathing going faster and my typing fingers loading up to rant about why I hated this but I calmed down and gave the Theif and Archer a chance. And now. I like it. With all the Vocations and special Vocations from DD1, and specially with the new Spear Hand (Which is totally op and broken af but more of that later.) most of the ""Regular"" vocations would be, well obsolete. They would only be an annoying hurdle to pass to get to the vocation you wanted. With this new system, all Vocations are unique and dare I say fun. (Buff Archer ult pls its so baby tier rn m reowshrsji brdb)OK. Imagine being a Jedi that can tank any attack in the game. Even the dragoins meteor showers and Lightning attacks. Imagine being FUS RO DA YEETED off High Hrhorghharhhf, just to stand up and dust yourself off. Imagine being able to teleport around the fight like Narutos Daddy throwing shit on the enemy and just appearing on them. NOW IMAGINE BEING ABLE TO SPEAR THE HEART OF A DRAGON WITH A POWERFUL MAGIC PROJECTILE THAT WILL MAKE THE DRAGON BACKFLIP INTO THE SKY RIGHT THROUGH THE MOON. This is the Spear Hand vocation. Ok that might be too much but you get my meaning. The vocation actually have a bubble spell. It makes you immune to ALL DMG for a short while. Ok how short? Are we talking like .5 secs so you have to time it perfectly? No its like 4 seconds. It outlasts most channel attacks. And it costs so little stamina so you can keep it up an entire boss fight. And it bubbles your pawns as well. I no joke, didn't take a single point of dmg from the end boss when I challanged him with this class. And none of my pawns died. There was ""Tools"" in the boss arena that could be used on the boss. But I didnt even have to use them. Just Bubble away. It takes a lot of time to get any where and it can be confusing to figure out what the game wants from you. Or what you can expect from the game. But then the areas are so nice so some people wont mind the time taken, some people like to figure everything out even if it might be cryptic and non nonsensical at times. Its not a game where you can get a feel of it within the refund time. This is not Dark Arisen: its going to lack some quality of life things. Only buy at full price if you are sure you are going to enjoy it. Im off to NG+ Have a nice one.Specs: Win: 10 x64CPU: Gen 11, i9-11900fGPU: 3070 TI RTX RAM: 32 gig.",1

Positive,"It was definitely possible if not outright likely this sequel would not be dragon's dogma. The game design could have died a death by a thousand antithetical cuts at the hands of suits and contemporary standards. But, for better or worse, here's dragon's dogma 2. They didn't mess with it.You will jump and climb on giant monsters and stab them in the eye while stuffing potatoes into your face. You will hear your pawn remark about the same ladder in Vernworth more times than you've heard ""hello"" in your lifetime. The story is anemic and arbitrary, forgetting its own beats. The characters are plentiful but cardboard. There are two saves. You will lose pawns to terrain despite your best micromanaging. Your pawn will pick up all your worst combat habits and embarrass you in front of strangers online. Progression scaling is lackluster: you will feel hopelessly desperate at the beginning only to wake up one level and feel like god. Fast travel is artificially limited but similarly scaled where suddenly you are awash in ferrystones. Big mob hunting is made more tedious by the large map, and minotaurs are the griffins of this title it feels like. Quests are still easy to bungle due to time, progress, or simply missing them. And, most importantly, all of this is gift wrapped in the meta of the dragon's literal dogma so of course everything I just mentioned is thematically deliberate and why there's no ""2"" in the main menu title.Frankly, it was everything I wanted and once again, my complaint is give me more.But that's obviously not my only complaint. I actually didn't have many crashes in 100 hours but the game still runs like molten molasses. Framerates are mostly fine in the wilderness but low in cities which is mildly problematic later on. Normally this would be least concern, easiest fixed, but the fact the game shipped like this, that they thought even the poor performance on the PS5 was acceptable, hints that maybe that's not the case. Beaucoup hardware won't save you here. Something is fundamentally wrong and it's currently setting your CPU on fire while the frames hitch.If you like dragon's dogma, warts and all, and circumstances have prevented you from buying it at release, try it anyway. I found it playable on my potato rig once I acclimated to the framerate dips. If you think you could like dragon's dogma, play dark arisen instead as the price point for curiosity is lower (5 bucks on sale usually) and it won't melt your rig. If you didn't like dragon's dogma 1, this isn't going to change your mind and you'd just be engaging the definition of insanity.",1
Positive,"This is a great game that is very hard to recommend. First things first - microtransactions don't matter at all, ignore them, the game is balanced in the exact same way that the first game was. In fact, it's almost a note by note remake of the first one in a lot of aspects - that is, after all, the Dogma of the dragon. The map is much, much bigger, the animations are smoother, the fighting is more fun and fluid, but the vibe, the sense of adventure and the main plot points are roughly the same. So if you liked the first one - it's a no-brainer.If you're a new-comer - it's kind of hard to explain the feelings that this game provides, because on the face of it for an RPG it's a fairly weak entry, plot-dialogue-writing-wise. Definitely don't get this game for the plot. But if you like exploring and a sense of an actual adventure, where you have to prepare for venturing outside the city, where the night is dark and scary and something unexpected is constantly happening, then the game might be up your alley.Keep in mind though: at the time of writing the performance is still quite abysmal and the game is heavily CPU-bound, especially in the city areas. There are DLSS3 framegen mods that can slightly help with that if you're on RTX40xx and I've heard that modern AM5 CPUs can chug through the shitty Denuvo-ridden code, but still - it's very poorly optimized. The TAA implementation is also completely abysmal, the shimmering/ghosting grass looks awful here.So - a good game at the core. Maybe not the best implementation though. Hope it sold well and hope they'll keep patching it.",1
Positive,"Pre-Review MTX Rant: The Microtransactions are VERY UNWELCOME in this game. However, two things are true about them and I refuse to sugar coat the reality of the situation about them:1) They were the exact same in original Dragon's Dogma game (if you don't believe me go check the Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen store page), and they were a HUGE success for Capcom back then. They didn't ""sneak"" the MTX into this title. They were always going to be part of it. I fully expected it to happen, and everyone else should have as well. Capcom has NEVER been innocent in the MTX market. They've been a big proponent of them for a long, long time.2) YOU have the power to send the message to Capcom that the MTX are unwelcome by NOT BUYING THEM!Seriously. It's not that hard. Unless you're some pathetic, ill-educated, and pre-pubescent child with no sense of self control over how irresponsibly you spend your parent's money because they were stupid enough to link their credit card to your account, don't buy them!Down voting the game because you hate the fact that there are MTX present DOES NOT send the message you think it does. When you mass downvote the game all it tells Capcom is that we, as a consumer base, don't like the GAME. And if they think the consumer base doesn't like the game they'll never make another Dragon's Dogma title. Why? Because reviews affect sales numbers. Sales numbers influence whether or not another entry to the series will ever happen.Capcom's only love language is money. If the game itself sells well and gets rave reviews then they'll make another one. If the MTX never sells they'll be less likely to include them in future entries. Or, at the very least, they'll include fewer of them to see if they can get away with just a handful. And if those also don't sell they'll eventually give up on them for the title in question.Use your heads and speak with your wallets, people.Buy the game and review it ON ITS OWN MERITS, and don't buy the MTX.THAT is how we send the message to Capcom about how to continue with the development of their future titles. Down voting an otherwise great game because there are MTX only tells them that the game itself is non-viable for their profit margins, and they'll stop trying to make future entries for it.Thanks to the mass negative reviews I fully expect this to be the second and FINAL entry in the IP.Thanks for that, everyone. You've killed an otherwise great IP's chance for a future because you couldn't help but use the review system to b*tch at Capcom in a destructive way.-MTX Rant Over -As a game, Dragon's Dogma 2 is beautiful, engaging, and challenging.Yes, it has some performance issues and needs to be better optimized. But that's well within Capcom's ability to fix with some patches and updates. I'm not worried about that.The game's single save file is the only thing I truly don't like about it. It's long been standard for multiple save files to be present in the video game landscape. And while I can understand they wanted to challenge the player and give them a reason to replay the game and do the quests they missed out on in their first play through, I, as a player, want to have control over that aspect of my own gaming experience. The time of a single save file has long since past. And it's time for Capcom to let go of that antiquated line of thinking.Empower the player, Capcom. The more you restrict or intrude upon our experience the more we'll turn against you. And you're already seeing the evidence of that in the review bombing because you had the gall to include MTX in a single-player title which has no business implementing them in the first place.This game is far more challenging than its predecessor. The abundance of enemies and creatures in the world keeps you on your toes and can very quickly lead to your death if you're not careful. More than once I was fighting a goblin group before stumbling into a Cyclops and getting utterly decimated by the tag-team.The pawns are just as talkative as ever. But at least this time they have a bit more variety in their chatter than last time. It's still a tad annoying at times. But another element that helps offset it is the interactivity between them. They never spoke with each other before. Now, they do. And it's refreshing and somewhat entertaining at times.The equipment and weapons system is basically identical to the original game. And as a player of the original title from its initial launch I feel right at home from the get-go. The addition of so many ingredient items and the ease with which you can attain them is a welcome change as well. The original game was a bit less forgiving with the foraging and drop rates than this title is. Or, at least that's been my experience so far.Since I've only played about 10.5 hours I know there's a lot left to experience. But I'm greatly looking forward to it. Despite the slight performance drops in the big city areas (which honestly hasn't been that bad for me) the overall game itself has been a treat to play and makes me feel like I'm playing a natural continuation of the original title. I have to applaud Capcom for the consistency in the aesthetics, the atmosphere and vibe of the game in general, and the way they've managed to maintain all the most important and useful elements of the original while giving subtle but nonetheless important updates/upgrades.I do hope Capcom gets the message about the MTX and doesn't include them in future titles. They're unwelcome and unnecessary. But because people keep buying them they keep including them.The player base has the power to shape the MTX landscape by not buying. Let the few whales out there waste their money on that garbage. Save your money. Buy the game. Don't buy the MTX. Send the message with your wallet that the game is welcome and necessary, but the MTX aren't.Be smart.Don't be a vocal but unhelpful review bomber. Doing that kills the IP faster than it reshapes the MTX landscape.Thanks.",1

Positive,"Dragon's Dogma 2 is like ordering your favorite pizza but with extra toppings you didn t even know you wanted. The combat is still as deliciously chaotic as ever climbing on a cyclops' back while your pawn shouts wildly obvious advice never gets old. The world is gorgeous, even if some textures look like they re from a decade ago, but who cares when you're dodging fireballs and being chased by griffins at night (seriously, don't travel at night, it s a death wish). The pawns are smarter, which is great unless you enjoyed watching them dive into traps with the enthusiasm of a toddler chasing a butterfly. The story? Eh, it's serviceable just don t expect Game of Thrones level intrigue. It s really all about the journey: monster fights, epic vistas, and managing your weight limit like you're playing inventory Tetris. Overall, it s an adrenaline-packed adventure where the occasional jank is part of the charm.",1
Positive,This game is being hold back from greatness by 2 things in my opinion. First is optimization. The game runs well in the wild with a few exception's of stuttering. The moment you reach a city it just feels awful. The cities are very good looking but because of the bad city optimization i just buy my item's and leave ASAP. The second thing holding this game back is skill slot's. The game-play for the first 20-30 hours is fun but since you are stuck with only 4 skill slot's it can get repetitive after a while. I thought unlocking the warfarer would make the game more fun but it sucks in general. It went from jack of all trades to jack of some trades( being limited to only 3 skills across the board ). So at the end of the day even if you are a fan of Dragon's Dogma i would wait a couple of weeks for bugs and optimization to be fixed before buying.P.S- My most fun classes would be either thief or mystic spearhandP.S.S- RIP strider class( i thought warfarer would have been able to do you justice but i was wrong),1
Positive,"Finished the game with all achievements. Imma keep it simple. - Bad (high priority in task manager/Process Lasso helps a bit) - Meh - Satisfying - Satisfying - Satisfying (""Look how many women we count among our number!"") - Unnecessary (probably added to fulfil a shareholder requirement) - Feels like a regression (QoL) in some parts while it is improved in others (graphics, combat) - Not included, automatic 0/10 Yes but only if you wait for a sale and patches that improve performance.Otherwise no.If you want to mod, please have basic reading comprehension.",1
Positive,"I enjoyed the first game immensely. This one's just like it but with improved. well, just about everything. The story is short, but that doesn't matter. the combat system is where it's at. I've played through about 4 times since the day it came out, and will sometimes just restart anew to enjoy the challenge of the combat. Once you get to a certain level or beat the game, the enemy difficulty does not rise. It's not a perfect game. but what it DOES RIGHT, it does right better than any other game I've ever seen in this genre. So it owns me. and flaws and all, it was worth every penny and then some.",1
Positive,"As a preface, if you have not played DD:DA, you might be better off getting it for $4 and waiting for DD2 to get optimized and/or on sale.Lots of fun, exactly what I've been missing for years. Played the shit out of DD(:DA) on PS3, for sure will play the shit out of this one. They delivered on the front of keeping it Dragon's Dogma.Performance is rightly criticised, especially in the city. Playing on Linux (working day one!), on (is it considered budget build now?) 3700X and 6700XT, 20-45 fps in the city, but 60 with some dips to 50 in open world. Perfectly playable, but not something to be settled with/accepted. Sincerely hope they give it their all in optimization, otherwise it doesn't bode well for MH Wilds and future of RE Engine in general.The amount of shit if gets for other things is quite baffling, took a peek at some popular streamers and found it ridiculous. Some kept saying you can only use fast travel or make a new character by paying, one even claimed (to his 10k+ viewers) you can't manually save and somehow people believed it. If they don't make it up on the fly to ride the (deserved) performance issues related hate train then I feel bad for their regular viewers.Might be controversial, but people are blowing microtransactions out of proportions. They are a complete waste of money since you can get all actually useful items in-game (yet somehow it clearly works since Capcom keeps adding this kind of mtx in their games). I don't buy mtx, find them bad in general, but if you get milked buying this, quite frankly you deserve it.",1
Positive,"I was happy to hear when this game released because I adored the first game. But I waited long before I actually bought the game, because of the mixed review, high pricetag and performance issues.After a few months I decided to buy it and give it a go. I think the latest patch helped a bit with the performance, but my pc was still struggling.I love the exploration and vocations in the game. You can freely unlock and just switch the vocations in and out on a whim. The combat and controls improved a lot compared to the first game on pc. It feels a lot smoother.The pawns got more intelligent as well, and I think they are more helpful. Their chatter has more variety as well.Talking about variety, there are not a lot of enemies in the game. It becomes very apparent since there is not a lot of fast travel available, and you encounter the same enemies over and over. At the last bit of the game it became too boring to me.Story is pretty bad as well. The pacing is strange, and it's a lot of walking back and forth. I missed feeling the impact in the story. I don't know. I enjoyed playing the game, but there are also a lot of things lacking. I would slightly recommend Dragon's Dogma 2, but definitely not for the 70 euro pricetag. Get it on a steep sale if you are curious. Also note that the micro transactions here and from the in-game store are definitely not needed. You can get all items listed without hassle in the game through normal gameplay.",1
Positive,"20 hours is probably enough to forge a decent opinion. The complaining isn't unwarranted - the story is a bit washy, and it would have been nice to have some more enemy variety. It has the same hang-ups as DD1 (and the same jank sometimes).However, the performance of the game is in a much better place than older reviews would have you believe. The game looks stunning at time, and whilst I get some dips in hectic fight, its smooth enough and I haven't had any crashing issues. Its much better come this October patch.The combat feels excellent, some wonky camera issues aside. Theres something unique with DDs monster system in the way that you can fight a griffon, only for 2 cyclops to show up and throw an ox at you. The lack of fast travel ease helps this making journeys feel hard and ardous, in a good way. There are carts that ferry you back and forth once you've established a route. The casual mode is the normal game but you have more stamina, inns dont cost your life savings, and dragonsplague is a non-issue. Would advise it if you want a more fun game but with the same difficulty. Things will still one tap you on this mode (and its good to see).DD1 is hard to beat in terms of fun - but the story was awful, it looked visually dated, and pawns were annoying. DD2s story is (pretty) awful, it looks visually stunning, and pawns are annoying. Gameplays much better though. The camping miniscene has photorealistic meat for some reason. So far - a good 7, maybe 8 out of 10. Pick it up on sale for sure, no qualms that price. For 55? Little mental (but hey, thats the price of games now it seems)",1
Positive,"It's just DD1 . but better! Also protip: don't buy any of the microtransactions, ALL of those items are readily available in-game.About performance: DD2 is a very CPU-heavy game it seems, try going to Task Manager -> Details -> find DD2 and set priority to High. Anecdotal reports say you can gain anywhere from 10 fps to double or triple fps in the city areas.",1

Positive,"I haven't played DD1 and went into this blind. Was a bit sceptical at first since most reviewers said it was lacking in story or enemy variety etc. But this game honestly blew me away. The story elements are allright, if not just an excuse to get you there and explore. Because that's what this game is all about; exploring and monster slaying at mach speed. It's also nice to come back to town just to relax and do some light fetch or delivery quests. The environments are handcrafted to perfection and it's many inhabitants make this world come alive. I have to keep reminding myself to stop exploring after a while because my health goes lower and supplies are running thin. You almost never end up just going from A to B when on a quest. Exploring almost always rewards you in some way. Highly addictive! Don't go into this expecting BG3 levels of campaign. Instead enjoy the ride. Go wherever you heart takes you, because fun is guaranteed to be had just around the next corner!",1
Positive,"I'll be blunt and say it. The story in this game is atrociously bad. The dialogue, the story itself, the way the events unfold, it's all terrible, and the lead-up to the final boss fight is probably one of the worst I've ever seen in any game. This game has horrible FPS problems months after launch, however it does seem like setting the program priority to ""High"" and playing in fullscreen helps quite a bit on my 2070. And that's everything bad about the game, literally everything else is phenomenal. The graphics are great, I love the artstyle, character customization is good, class variety is certainly far from lacking. I mean, the playstyles you can get out of this game alone, not even considering the world design or insanely fun combat. While this game has its flaws, if you can look past the bad story and FPS, this game truly is a hidden gem. My God is this game fun, there's nothing more entertaining than climbing on a dragon's back as it flies hundreds of feet up into the sky just to shake you off and have you fall to your death. Despite its issues, I think Dragon's Dogma 2 is a fantastic game and if you're a fan of RPGs, (and if you can ignore the bad story) I'm sure you'll love this game too. PS: Ignore all the people talking about microtransactions, everything sold is VERY EASILY earned in-game by simply playing. The microtransactions are there for truly lazy gamers or people that are easily tricked/scammed.",1
Positive,"Dragon's Dogma 2 embraces the quirks that made the first game one of my favorites, and I highly recommend picking this one up. Its feels awesome picking up small foes and chucking them off cliffs, the pawns congratulating you on well done kills, climbing gigantic ogres and planting charges on their face to detonate, and clinging on the backs of griffons to make the trip to nests to loot. Some notes:1. If you didn't like the first game, I don't think you'll like this one. Its everything that game was. 2. Performance issues: The frame rates in town can vary quite significantly. They're not as terrible as folks online whine about, but its not great either. There are ways to reduce this (like limiting your frame rate from the 120fps you don't really need to 75/60 so the drops don't drop as much). I've had no crashes, or any weird bugs yet. The randomly spawning villagers laughable. They should probably work on that.3. You should use a controller. Keyboard and mouse are passable. Barely. Just. Use. A. Controller. Sit back. Relax a little.4. The micro-transactions are eye-rolling. None of them are necessary, all of them can be earned in game should you want, and modders have already created a way to spawn any of them you want to get super quickly. Don't buy them. If you're thinking about buying them, please don't. Rewarding this sort of micro-transaction just means we shall continue to get more. Its definitely a publisher call over a developer one.",1
Positive,"We have a Sphinx Mommy in the game, if i could give eternal bond for her, i would FR. Whoever was behind her, is a true champ, she gets aggroed if you grab the big milkers, she flees if you hit her face aka ruins her skincare. Best boss in the game hands down.So this game followed the footstep of the first game, in some aspects this game is an improvement, in other aspects this game is a let down. At least for me, the good traits of the game, are bigger than the downsides. Exploration of the game was solid one of the best i had since i've played skyrim for the first time, it was genuinely fun exploring the biomas, fighting the ambushes, and getting to random places with nice loots, i changed pawns very often, and the improvement in the AI of the pawns and the enemies was really nice.The story itself isnt linked for the first game, and in fact is better explained in this game, theres a lot of dialogues which explains from the beginning to the end of the ""why are you doing this in the first place?"" You may in fact dislike the end of the game for example, but the writing itself was an improvement of the first game Dragons Dogma. Combat wise. You have some hidden mechanics such as Medusa head being a hitkill weapon accessory to any enemy in the game. (Its forsaken normal enemies loots, but faster XP farming GO BRRRRRRR) ok, you want that sweet loot? Use mystic archer maister skill, it one shot most enemies in the game. YET what i had the most fun, was the jedi Spearhand, you literally fight like a Jedi in Dragons dogma with that! haahaha. (and my fav class was warfarer, DRIP check with any weapon)PSA: Hire a pawn mage with celestial Peon, it's the best support skill in the game, i think its legit the best skill any team pawn could have. - Denuvo. Enough said about that.- MTX are totally optional, doesnt impact the gameplay, its for lazy gamer cheat feature, Capcom is doing this since DMC5 doesnt warrant a negative review in my opinion, as everything they sold as DLC you get in the game, i had literally 7 Fast Travel portcrystal, and 40 ferrystone in my run. So dont waste your money in rubbish- I got the deluxe edition due to the OST, DD2 ost is fine, ending song was beatiful, but the general ost of the game i found worse than the first game, i switched BGM to the original game and i had a blast playing the game, feel a bit sad due to only liking 2 BGM of DD2. IT is, what it is. - In dragons dogma 1, we had around 6-8 skills avaible to use, in Dragons 2 every class only has 4 slots. this was a downgrade, a massive one at that, luckily the mod saints of nexus made a mod which unlocks 8 skills slots for the Arisen. (i genuinely wish this game gets an update for that and DEVS change to 8 skill slots, cause gameplay became repetitive if you use BIG DPS skills, theres some skills which doesnt do a lot of Damage, but like you could run with a greatsword and impale at the wall a big fatass Lizard and that was DOPE AF)- I have a strong issue about the fashion in the game. I've beaten the game with warrior gear, the best armors i could find without spending WC crystals are legit underwear as armors, I literally beat the game with two skimp outfits cause they had better stats than fullplate armor, mind ya, it was somewhat funny seeing my 6' feet tall Arisen with a leather underpants smashing a dragon. I was legit like "" KEK "", Not to speak about my pawn, being useful af as a warrior or an archer, but i'm planning to change her to archer, cause the clothes arent so skimpy. (endgame gear).",1
Positive,"Some short thoughts:Capcom's greediness and game's wonky perfomance aside, devs really worked hard to make the game feel like first one but better. And first was really fun as well. Story felt more like a soft reboot than a sequel, which is a bit shame. But all that silliness is still there, which I love (reminds me a bit of Oblivion).Combat is amazing. I'm surprised how they managed to make even most basic sounding classes fun to play (sword and shield, yay. :) Climbing enemies and obstacles like walls and cliff sides should be standard mechanic in every RPG by now. Although for some reason climbing on walls was more restrictive in this game than in first.Pawns are better than ever. They still talk a lot, which some may find annoying, but it is less than in first. They feel helpful and I like seeing terrifying creations people have made. If someone gifts your pawn rotten food, that might mean something is wrong ;)Exploration feels great. I just kept sidetracking all the time for every nook and cranny. They made a great effort to reward you wherever you went in a world.Quests were story wise mostly fine. Quality did jump around a bit, but nothing too bad. I did like how open many of them felt. Game doesn't tell you every answer and show you where you need to go. You need to use your own noggin a lot more, which was a nice change of pace.Overall very unique and amazing RPG. Best one I have played in years and will definitely continue playing for a long time. Let's just hope Capcom gives it every support it needs to fix the perfomance.",1
Positive,"You do NOT have to spend 1.99 to change the look of your character.You spend 500 RC (Which you get from killing monsters or pawn-related things) at the pawn guild vendor to get an item that you bring to the barber, who gives you the option to change your appearance with it. Yes, change anything about your character.I don't agree with the MTX. I hate the performance issues. And it's scummy for them to just drop all this MTX without mentioning it before. But reviewers are wrong about the 1.99 appearance change.- I am editing this to add more context now that I've played more of the game, and have seen that the comments on this absolutely blew up. And I never apologized for anything. People calling me an apologist after I said I don't agree with the MTX? These are the people you don't need to be listening to. Critical thought and nuance is not in their capabilities.Came back like 24 hours later and saw this blow up. Jesus christ, people. Let me clear some things. And because this got nearly 300 comments in under a day, idk if I'll read any responses, cause I got Horizon FW, this game, South Park Snow Day, and Helldivers 2 to play.1: I still enjoy the game. I have not and will not spend a dime on the microtransactions. If it wasn't for Steam listing it on the library page when you go to launch the game, you would not know MTX were even in this game. There are 0 indicators in the entire game that there are any microtransactions. I can support the game without supporting MTX by simple not buying the MTX. This is an extremely basic level of nuance that any sensible person can understand. If you can't understand it, then you're not being sensible.2: The performance is probably the thing that pisses me off the most. I played Jedi Survivor and was heart broken at it's performance. However, this is better than Jedi Survivor. If you get into a town, you'll get drops. But you'll rarely ever get into a fight in a town. And if you do, you can just run away.3: This game is likely founded on the same principle that DD1 was: They want you to run New Game Plus. That might be why they thought you didn't need several saves, because you would just keep running the game over and over. Animal Crossing did the same thing with only one save on the ENTIRE SWITCH, and yet didn't receive a fraction of this outrage. I'm not excusing it, but this one doesn't affect me at all, so I'm not going to sit here and say I'm outraged by it, because I'd be lying. It just doesn't affect me, or my experience.4: Since people are REALLY confused as to why I still put positive review, I'll mention the things I like. I'm loving the combat (obviously. I'm a DD:DA fan), and I've already maxed out Mystic Spearhand along with getting it's master vocational skill. I've also played a lot of the other vocations, and each one plays differently and uses different strategies. I absolutely LOVE that you can grab the legs of monsters and push them off balance, and your pawns will come up to help you push. There's a bunch of cool added features like that in the combat. Quite simply: If you enjoyed DD:DA's combat, you're gonna love this one's combat. The performance issues really aren't a problem outside of towns/NPC heavy locations. But I'm running a 3080ti and 5800x. So while I don't have top hardware, the game still runs perfectly fine at mostly maxed out settings (With DLSS on quality and RT on) outside of NPC-heavy locations. Even when I'm fighting a dragon and an ogre at the same time, the frames are flawless.Last note: I agree Capcom needs to do better. But I had all of this rage that you all are showing LAST YEAR WHEN HOGWARTS LEGACY AND JEDI SURVIVOR LAUNCHED TO ABSOLUTE DOG SHIT PERFORMANCE ISSUES, but none of you cared enough to make the scene you're making now, and they didn't care to fix them. THAT was the time to make this an issue out of the industry, but you all slept. So I'm not riding the rage-wagon anymore. I'm just enjoying the gameplay.Oh, also: I didn't say that it doesn't have a 1.99 appearance change DLC. I just said you don't have to buy it to change your appearance. But some people having reading problems I guess.",1
Positive,"If you enjoyed the first game, you will love this one. They have taken everything the first game did well and improved upon it. That being said, there are still some issues with the game. When you enters large cities such as Vernworth, you will lose frames. I consistently drop from 60fps to 30fps within Vernworth. I have seen many creators say this is a memory leak issue that can easily be patched later, but I am unsure of the truth of that claim. In regards to the micro-transactions: It is unfortunate that they exist, however, every item apart from the character edit item is extremely easy to obtain in game. By simply walking around with pawns you will receive wakestones. You can find port-crystals throughout the game, and they respawn in new game+, allowing you to place one at every location you could ever want to travel to. The game-play is top-notch just like the first game. It has exciting combat, fun to fight monsters, and the pawn system is extremely fun to use. If the fps issues are a deal-breaker for you, I would wait a while before buying the game to see if they fix it. But the items you can buy through micro-transactions are entirely unnecessary and you are wasting your money if you buy them. If you are worried about messing up how your character looks, download the free character creation tool and spend as much time as you want perfecting it. The character and pawn you make there carry over to the game. If you are worried about choosing the wrong class, don't be, because you are meant to try out every class and you can swap at vocation guilds. TL;DR: Game-play is great, there are some fps issues that need to be fixed, the micro-transactions suck, but all the items you can buy with them are unnecessary to the game.Edit: I have now beaten this game twice and achieved both endings. Here are my final and updated thoughts on Dragon's Dogma 2. I still think the game-play is great. I still think the micro-transactions are annoying, but a non-issue. What I mainly want to talk about are where DD2 fails to live up to its predecessor. DD:DA (DD1) was one of my favorite games of all time because of its amazing combat, difficulty, and replay-ability. While DD2 keeps this great game-play, it has lost both the difficulty and the replay-ability that made the first game so near and dear to my heart. First I would like to talk about difficulty. Plainly put this game is incredibly easy if you played the first game. When you get the true ending, it shows you some statistics from your play-through. Times died is one of them. I died a grand total of one time in my current 35 hours of game-play. This death also was not while fighting, but it came from fall damage when I was running around at night without paying attention. All bosses, including the final boss fight with The Dragon are disappointingly easy. Even before I went into new game+, I got to The Dragon for the first time, and my sorcerer pawn cast a single spell to kill her. The second time I killed him in two thief skills. It was a major letdown. The poor replay-ability ties in with the difficulty. There is no bonus content to do upon new game+. The monsters do not get harder, nor are there new monsters to fight, which would be my preferred fix. You just replay the game a second time. Now, this is how a lot of games' new game+ work, so what's the problem here? The terrible story. I was never expecting a marvel of writing when it came to the story telling of this game. The first game's story was told poorly too. The difference is that, beneath the bad portrayal of it, the first Dragon's Dogma had a super interesting story. You just had to do some digging to uncover it, sort of like how there are hundreds if not thousands of lore videos on the Souls series. There is nothing extra really going on in DD2. The story is what it is, and it's bad. My first play-through took me twenty hours to complete. but I could have done it much faster if I had not grinded to get every vocation and get several to max rank. I think I could have finished the game in as little as fifteen hours. That is incredibly short. The worst part is how much the story falls off. The story in the beginning of the game, in Vernworth, is not great, but it's trying. Once you are told to leave for Battahl, the story is essentially over. You only do one quest for the city of Battahl, and then you fuck off to go do random shit in the world. Overall, I still like this game. I don't regret spending my money on it. But know that this game is worse than the first game, and is therefore a disappointment considering Itsuno hyped this as, ""What the first game was supposed to be.""",1
Positive,"Okay. I wasn't going to post a review originally, but I feel that this hate train has gone on long enough, so I'm throwing my two cents in not for the people who are convinced they hate the game already, but for those who look at the countless negative reviews and wonder what in the world is going on. I'm going to try and be as unbiased as I possibly can here and weather you want to take what I say to heart or throw it all in the trash is on you. I also don't do TL:DRs. You've been warned.I've spent a little over 800 hours in this game. Gone through about 6 and a half playthroughs with the main goal of getting all the gear I felt I would want before I stopped, and first I want to say that I enjoyed it. Did I enjoy everything? No. Just like every game in existence and every future game, it has it's problems. People need to understand that first and foremost before going on a smear campaign for months on end, complaining about the same things, some them being just plain silly and most likely started by whiny Keyboard Warriors with nothing else to do but tell everyone else what to do with their money and if you disagree with anything they say then you're just dumb. I just want to say, don't let anyone tell you what to do with your own money, and don't believe everything you hear on the internet. That goes for this review as well. Take what everyone says with a grain of salt. Take people's opinions into consideration, but the ultimate decision is yours. Don't be a sheep and blindly follow what people tell you. With that said, let's begin.Let's start with the price. One of the main hot topics. I don't think anyone can deny that this game is pretty darn expensive, but the real question is, is it worth it? Well, from the hours and repeated playthroughs I have put into this game. At full price.? Honestly no. I don't think it's worth it. At 15-25% off I would say it's fine. But, even though I like the game enough to sink a lot of hours into it. There just isn't enough here to warrant full price. I say wait for a sale with the aforementioned discount if you have the patience. For the people who say they won't buy the game for more then $30. All I can say is, have fun waiting a few years. Might as well just forget about the game all together at that point if you're going that far because that's just not realistic when the game is only a few months old at the time of writing this review. Despite what people want you to think, the game sold very well and Capcom has no reason to lower it so low.Another thing that has been disputed time and time again is the performance of the game. It's been talked about so much that I'm frankly sick of it at this point. Is it that much of a problem? Honestly it depends on who you ask and what kind of rig they have. Everyone is different. Some people won't play a game that can't at least hit 60FPS which is fine. Some people won't play a game unless they can run it with unlimited frames which is also fine. Still others straight up can't get the game to run at all which is not fine. And others (like myself) can't get it to run more than 30 FPS. Everyone is different, but I'll say that on my end, I still enjoyed my time with it despite the 30FPS. This isn't the first game I've played with bad frame rate. I like to see myself as a patient man, and the game was playable enough for me to 100% the game. So the frame rate didn't make the game ""unplayable"". Of course it was not the best it could be, but it was playable enough to be fun. I know not everyone will think that way but to each their own.There's more I could talk about but this review has gone on long enough. I'm just tired of hearing complaints from entitled people who expect every game to be flawless at launch every time. So yeah, don't be apart of the hate train please. Especially if you don't even have the game for goodness sake. Also take a good hard look before you judge something, or just have a little patience before you go slinging around hate. I just hope this review makes a least one person take a step back and reevaluate things.",1
Positive,"The game is super fun, the visuals are awesome, and the combat is great. The only problem is the FPS drops.Now, where are my skimpy pants?Masterpiece 10/10",1
Positive,"For better, and for worse, Dragon's Dogma 2 is a faithful sequel to its predecessor.It has taken after seemingly everything the first game did lay out, good and bad, may it be design decisions or corporate not giving it enough room to breathe !It's a refined, somewhat streamlined, maybe even simplified version of the first game's combat system, making for a different experience, but a more accessible one. You'll turn out a game plan for all the vocations you pick up pretty quickly, and there's basically no overlap between what all the vocations are capable/meant to do. The loop is, by my definition, pretty fun ! May it be dispatching the game's abundance of goblin or saurian chaff, or tackling the larger members of the game's bestiary, unfortunately their placement across the game world is mismanaged, and it may lead to a nagging feeling of repetitiveness in the later parts of a playthrough.The pawns ! They are great, both stupid and smart, capable of triumphant success and bitter failure, they will be the source of both your highest and lowest moments in the game in equal measure. They will comment about every little thing and attempt, numerous times, to guide you to your next destination, or a chest they happened to find while exploring other worlds beyond the Rift. I would like to dedicate this review to the pawn Adam Sandler. If his creator ever reads this, godspeed.The story is as anecdotal as it once was. It is a mishmash of unexplored ideas, unfinished story beats and hollow characters, that will inevitably lead to a feeling of disappointment, as for many players, the credits will roll and I suspect they'll be thinking ""That's it ?"". The pacing is poorly handled, with the later half of the game feeling like a summary of events rather than a well told middle and end to the game's narrative, with a high probability that players will MISS OUT on a VERY MEANINGFUL chunk of the game.Visually, the characters and enemies are modeled and animated beautifully, the landscapes are gorgeous and traversing the world is a genuinely pleasing experience, weapon swings will feel light or weighty as they require and the feedback from connecting weapons skills or finishers is very satisfying.The game's sound design and music are also phenomenal, I will miss Dark Arisen's main menu theme, but aside from that, the music accompanying you during either exploration or combat are very well composed and the sound effects punctuating fights also add to the previously mentioned feedback, further enhancing combat as a whole.From a technical standpoint, the game bears many faults, performance and stability issues have been mentioned numerous times, rightfully, I personally have only struggled with dropping frame rates in particularly dense environments, and while I've only ever crashed once in 141 hours of playtime, I've slipped under geometry a couple times, a very harrowing experience. I am not too sensible to performance issues, but it may heavily hinder your enjoyment of the game, it definitely deserved more time to simmer and I hope we will eventually get a more stable and better performing version later (not too late) into its lifespan, so as to allow for a greater amount of people to play the game !The micro-transactions topic has been done and done, NONE of the content being sold to you is exclusive to the digital storefront, it is all obtainable in-game, with minimal effort, you are paying to go fast, not paying to play or to win. That being said, I would like to highlight, I do not condone the addition of the redundant micro-transactions, they only brought bad PR, for nothing.I would like to believe it is a clause they need to be added per the executive decision of some corporate goon and it was decided to pick the lesser of all possible evils. In the game, they are not intrusive in the slightest and not once would it come to my mind to QUIT OUT of the game to purchase any of the items sold, but they already tarnished the game in many people's eyes, pointlessly.In conclusion, unfortunately and like many, many games, Dragon's Dogma 2 is not perfect, in the current sorry state of the industry, it has come out as on par with its peers, hastily released, and very much owed at least another 6 months in the competent hands of developers, unspoiled by greed. In spite of that, it is really really fun, tarred as the frame rates may sometimes be, the joy it brings me to sink a sword of dragon slaying proportions into the nearest living creature, or toppling a great beast many, many times my size is simply too great.My god please give us a slider for the FOV, I am begging on my KNEES.",1
Positive,"A series that I always wished to get into, after my initial 25h playthrough, the last time I tried to play DD1 was right after a date was announced for DD2, and when I inevitably dropped the prequel again, needless to say, I was not holding my breath for the sequel.Still, I came across the advertising on socials and could see the huge hype the community had for it, and when the Character Creator Demo was released, I obviously had to try and make my beloved characters.Regardless of my history with the series, this sparked my interest, but what really put the nail in the coffin was the gameranx Before You Buy video, where he compared exploring in DD2 to Elden Ring.The story revolves around the main character, the Arisen, chosen directly by the Dragon who steals its heart binding the two together.The Arisen has then the objective to become inhumanly powerful to challenge the Dragon, win its heart back, and save the world, with the help of human-looking immortal otherworldly beings known as pawns, that respond exclusively to the Arisen.As long as the dragon lives, the Arisen cannot die.The main pawn of the Arisen can be created freely, while the other two can be hired to have a group of four. The Arisen is not a one-man army and requires the support of a well-made team of pawns to succeed.In the setting of DD2, Arisens are now by default the king of the city of Venworth, yet our journey begins as slaves, after having lost our memory.That being said, the story of the game is not the primary focus and has low roleplayability when it comes to choice-making. The subplots especially in the second half, leave a lot to desire. The ""bigger picture"" of the world does the heavy lifting, being the more interesting part.What DD2 does amazingly, is feel like a breathing world with a plethora of NPCs that can give quests, often responding to our actions. The Vermundian Forest and the Batthali Desert are the 2 biomes available with cities and occasional new structures or areas in some specific parts of the map.Besides fighting, questing, and the 240 collectibles around the map, caves/dungeons are one of the few activities available in the open world. These can be as small as a few rooms, to medium-sized, but usually share the same style and design.The enemies' variety, although fun to fight against, is almost identical to DD1, making it blatant that, ignoring re-skinned variants, there are roughly 20 enemy types in total, including bosses. This lack of variety is extended to loot, with some chests rewarding equipment, but many offering consumables.All this is somewhat aggravated by the constant barrage of enemies the player has to fight, to the point of making one of the alternatives to foot travel, hard to use.The first time I took one of the carts that go by the main roads I wanted to sit and enjoy the whole trip, instead of taking a nap. We were attacked 5 times back to back and the cart was destroyed for taking too much damage.Moreover, these carts although not supposed to travel by night in the lore, some travels are so long that if awoken, it'll be night. A simple fix for an immersion-breaking mistake.Like in the aforementioned example, the beautiful and dynamic world of DD2 does not communicate to the player its lore with its design, enemy placement, or loot. There is often no special reason behind why a certain group of enemies is there, or why that greatsword was in that cave, instead, the world is simply where everything happens. One of the design points that is both controversial and well-known in the series, is that fast travel is not easily accessible, by design. The creator believes that fast travel is a crutch for a bad world design and that it's a reflection of a boring world.I could not disagree more.While yes, fast travel can be a crutch to a less interesting world design, providing that commodity does not make the world less interesting by default.Forcing the player to walk everywhere and constantly fight enemies didn't incentivize me to explore every corner, just like Elden Ring's fast travel did not deter me from it.Where in Elden Ring I found myself going from A to B, having as the incentive the much more varied world, loot, enemies, etc. in between, in DD2, it's how dynamic the experience of going toward B that motivated me, because what happens during the travel often counts more than the destination.This game shines in its combat system and the interactivity that it offers. Vocations, or classes, can be changed on a whim at no cost and completely change the fighting approach complimented by amazing animations.Vocations have their own weapon, with a starting moveset just as complex as any From Software game. These level up only when using them, and unlock both core abilities, active abilities - basically 4 additional weapon skills, and passive abilities - that can be used on any vocation.I started the game as a fighter using a sword and shield and later moved to the warrior with a two-handed greatsword. By the time I unlocked the magic warrior with a twin spear, my mind was set to only level up the vocations that I was interested in. When I noticed that my main pawn as an archer had unlocked a passive to deal more damage to weak points, I changed my mind and decided to level all of them.One of the core abilities of a fighter is to absorb fall damage by landing on the shield. Right after changing back to this vocation a griffin attacked near the town's exit, and during the fight tried to fly away while I was on its back. I proceeded to attack it until we both fell from the sky, but the griffin being bigger fell faster, so with my death impending, I remembered I could land on my shield to hopefully dampen my fall, which was funnily right on its head, dealing a lot of damage.Another highlight was how at some point I was exploring a part of the map and noticed that where I wanted to go was inaccessible to me because of a high cliff. From the near high ground, I then noticed a cyclop was sleeping not too far from the edge of the cliff. Since I was playing archer, I hit it at a distance to lure it closer, and once weakened it, pushed it against the wall of the cliff, climbed on its back, and used its height as a way to reach the top of this cliff.All these interactions happened not because they were scripted but simply because different systems in the game worked together. If you think you can do it, you likely can, and that's the real magic of this game.A lot of rightful noise was made at the game's release because of microtransactions and PC performances, and don't get me wrong, I denounce both.Not to be devil's advocate, but when it comes to microtransactions, while it's disgusting they included them, it is of the lesser ugly of sorts, with items that are easily accessible and available in-game. Even rift crystals used to hire pawns are readily available, and useless since hiring current-level pawns is free.Just like for other recent Capcom releases, it's mostly a scam to less savvy players.Stunning as it might be, the PC port runs poorly and even with my hardware, I had to fall back on DLSS Frame Generation to have a stable frame time inside the city and avoid VRR flicker. The game's graphic options do little to nothing for performance gains, with a major visual impact.For a sequel, the title builds on the already solid gameplay base of DD1 and adds some, resulting in a magical gaming experience that I won't forget and motivates me to play the prequel and to keep playing. Although flawed, the game stands as a unique experience; one that I strongly suggest.9.8/10",1
Positive,overall enjoyed my time on this game i wish the main story was a little bit longer though.,1
Positive,"No clue what people expected from this game? I have nearly 60 hours as of writing this review, and im still finishing quests in my first play through. I've never ran into a bug as of yet. I thought I did once, an NPC was missing, but turns out he died and was in a casket at the morgue.Just had to revive him. I don't remember the last Dragons Dogma having a particularly compelling story either, these games are more about the adventure and combat. Which in DD2, fantastic. I play at 4k maxed out settings locked at 100FPS using DLSS and Frame Gen. Even in Vernsworth it's locked 100fps. (4080/7800x3D). I also saw people complaining about barely any fast travel? You can see how many ferrystones you use in the adventure log.I have 32 ferrystones in my storage and have fast traveled a total of 61 times in my 58 hours of playtime. I've not bought a single MTX item, and frankly, I forgot that this game even has MTX. Looking at the list now it's all worthless to even buy. If you're looking for a game that you can get so many hours of combat and exploration, I recommend this one just like I did DD:DA. They're both fantastic games. I can't wait for an expansion DLC and hard mode in the future.",1
Positive,"15 Hours in, mid-range PC, mid settings. first crash, 30 fps in town, solid 60 outside of town, could be higher if i lowered some settings. having a blast. micro transactions r completely redundant since u can get it in-game easy. don't let people dissuade u from trying this game if u like the combat etc.",1
Positive,"I wanna start by saying that hiding microtransactions till release, then acting like we're the ones with the problem in their reply to the community is a real crappy way to build PR. I also had a crash on checking my map in the first main city. THAT SAID, there is a great game here which took all I loved about DD1 and just improved it. I really wished there was a ""maybe"" reccommend option on steam. I reccommend it, on the caveat that Capcom get their sh*t together, fix the game and maybe not lie/hide stuff from their community.",1
Positive,"Will update this as i GoPros:Combat mechanics and animations related to combat are flawless, everything flows into each strike and bash. The fact that there is multiple ways to get a cyclops to fall over rather then just powershotting its feet is great!Enemies have a good vareity, goblins in groups have diffrent purposes, they arent all the same.The world is large and feels alive.Stort so far is good and im itching to go back in.Cons:Edit 1: as much as i love the combat and the world of dragons dogma, The game is a tad bit Short in terms of actual content, End fight with grigori was sadly my biggest let down of the entire game. The Main dragons of the game, the mascot is flat and bland and gets no real buildup. Itsuno what the ACTUAL F*CK. you made him worse than in the original. Unmoored world was fun thoPerformance is lacking in bigger citys, even on FSR or DLSS, its playable but its a tad bit annyoing dippin below 25fps on a High-end rig.thoughts:I see alot of review that are negative for no real reason other than performance. The Microtransactions are laughable, took my pawn 5h of gametime to get over 10k, you can bearly buy 10k RC in the store. Dogma 1 had it to and you could completely ignore it.Growth curve is subjective, first 3h you could easily feel overwhelmed by something a straw stronger than a normal goblin, 5h in goblins are mince meat. Its a power fantasy not dark souls.",1
Positive,This is one of the most disappointing games I have ever played.This is also one of my favorite games of all time.,1
Positive,My pawn is my best friend. I don't need real life friends anymore.,1
Positive,"A ladder, Arisen!",1
Positive,"I was about to dodge this game due to all the reviews.Limited fast travel unless i buy more for real life money in a 70$ single player game? Thats outrageous!I felt like a pawn when i bought it, how can i spend money on such practices? Do i lack a spine?Long story short it turns out you cant F**king fast travel for reallife money, this might actually be the least impactfull microtransactions i have ever seen. YOU CANT FAST TRAVEL FOR $. I hate myself for believing all these people. With that out of the way the performance is really bad, i am playing on a 1080 and i have to run it in 1280 solution which i dont mind to much but keep that in mind when you dont have a NASA rig. But the game itself is glorious. The combat feels meaty, your enemies fly all over the place when you hit them, your pawns (who talk waaay to much) interact in unique ways for example catching you when an ogre attempts to throw you etc. Truely one of the games where you cant play a session without something memorable happening. I dont regret paying for it and i recommend you to play it IF you liked the first title. It has the exact same spirit but way better.",1
Positive,"You really have to know what you're buying with this. Relevant Cons1. You can make only 1 character 2. You only really have one save on that one character. which might be fucked up. There is a secondary save at inns (backup save), but it's rare you're able to use it. could be 1-2 hours of game play between backups. 3. This game feels like its straight out of 2013. Its wonky, janky, and feels dated in some ways. 4. The game struggles to run at 30 fps in large cities, runs at about 40-50 fps in the world. 5. storyline and all characters are trash. very bad 6. Not a particularly detailed game. not comparable to skyrim etc in terms of little stories to stumble upon/ real sidequests. Pros (why I recommend this) 1. Excellent combat 2. sense of risk and adventure. quests feel like a never ending battle just to make it from one place to the next. 3. sense of progression, the world changes and adapts based on your interactions 4. The Pawns >:) you get a posse of slaves that do your bidding4B. The pawns create dynamic combat experiences and play off one another 5. There aren't other new RPG's at this level so it's this or drag your knuckles playing Starfield All of this assumes that $70 doesn't mean much to you. If you view this as an investment, then no it's probably not worth it at this price point.",1
Positive,"Great RPG fantasy experience with heavily focused on journey and exploration, role play and consequences, also magically chaos and brutal combat.Dragon Dogma 2 offers countless hours of playtime and replayability that eliminating any sense of repetitiveness with some refined good aspect of unusual ideas, uniquenes and eccentricities from previous game. But this also become as double-edged sword that possible to alienate some players, however if you loves the the first game, you shouldn't even begin to hesitate, this is everything that Dragon's Dogma wanted to be back in 2012, massive open world with little of POI indicators, smart AI pawns, and great boss battle combat. There are a lot technical and monetization problems that became concern to some people - My RIG r5 5700x + RTX 4070 ti, 40-50 fps in capital and 80-90 fps in overworld, 2K High DLSS Quality Full slider upscaling.- No Paywall in microtransaction, you can farm RC to buy Art of metamorphosis book to change character appearance and farm gold to buy makeshift gaol key if you are arrested.- No game breaking bug and no single crash in 16 hours playtime, maybe i'm lucky.Its not a perfect game but somehow those technical performance didn t stop me from having a blast and truly immerse myself in massive uncertain open world as Arisen with unforgettable moment and exciting adventure.""They're masterworks, all. You cant't go wrong""",1
Positive,i like the game,1
Positive,"At first I found the save system a bit odd and having pawns jump off cliffs or run into water to their doom really annoying. But I persevered, and began to learn the games mechanics, and got really into playing with the different combat styles. The story is a bit crap, but the combat makes up for it, and I didn't have any game breaking bugs. Performance was pretty good throughout as well. Definitely deserves better than 'Mixed Reviews' on here. 7.5/10",1
Positive,"Mostly I feel many of the critical reviews are whiny. This is a fun game in its own right, and if you liked Dark Arisen or similar games, you'll enjoy this one, too. Do not spend the extra money on the Deluxe Edition. Ever. Regardless of sales. I played through twice, to 100% the game, and enjoyed my time doing so. I waited a regrettably long time to try the Thief vocation which is crazy fun to play and deadly powerful against large enemies (especially those that are completely immune to magic in almost every form). Two things I'll address in case anyone still cares - firstly, the DLC is totally irrelevant and there is no need at all for anyone to spend additional money on it. Everything you can buy you will easily obtain in the game just by playing. Is it shitty that the DLC even exists in the first place? Yes. Should you cry about it and not play the game because of it? I guess that depends on how badly you need a deep cry, but probably not. Secondly, I can't argue with the mention of optimization issues, but rarely did I feel it was so slow as to be unplayable. That said, I have an RTX 4070 and wasn't playing on max settings or anything and 30-45 FPS wasn't uncommon, and yes, it was irritating and I could see, for some, that being ""immersion breaking"" but, perhaps this is just me, I never really believed I was anywhere doing anything other than sitting on my very non-fiction ass playing a very fiction game in the first place. So mildly irritated is all I was. I still rode a goddamn griffin like it was my own personal escort to. well. not where I was hoping to be, but here I am.",1
Positive,"BUY ONLY ON SALE!Now that that's out of the way, the game is alright. If you played the first game then you will be dissapointed by some stuff (less vocations, only 4 spell slots instead of 8, very few new monsters, etc.), but you'll also be pleasantly surprised by some other stuff like the improvements made to the pawn system and how similar it plays to the first game.Starting with the character creator, it's absolutely amazing. The most fleshed out character creator I've seen in ages.The performance in the game is pretty bad, due to the AI requirements the CPU often gets maxed out even when the GPU doesn't and that results in framedrops, especially in big towns (I got R9 5800X3D and 3080 and I go to 50 FPS in the capital, graphics settings don't matter in this case as it is CPU hogging). Otherwise the game looks amazing, especially at night. Do not go out without a lantern at night because the darkness is proper darkness, unlike in most other games. The atmosphere at night is incredible as well, traveling through a dark forest, hearing the roars of (not so) distant monsters. The environments are stunning and the way the grass and trees react to what's happening around is pretty immersive. Can't say much about the story yet because I haven't gone far enough in it due to exploring and side quests. And exploration is again, quite a lot of fun. Some of the side quests have also a bit of thought put into them and you can compete them in different ways.Then there are the bugs. When I started playing a lot of them were thankfully fixed already but there's still the issue with random NPCs popping into existence right in front of the arisen, even carts with their squad of soldiers. I also had the misfortune of watching from a distance as some random pawn killed a drake by slashing it's foot for 20 minutes while the drake didn't even react.The pawns seem more alive in this game than in DDDA, they got more lines, they're way less repetitive even though there is some repetition here and there when idling. The pawn AI is pretty good now since the bigger issues have been fixed. Otherwise it's the same stuff it was in DDDA with some additions on top of it (which I see as a good thing).",1
Positive,"It is my first detailed review, but I will be honest and I will make it as detailed as possible.Dragon's Dogma 2 is a fun experience. A game worth buying, but I want to mention each section that follows with a few details:Combat: My gods, the combat can be the funniest thing you can experience. You can stomp on giants and dragons and still get cucked from wolves. Any playstyle you choose is viable and it comes with many different opportunities. While the enemies are not rich in variety, you will notice that they will also change to be stronger and different in appearance the more you progress the story. A small example is the typical early goblin that you will encounter. Later, they become bigger, armored and tend to be in bigger packs. The Elite enemies also give you a satisfying battle each time (especially when they can come out of nowhere like the griffin when you are chilling in a wagon). A solid 8.5/10.Story: At the first steps of your journey, the story is rather vague and plain. You soon learn who you truly are and what is your purpose. The majority of questlines are rather simple too, telling you do ""kill that"" or ""bring me that"". Now, without spoiling much, you have to prove through these quests who you are in this world. The problem is, the rewarding is not that satisfying, story perspective. You would expect to be noticed more for specific major NPCs but that doesn't really happen, except from one or two. Then you reach the end of the story, leading to the final boss fight. I beat it, and proceeded to continue towards the conclusion.Then the unexpected happened. There is a True ending in this game that you can follow, which in my honest opinion, it was amazing. The story line continues even after you fought the boss, and the game progresses further, and not by a simple quest, but something grant that effects the whole world and all the important NPCs too, INCLUDING your Main Pawn.In conclusion, the True ending is a must for a wholesome, fullfilling, story experience. I absolutely recommend it for anyone that found the story to be average until that point. 5/10 without true ending, 9/10 with true ending.Performance: I did not encounter a problem, maybe an fps drop around 30 when I entered the main city once. I don't have a NASA computer but my specs aren't the oldest either. I have seen many topics regarding this issue, but unfortunately I am not in position to say anything because the game is running smoothly for me. Character creation: Second only to Black Desert. It is amazing. Simple as that. Wait to see the other main Pawns from other players too if you haven't seen anything already from YT or other media.Micro-transactions: Seriously, it pains me to see this game being shadowed from that topic. The first step I did before bying this game was to check about this mtx issue that seemed to plague this game. Every choice you have in your disposal to buy , can be farmed in matter of hours, twicefold even. The only exception is the Soundtrack DLC.So the main problem here is not the choices of ""dlc"" that you can farm or receive in game, its the controversy of actually putting mtx in a single player game. I don't support that idea, by all means. But I wanted to be fair with myself, so I put things down and checked: 1) Do these mtx/dlc choices hinder my progress if I don't have them? : The answer is no.2) Are they needed for a specific part of the story or to unlock more content for it? : The answer is no.If I haven't seen all these controversial topics for this matter, online, I will be completely honest, I wouldn't even know they ACTUALLY exist in the game. There were no pop ups or anything specifically even to ""guide"" you to buy them. I emphasize on that because, unfortunately, there is a big psychological manipulation that exists behind this behaviour, hence its controversy too. So, for a game not ""guiding"" you to buy anything that is completely optional and unnecessary (except the Soundtrack, which is just not my thing), it comes clear and fair.TLDR: Solid game, worth your time and money, ignore the MTX controversy, play the game with its True ending.",1
Positive,Finally a game that made me stop playing skyrim.,1
Positive,"Really good game so far. Combat is fun and engaging, story is good so far, played around 10 hours and felt like 10 minutes. Never got bored. Interested to see how it feel 100 hours in. The one thing that did piss me off was having to delete game files to play a new character after i made my first one look goofy.",1
Positive,"30 fps in cities hasn't ruined my experience in the slightest. Combat is the most fun I've had in an RPG in a long time. Vocation system is great, different classes/vocations feel very unique and fun to play. Still in the middle of playing it, just wanted to get a quick review out here to say the performance is just fine unless you're hyper sensitive to 30 fps in non-combat city centers for whatever reason.",1
Positive,"TLDR: It's not much different from the first game. It's better looking and it feels very good to play. However, it runs like garbage and there are pointless Microtransactions.Update: After 200 hours, I've beaten the game. Granted, some of those hours was due to the game's executable running in the background randomly after I accidentally caused the game to crash.I actually was en route to get the true ending on accident, so my review is based on that experience. The game is honestly great. As someone who enjoys traveling through Morrowind, Oblivion, and then Skyrim on foot as opposed to fast traveling. I fell in love with this game instantly. In the endgame portion, I was impressed at how much and how little things change. Without going into spoilers, I feel like the endgame portion makes the experience worth it, if only because the difficulty spikes up, and now you genuinely feel like you have a purpose as opposed to just wandering around the world looking for upgrades. A lot of care was put into the world, and you can kind of tell simply by exploring the locations you used to avoid previously in order to reach locations that were previously blocked off or impassable. However, I honestly feel like the weakest part of the game is the story. Like yeah, it's a great story on paper, but its execution felt rushed and befuddled. Honestly, there were two points in the story which made me have to go online and look up what the hell I was actually doing because a character would say ""Do ABC"", your objective marker will say ""Do CBA"", and then the overall plot implies that you're doing ""BCA"". It's honestly annoying and I do not believe in the excuse that ""It's an issue with translation."" Nah, that's just poor quality control and execution. The story has potential, but it feels like your actions as The Arisen literally doesn't matter until the endgame. Your subterfuge, your actions, and the romance in this game feels like it's just set dressing. It feels like the Bethesda games where you've literally killed god, and bandits still go ""Dang, I need to loot your corpse."" You've become an unstoppable force, yet the plot pretends that you didn't just travel across the continent killing ogres, dragons, and a fucking Medusa before you reach the endgame. It's a typical problem with these kinds of games, but I feel it especially here. I will 100% buy the DLC when it comes out, because if it's on the same level as Dark Arisen then please, take my money.I've only ""played"" for about an hour.My first thoughts were negative because for whatever reason every game since 2020 needs to compile shaders before you even play it which is wild to me.After I got past that, I loaded up the character I made using their character creator.I can totally see how poor the optimization is, despite the fact that I'm running the game on the highest possible graphics and the game's buttery smooth due to a pretty damn beefy PC, though the processor and RAM is last gen. You can tell because when I dropped certain things like the shadows or even the textures DOWN to low, my frames go haywire for 10 minutes until the FSR levels it all out.The gameplay itself is so damn good though. It's almost *Witcher 3 level combat*, but it feels more fluid. The boss fight had so much going on made it hard to see what the heck was even going on, but I think that's just due to the setting and location.The graphics are actually really good. I do believe that this industry has officially hit a roadblock in terms of graphical innovation. Games will only be able to go one of two ways now: More hyper realistic, which means uncanny valley and really noticeable flaws in facial animations, and character visual fidelity; or more stylistic, using modern graphical breakthroughs to compliment current graphical abilities to provide more interesting and unique visual representations of every day things.The sound is good. It's a Capcom game, so they usually have this down.Microtransactions: They exist, and it's embarrassing. It's a 70-dollar game. DLC it a Capcom staple, but adding dumb gems, shards, or other stupid currencies is a Certified Shareholders Moment.Overall, it's a solid game, as long as your computer is up to snuff. As the TLDR said, just wait for an update that fixes optimization, as ridiculous as that is. Once again, mainstream publishers drop the ball on optimizing their damn games before releasing it.*This was a dumb comment. It's more akin to the True Directional Combat mod for Skyrim. Take that how you wish.*Update: I've played this game way too much, and I haven't even beaten it. Never have I had this much fun playing a game since Monster Hunter Worlds or even Skyrim. I will 100% admit that the game is terribly optimized, but if your computer runs it fine then you'll have fun.",1
Positive,"I absolutely loved the 1st DD and was so excited to hear it was finally getting a sequel. However, I was pretty deflated when it came out and got slammed with negative ""reviews"" and I nearly avoided buying it altogether. Well, I'm glad I didn't listen and decided to purchase it anyway. It is everything I enjoy about DD (and other action adventure RPG's) and more. The world is massive and immersive, and exploring it all is almost always rewarding. The player customization is nearly endless, and offers a ton of different ways to play. Finally, the combat is incredibly engaging and exciting and will constantly set you up with epic and memorable encounters . Sure, the trademark Capcom silliness is there at times with the story and it's characters, but you should already know what you're getting yourself into when you load up a Capcom game.In my experience, the negative comments that have bogged down this game's reviews have been unfounded: Micro-transactions? Don't pay for them and play the game normally, every single item can be acquired in-game relatively easily as you go. Frame-rate drops? Maybe i'm just me, but the MINOR drops I've experienced are not only not game-breaking, they are barely noticeable in most cases. They have not hindered my enjoyment in any way. So, if you loved DD and want more of it, this game will likely scratch the itch. If the original didn't click with you,or you're on the fence you may want wait until it goes on sale or skip it altogether, but in my opinion, you'll be missing out on an amazing experience.",1
Positive,"First, I'll get the obvious out of the way. The game currently has performance issues in big towns, caused by a CPU bottleneck (at least in my system). I get above 60fps on the open world segments so far on a 5600x, 32gb, 3070 system at 1440p with DLSS balanced and graphics set to high but RT off, so it's far from unplayable, but big towns are a different story.Still, if the combat areas continue to perform at 60fps or above, I'm mostly OK with that, it's not something truly horrible like Jedi Survivor, which was a stuttering mess and crashed whenever it wanted.With that stuff out of the way, this is pretty much the perfect game for anyone who loved the first, since it's that but with more stuff. The pawns feel quite similar, but with more varied voicelines, and the combat is as engaging as ever. Systemic interactions abound, and the usual Dragon's Dogma weird stuff is out there for all to see.Do I recommend it? If you can get over towns not performing adequately, 100%. I've had a blast in these few hours, and I fully intend to keep going for a few weeks because this stuff is my jam.",1
Positive,"i'm absolutely loving it so far. it feels so cosy like i've come home after so many years. i missed dragon's dogma so much, and the vibe in the sequel is exactly on point. it feels right, it feels warm. i Know this game. the new vocation and combat stuff is so nice, they really smoothed out the system from DDDA and it's great. idk i could honestly gush about this game for ages. highly recommend it at this point of time.performance wise i get some fps drops in the city, particularly around the tavern, but that's it. no crashes or other issues. update: yeah i love this game. easily one of my favourites ever. i'm addicted, i can't put it down, i'm so attached to my arisen and pawn, i loved the ending. only downside really is no scaling in ng+ but yeah. i love this game!",1
Positive,"Edit 2: It took a very long time, but they've fixed the performance issues, and with that being said, a few months later, i've returned to play more and the game still just scratches an itch no other game can satisfy, and for that, I want to change my review from a longstanding negative, to a positive, in hopes that this franchise can continue to deliver the magic I've come to adore from the Dogma seriesEdit: I just swallowed my pride a couple days later and restarted, after the lost progress, this time with steam cloud sync turned OFF. Over 20+ hours in and I am addicted to this game, in spite of the performance issues (my cooling situation was so bad i took my side panel off for my PC tower) and I still do not recommend it on the sole principal that CAPCOM needs to understand EXACTLY why the reviews have come to this. Even a lifelong fan knows right from wrong, and it's wrong to release a game in this state, and then also ask for more money on top of that.I have been waiting for this game for years. I was so obsessed with the first game that I played Dragon's Dogma Online with google translate (it was JP only) just to play more of it. When this finally dropped I immediately dumped 5 hours into it in a single session, but at the end of the session, my autosave corrupted, and would no longer properly save the game. I tried manually saving after that and it also didn't work. Then my PC froze up, and it was utterly unusable. I had to hard shutdown, and when I booted the game back up, my biggest fear came true, and my progress was completely gone. More than anyone I want to give this game a good review, but CAPCOM absolutely played us for fools, and even snuck in micro-transactions on the Day 1 patch. Do not buy this, until they figure their shit out.",1
Positive,"Reviewed this game on launch. After completion, opinion has changed DRASTICALLY.As an achievement hunter, time is money. Until now, there were 3 single-player games in recent years that I have been willing to return to even long after 100% has been achieved: Monster Hunter World, Nioh 2, and Elden Ring. For better or for worse, Dragon's Dogma 2 has joined that list.The thing that bothered me most about this game was all the misinformation going around on the internet even to this day. ""Capcom sold out to MTX practices"", ""performance is terrible on launch. fix your game!"", ""this mechanic bricks your save."" None of these can be farther from the truth. I am a witness, and my testimony is to declare that Capcom, albeit with a griffin-sized caveat, is not in the wrong here. Compared to other game companies of the modern era (esp. the western politics&money-driven ones), Capcom only did what was necessary to gain a profit from its product, which I wholeheartedly declare a masterpiece. At the same time, I also want to note that Dragon's Dogma 2 is not for everyone. It is a game that requires a bit of pre-planning if you don't want to throw in the towel and give up on your progression midway. With some amount of meticulous research, I was able to complete a 99.98% completion playthrough on the first run - while only missing one romance line because of the unforgiving quest progression design. I blame myself for being naive enough to believe the internet on launch without giving the game a chance to make an impression on me personally. Nevertheless, here I am now, writing a second and more thorough review to drop some wisdom on you pawns.Vocations & Pawn SystemVocations remind me very much of the weapon system in the Monster Hunter series, and that's what has me HOOKED even after 100%. For me, jack of all trades/maxing all vocations is a given, yet you also have the time spent to commit to different builds within EACH vocation thereafter. Surprisingly, there's no achievement for maxing all vocation levels, but they do have one related to gaining all maister skills. So obviously, the completionist has a reason and drive to be hungry: to become a god of war by getting every vocation to max level + all maister skills + dragonforged weapon&gear. Right? That's where the endgame lies. And that's why games like Dragon's Dogma 2, while being singleplayer, are still such gems that RPG enthusiasts can still enjoy to our heart's content. Multiplayer games like LoL and Overwatch rely on seasonal rank and number of unlocked/purchased skins to display how much time, blood, sweat, and tears you've invested into the games. Games like Elden Ring and Dragon's Dogma? Your save file and progression are all the proof you need.The pawn system is unique and engaging in its own right. There's not much else to be said other than the fact that it retains its functions from Dark Arisen and then some, plus the AI seems to be relatively awesome considering you can have up to 3 pawns following you around. With four simple commands, they do what you need them to, without making you have to micromanage them too frequently while out on the road. And when they start trashtalking or being a negative nancy? INTO THE BRINE.Open WorldJust like Elden Ring, Dragon's Dogma 2 deserves endless respect for the quality of the open world. One-time 30-second wait time after loading up your save file and BOOM. The entire world is at your disposal. No wait times when opening doors, zero loading when hopping in and out of a riftstone, and instant menus popping up and down when you need to deposit/withdraw/buy/sell/equip your gear. This may be an individual experience and others spoke of FPS dips and all that, but overall it just comes down to your own experience. Sometimes, we take these things for granted with all the F-tier games that have been coming out lately. But, let's remember folks: quality of life matters in RPGs.Quest Design/Progression & NG+Hear me out. Getting locked out of quest progression and NPCs getting Thanos-snapped out of existence are not good at first glance. But weren't the true gamers at one point complaining about how Ubisoft games spoonfeed us with UI mumbo jumbo? Weren't we complaining that games were too easy and there was a need to go back to the golden era of true exploration? Dragon's Dogma 2 makes you THINK. And the younger generation of gamers need to do more of that. All they care about are hopping into games, picking up a gun within 2 minutes, and just shooting things. IMHO Dragon's Dogma 2 is a game wherein if you want to really get your money's worth, a bit of meticulous calculation, planning, and care could go a long way. By all means, play the way you want. But personally, I think this is the way the game was designed to be played in the long-term.NG+ is a different breed altogether, but to avoid spoilers, I won't go too deep into it. Just know that you're never REALLY truly locked out of anything.Pro tip #1: Turning in crystals to Ambrosius isn't the point of no return. Entering the tower at the end is the TRUE point of no return for pre-NG+ progression, so feel free to take your time!$2.99 Portcrystals, etc.At this rate, I'm afraid Capcom games will have longer lists of payable DLC and MTX than Koei Tecmo games, and that's saying a LOT (the most I've seen on a DOA or DW game in the recent years was about 90 items in ONE title). My only two cents on this topic is that they're NOT NECESSARY. I went around leveling vocations, got gold from goblins and selling exploits, and had 2mil+ gold to buy all your travel resource needs. And don't forget the oxcart has a DOZE OFF option to speed it up! Often times, we hate on other games for even HAVING mtx, but DD2 unfortunately deserves to be ""forgiven"" in this case because of the quality of the game itself. Flame me for not knowing what I'm talking about, but I'm biased af here and that's the stance I take as a consumer. If the game is good, let it do what other trash games do anyway. I'd rather pay extra money to a game that I enjoy than pay for DLC in a game that doesn't deserve respect for any of its traits. But as I said, I didn't spend a dime outside of the base game/edition I purchased on day one.Protip #2: Use oxcarts when possible, go to another town while micromanaging what you need to do a.k.a. don't just port around aimlessly without a plan, use portcyrstals wisely, and hoard ferrystones until you absolutely need them. If you're smart when playing the game and be patient, you wouldn't need to spend another dime either.StoryHoping to hear some news about DLC soon, but even then, the story will probably be lackluster. Don't expect any ""subverting expectations"" here. It's your average save-the-world storyline with some subpar wow moments along the way. Gaming industry needs some better writers, or just let AI take over altogether.OH, and Capcom can take some notes from Witcher 3 for romance scenes. These were god-awful.Missing Features on LaunchThey really knew what they were doing with the MTX when they gave us ONE SINGLE GAME FILE on launch. Few weeks later, they add a START NEW GAME feature, but still no multiple save data slots. Come on Capcom. Don't test our patience.Final Verdict: SDragon's Dogma 2 is (arguably) a masterpiece and Capcom should really invest into the IP for the next 10 years. Hands down one of the most fun experiences I've had in an action-RPG. The game has its flaws, but the overall product did not disappoint whatsoever.",1
Positive,"Contrary to many other reviews, I have not experienced any noticeable issues with the above system. I have not crashed throughout the entirety of my playtime, nor did I encounter any broken quests or other miscellaneous glitches. Performance has been very consistent as well, with the single exception in the city of Vernworth causing me to drop between 5 and 10 frames on occasion.Dragon s Dogma 2 looks absolutely phenomenal; apart from sheer graphical fidelity, there is an obscene amount of detail in the environment and how creatures interact with it. A lot of this is also somewhat needed, as arguably the game s best moments are hidden outside of the main quest and are therefore reliant on the player picking out clues from the environment to find them. A tower in the distance, a statue pointing towards a shrine hidden somewhere in the mountains, and more. The sound is a bit of a mixed bag. Overall, I find DD1 s OST to be a bit more memorable, though here it is still perfectly fitting. Weapons feel and sound impactful, and I have found the voice acting to be quite good in both English and Japanese. One thing to note is that regardless of the quality of the music, it can be a bit jarring to dip in and out of the same combat tracks, since especially large enemy encounters have become a lot more common.DD2 shares the same setting as its predecessor, in which the player controls an Arisen, once a regular human who stood against a dragon and, for their efforts, had its heart taken by the same dragon, thus becoming effectively immortal but also bound to eventually confront it again. This is all linked to a political intrigue surrounding the sovereignship of one of the two major kingdoms. There is a significant focus on making Dragon s Dogma 2 a bit more of a narrative experience. Many sidequests will cross over one another in ways that may not be apparent at first; there are no quest indicators either, forcing the player to go out of their way and intuit how a story may progress. Like the many optional encounters hidden away from the main story, the questing experience relies heavily on the player making an effort to seek many of them out on their own. A point of criticism should be that there are both time-sensitive quests and multiple points of no return during the story, which are not always properly communicated. While I found the main story to be serviceable and the sidequests actively quite good, sometimes the game is a bit too ambiguous for its own good, such as during the notorious Sphinx Riddles or, albeit this not being strictly speaking a proper quest, the completely unreasonable task of finding Seeker Tokens, 220 medals hidden all across the obscenely huge map.As an action RPG, Dragon s Dogma features a selection of class kits the player can freely switch between. These range from fairly standard archetypes such as archers, fighters, and mages to more eccentric additions such as the new Mystic Spearhand a Battlemage archetype. Each of these Vocations levels up separately from the player, offering both skills that are unique to itself and augmentations that can be freely used on any other Vocation as well, heavily incentivizing experimentation. Aside from the Arisen, players also create a Pawn who acts as a permanent party member, and that doubles as a soft multiplayer feature. This is due to Pawns being shared online, allowing any player to hire up to two additional Pawns next to their own. Pawns learn during gameplay as well; as such, if your Pawns has witnessed you completing a quest objective, it will offer guidance to another player hiring it into their party. I do genuinely love this concept, as it is very appealing to try and develop your Pawn to be more useful to other group compositions as well. I do kind of wish that the quest guide functionality would be a bit more in-depth than just the Pawns generally guiding you to the location in question, however.In combat, aside from the skills you set yourself according to your vocation, an integral part of DD is the ability to grab and climb on monsters. In Dragon s Dogma 1, it was vital to be able to deal significant damage, which this game is a little less strict about due to simply higher damage potential, but is still a vital part of gameplay. Some enemies require it for certain objectives, such as being able to behead a Medusa as such, few skills or mechanics feel meaningless in combat; rather, it is up to the player how deeply they want to engage in their party building. Due to the difficulty of the game generally becoming easier and easier, however, people may miss the sheer depth character building could reach during a dungeon like Bitterblack Isle.This would also constitute my greatest criticism, as currently Dragon s Dogma 2 becomes quite grindy due to the time-limited postgame requiring a vast amount of raw resources to max out your equipment, whereas there is no true content that actually requires it, and thus rewards carrying on the gameplay loop past the initial playthrough. Dragon s Dogma 2 is a fantastic sequel. It is very close to being the best open-world game that I have played too, with most of my criticism stemming from the fairly niche design decisions that, however, also make up its appeal. Limited fast travel may be obnoxious, but it undoubtedly adds to the immersion and supports the exploration that the game so heavily relies upon, for example. It is DD1, but more of it be that for better or for worse.Follow our Curator page, Summit Reviews , to see more high-quality reviews regularly.",1
Positive,I didn't even know this game had microtransactions until I checked the review scores.,1
Positive,"There is a limit to how much inconvenience and unfriendliness can be dressed up as something 'idealized.' It s unreasonable to call presenting an incomplete product, from which many necessary aspects for enjoying the game have been removed, a 'philosophy.' At this price point, it's difficult to recommend the game with a light heart.Setting aside discussions about DLCs or game systems, the most disappointing aspect was how many quests and stories felt incomplete or ended abruptly. The most enjoyable moments occurred when I ventured off the beaten path to explore, away from my backlog of quests. However, even these enjoyable experiences were often disrupted by inconveniences and an unfriendliness disguised as 'idealized' or 'philosophical.'Ultimately, this recommendation is very precarious, leaning strongly towards not recommending the game.+As I continued writing, I found myself listing only the drawbacks. Nevertheless, I recommend this game because I believe the fun it offers, even if just a little, outweighs the drawbacks.",1
Positive,"I would recommend this game with a big asterisk.the game does a VERY good job at making you feel badass: whether you like to be a wizard that shoots meteors from the sky, or summon a hurricane on command, a rogue that leaps on an ogre and methodically hits their weakpoints, or any of the other unique and fleshed out classes you can choose from. The asterisk here is that the game severly lacks mechanics like dodging and timed parries. This makes the combat often feel like I'm just spamming abilities with some occasional repositioning.Another great feature is that the game has great RPG immersion. The character customization is insanely intricate, the gear looks cool and becomes progressively more epic (which really adds to the sense of becoming stronger) and the pawn system had me picking pawns that had a unique look which added to the immersion. The big asterisk here though is that the story is very very shallow. At the end I was left thinking ""is that it?"" as others have mentioned.All in all I had a great time, but at some point I couldn't be bothered to do any more sidequest and just focused on completing the main storyline. So if you're really into the RPG aspect (this game made me feel like I did in witcher 3, skyrim & BG3), then it might be worth picking up on a discount.",1
Positive,"I demanded a sequel and only received bittersweet disappointment.This is Dragon's Dogma 1.2.Whatever you do, don't come for the story. Be here for the world and the gameplay. And do not become too heartbroken once you realize there's 12 monsters to fight.I honestly recommend just playing Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen. Not only is it significantly cheaper, and tbf is almost as filled with holes and issues as this game. But the cohesive charm keeps it together way better. And the Dark Arisen DLC adds a completely new flavor to the entire experience and pushes you to understand what the game wants from you more.I will continue holding (c)hope for a proper Dragon's Dogma 2.",1
Positive,"All in all, Dragon's Dogma 2 is an adventure of epic proportions, but not without its flaws. Let me list what I enjoyed and what I did not, let's start with the positive: The character creator is INSANE! Without a doubt the best, most detailed one out there (that I've ever seen). I actually, shamelessly re-created myself - given a choice, I want my first playthrough of any game to truly be MINE and in DD2 I could quite literally make that so!The first few hours and the last were the most amazing! Your first fight against a cyclops, griffin or dragon are simply unforgettable! The build-up in strength, too, is amazing to witness and well fleshed out. I got my butt kicked in under five minutes by the first dragon I ran into but by mid-game it was the other way around and felt very satisfying! The exploration, too - at the beginning - is amazing. There's a lot to see and explore. I thought I had looked at every Nook and Crannie but never did get the Achievement for having found 50 caves! I personally thought there were enough Vocations to keep it interesting. I fell in love with Mystic Spearhand and stuck with it all game through (I had also mastered Fighter & Warrior). My dear Amaterasu (Main Pawn) was a Magician and Sorcerer and had a blast terrorizing local wildlife, bandits and monsters alike. There were truly funny moments, too - like her handing me herbs, after a grueling fight against a troll, pleasantly going ""Here you go master!"" like we had just enjoyed some nice, quiet lunch instead of a vicious fight! The ending was truly momentous. I went for the regular Good ending first, before attempting the True ending and (all cussing aside) it was truly worth it! Literally EPIC - to not give away spoilers, I'll leave it at that.But let me just say, when I read people had shed some tears, I had rolled my eyes, thinking it exaggerated - until it happened to me, too. Full marks! What I didn't enjoy:The ENDLESS walking. Endless. no fight was tougher than the mile-long hikes through the same areas. I had plenty of Portcrystals set up, but at some point almost ran out of Ferrystones and it was. painful. That was near the end, when I had thought I had explored most of Batthal (haha. I had not.) and forced myself to keep going anyway - due to the amazing ending, I am glad I did BUT it was definitely a slog and required a lot of willpower. I didn't really mind the banter between the pawns too much but it got definitely repetitive. Same with the small variety of enemies. What enemies they threw in, were truly epic, don't get me wrong! The Chimeras. dragons. griffins. the Medusa. the Sphinx - glorious fights! But there simply were too many Goblins and wolves and Cyclops and Trolls (and Gods. did I hate the trolls!)The side-quests were interesting but without Google & Reddit I would not have been able to figure out how to go about some of them. I am all for letting people explore and figure things out themselves, but that was, in places, a but too cryptic. The story itself was also a bit all over the place, but fortunately, the true ending definitely made up for that.That about sums it up. I only ever bought exactly ONE item with real money and that was one extra Portcrystal. So, the rage about the Microtransactions baffles me, as you're in no way required to buy ANY of them. Other companies are much much worse about that and get no grief over it whatsoever. So, as I said - all in all, DD2 was definitely an epic adventure! A glorious RPG with great moments, monstrous fights and plenty of adventures! Definitely recommend!",1

please bro, don't let us down man), that would be awesome!if you haven't played the first game, don't jump head first into this one, you might not like this type of game, it's a very unique game i suggest you either play the first one (get it on sale, it's like 5 bucks) and see if you like this type of game. also watch this first: - *******************************************************************************you know. idk what people are looking for in this game! but just today one of my pawns said ""have you ever wondered how it just so happens that we only ever have men in our party?"" and my main pawn was like ""oh, better not jump to conclusions, since we have just set foot on our journey""to me just this one line, with its MANY implications and assumptions is so INCREDIBLY HILARIOUS, that honestly it just made my whole playthrough! idk if this one line right here was worth 35 bucks, but it certainly feels like it!what i'm trying to say is, i enjoy this world that i am immersed in! i enjoy the combat, i enjoy the time spent with the pawns, the quests, the environment, everything is so relaxing and pleasant, often exhilarating!another instance was this: i just noticed how one guy who gave me a quest for saving his brother remarked that ""i was cowardly i will never let my brother alone from this day forth"" - from this you can see this game has been sort thought out to also be a bit of a moralizing experience in a way! like you can actually ponder some of the things you encounter in the world! that was just so wholesome, so cozy!to me, and to many others, this game is a very very rough diamond that shines ever so brightly across today's gaming landscape! so i would've hated for anyone like myself to look at the reviews and be robbed of it! that's the reason for writing this review!**************you can also check out the comments i made here: https://steamcommunity.com/app/2054970/discussions/0/4694532035335710296/they help flesh out the review a bit more, since they're more in depth because i had about 100 hrs when i made those comments",1
Positive,"Dragons dogma 2 is an excellent, often thrilling ARPG, with something to do or discover around every corner, it has some of the best combat mechanics in a video game bar none, and has one of, if not, the best, implementation of a day night cycle I have experienced, night time genuinely feels dangerous, and the risk versus reward goes through the roof. Enemies are varied and always fun to fight, providing a decent amount of challenge but not frustratingly so. Story is there and is suitably engaging but not overly memorable. The gameplay is really the star of the show here. So all is perfect right? Well not exactly, some voice acting is a bit questionable, lip syncing is laughably bad at times, and the strange omission of not being able to start a new game from scratch feels like a massive oversight at best or an ominous attempt at some form of monetisation at worst. Having said that Capcom have pledged to fix these issues for PC players at least. I feel I have to also address the other boogie men of performance and micro transactions. Micro transactions are in the game in the form of DLC that can be purchased to make life in the game easier. However purchasing these items is totally optional and EVERYTHING is available in game at no extra cost, the micro transactions are not intrusive or necessary to progress they are simply there if you can t be bothered to find or grind for the item, the choice is yours. The hysteria surrounding these micro transactions is a little silly as they are completely optional. Not all micro transactions are created equally, these are simply here as a convenience not a necessity. The other issue I am seeing a lot of is performance, and this seems to be a bit of an odd one, there are people reporting that their 4090 is getting 12 fps while others on much older cards are reporting much better performance, so what s going on here? The fact is the game is CPU bound, so the best graphics cards in the world aren t going to make a difference if they are being run by an ancient CPU, personally I am running a RTX 4070TI and performance has been in the 60-90 fps range, perfectly acceptable, Capcom have admitted there is a performance issue and again have pledged to fix it. The game is great, if you like the look of it and enjoyed the first game, go get it.",1
Positive,"Character creation's really well done and the gameplay is about as you'd expect, fast and fluid. a big improvement over the first game in every way, however it runs like an old person with severe arthritis and crippling asthma. Problems are beyond just the fact that denuvo is on this and the CPU usage is ridiculous, this crap engine already gave me issues with SF6 and they decided to use it for an open world game, Yippee. Game struggles to maintain 60 and dips to about 30 in towns. In its current state Its really badly optimised and will probably take some time to get patched, or modded. Really stupid that this is yet another AAA game that came out terribly on PC. NOTE: You cannot delete your saves (A PC only issue) and you have only 5 Devices you can install this on. Would Only recommend this game if you have a good System and are willing to compromise with console framrerates. Would love to give it a mixed option but for its current state on launch its a 6/10 Solely carried by the gameplay. I am not defending Capcom's greed and their underhanded business tactics but this is a fantastic game and cant wait to see it get fixed if ever, but judging by the fact that its tied to NPCs and towns are populated with a lot of them, I cant imagine it getting fixed anytime soon.This in all honesty should have been Capcom's easiest win but they fumbled on what is essentially one of the greatest open world RPG experiences.",1
Positive,F to all my Arisen brothers and sisters who didn't make it to see a new Dragon's Dogma game.,1
Positive,fun gameplay. Haven't interacted with micro transactions.,1
Positive,"Would you like to go on a grand adventure,with goblins,griffins,dragons set in a large open world setting.I like being on a quest and then suddenly I am off exploring a cave I discovered which takes me in an entirelydifferent direction and then actually ties into my quest.Exploring is rewarded, and exploring you will do.Crafting and gathering is fun, and you can combine items on the fly.Weapons and gear can be upgraded, you can now change your in game appearance with a token or gold.You can try different vocations, hire and dismiss two of your pawns to try new ones and different group dynamics.Your main pawn you keep with you for the whole journey.Combat feels good and solid, while still being fun & exciting.Camping is what you do out in the field when your health starts dropping and to refresh the party.The game is now in a good state with stable performance, never had a crash in thirty hours.Game is a ton of fun, will back to my game,just wanted to stop and give it a shout out.",1
Positive,"1 - My review is based on my experience playing the game with Frame Generation mod installed. If I wasn't using it, this game would be at max a 3/10 due to performance issues even when I'm using a 13900K + 4090 setup.The review:Amazing game, very addictive for reasons I can't yet explain. I've played better games that didn't get a hold on me like this one. Is it the story? Heck no. But the world building and gameplay are very good.I dislike the fact that NPCs in the city and everywhere really, don't react to stuff you do like stealing from inside people's houses etc. To trigger a reaction the only thing that does it is draw your weapon and they flee.NG+ feels a bit off due to no enemy scaling. The MTX complaints are valid but to be fair I had more than I could spend in items without ever even consider buying any MTX.8/10",1
Positive,Really like the gameplay. Capcom just need to fix performance issue and it s 10/10. Really all the reviews were talking about microtransaction. You dont need it. Just play the fucking game for god sake.,1
Positive,"She dragons on my dogma 'til my dark is arisen, then she breathes fire on my convictions until my shadows find the light.",1
Positive,"Great game, great successor to the first game (as somebody with ~500h). Movement a bit clunky, worse than in the first, enemy variety in general isn t great, otherwise very enjoyable.Ran perfect, no crashes. Microtransactions absolutely irrelevant, you can get pretty much everything in the game very easily. You wouldn t even know they re there if there wasn t such a big fuss around them.",1
Positive,"Good game, exploration and combat are excellent.It would be 10/10 for me if the endgame was better or ng+ got some more love. I hope that we are gonna see something like black isle form first game in future dlc/update.And of course optimization got better after recent patch but it's still pretty garbage.",1
Positive,"Honestly, for what I like from Dragon's Dogma most (combat and exploration, and wacky but immersive stuff), I prefer this game over the first. I can't really speak on the story, as I haven't gotten far in 2's story yet, but the exploration and fun factor is just so good imo.",1
Positive,"Let s start with the obvious.Are there micro transactions? Yes. However, aside from the tent cosmetics, all the stuff can be earned in game. Yes, it s still scummy and shouldn t exist, but there are some misconceptions surrounding it. I don t fault anyone for giving a negative review. I am giving it a positive because, despite the MTX, the game is a blast. A rare open world rpg that trusts the player to think and make their own adventure. And I haven t been this sucked into a game since BG3.In terms of performance, I ve heard it varies dramatically depending on your rig. For me, I m playing on a 4090 with a 13th gen i9 with RT on and no DLSS needed. I m getting well above 100fps. I am in the vast minority in terms of hardware, however and YMMV.The game itself, from my 5 hours, is masterful. An improvement over the first in pretty much every way. From the way the story is delivered, to the combat, to the handcrafted open world and the enemy encounters. Hiring and switching out pawns is fun, sending them back to their owners with gifts is a cool little touch that makes you feel attached to other players despite it being a single player game. The pawns add a depth to the game and you re always looking for the ideal party set up to compliment your build. As a sword and shield build, having a caster on my team that heals me has been life saving. I really like the music and voice acting as well (the lip syncing is the stuff of nightmares, however very stiff animations that never match up with the words).Overall, I highly recommend this game. Definitely consider your specs and do some research if you re playing on a mid or lower tier rig.",1
Positive,"Fun really wish I could zoom the camera out further, feels squashed in",1
Positive,"After finishing the game i can finally say I recommend it.Some of the problems are:- Performance issues;- Micro-transactions for a single player game;- Can't delete your save file through the game; (FIXED)- Very High CPU demand;Edit: I finished the game and even though I am displeased with the performance issues and unnecessary micro-transactions, I still gotta say I had a blast playing the game.The story is okayish, but the world exploration and combat is just exquisite. I'm aware that the game has flaws, which are in most cases similar to the first game, but at the same time it REALLY delivers in everything else. PS: The game shouldn't have micro transactions, BUT at least they are totally useless. All of the items being sold are not only easily accessible in-game but also in most cases part of a system that require more than just one component to work. So if you are thinking on just buying the port crystal and start fast travelling around the map, think again. The item is simply a beacon that you can place anywhere in the map that will allow you to teleport back there, as long as you have ferrystones(another item necessary for fast travels). And both port crystal and ferrystones can be found or bought easily in-game, after finishing my playthrough I had at least 20 ferrystones and 2 portcrystals in the storage.Bottom Line: If you played the fist game and enjoyed it, than you'll definitely enjoy this one. If you haven't played the first, but still like/love ARPG with a living open world full of caves and corners. Well this is the right game for you. For everyone else, I would recommend watching some videos or streams to help you decide.",1
Positive,"Edit: After Capcom released numerous patches to fix performance, I changed the rating to YES.The game is absolutely fantastic and very addicting, yet I can't forgive Capcom for releasing a 70 USD title with such poor optimization and performance issues, on top of the audacity of releasing Day 1 pay-to-win DLC (even though you can earn the stuff in-game).Dragon's Dogma 2 is the game I've been waiting for over 10 years. I absolutely loved the first and played it for countless hours. The sequel expands everything the original title offered, pumped to eleven. It's really hard to put the controller down once I start playing.That said, this is a very punishing game: you can fail quests, NPCs can die (including quest-givers) and there is a certain mechanic within the game that can potentially kill all the NPCs in a town. There is absolutely no hand-holding in this title. This game probably has the best character customization I've ever seen. It's incredibly detailed and there are crazy stuff you can do. Just check Reddit to see all kinds of characters people make. Combat is meaty and filled with depth. It feels like something between Monster Hunter and Dark Souls. A bit on the sluggish side as you have to commit to your attacks, but there are a plenty of animation cancel through skills. The whole mechanic of climbing monsters is huge appeal. Exploration is satisfying, and despite the game being open world, you'll always stumble on something interesting every so often. The Pawns will always alert if there are any points of interest and mark them on the map. This is arguably one of the best open worlds I've ever seen. There is rarely ""empty space"" that plagues so many other open world games. You'll always find items to harvest, meet a traveling pawn or a merchant, or stumble upon a small group of enemies every few steps. And the world design is so beautiful and varied it never feels stale. You have a lot of freedom to do what you want, when you want. There are also multiple ways to solve quests. The dungeons are incredibly claustrophobic in the best way possible. The reliance on using light to navigate dark caverns is something I loved in the original game, and it's pumped to eleven here. The revised Vocations, as well the brand new hybrid Vocations, feel so good to control. Mystic Spearhand is super fun and my favorite so far. The power fantasy is much stronger in this game compared to the first one. The game has plenty of graphics settings to tweak with. Nearly non-existing loading times, surprisingly. The story is a mixed bag. The first game had a clear, defined objective: find Grigori (The Dragon) and kill him. In this one The Dragon doesn't even have a name and he doesn't feel impacting to the story in the slightest, until the very end. They also try to pull some Game of Thrones vibes with political machinations but it never pays off. The whole plot feels incredibly disconnected. Lots of characters that are featured in the trailer, cover and promotional material barely appear in the story. There is no build-up and there is no pay off. Things happen at random without explanation. It's not some cryptic writing like Dark Souls, just plain bad. The camera is a bit janky sometimes, especially inside dungeons such as caverns with tight walls. While you can increase the field-of-view, it's not enough. There are plenty of times where I get hit from stuff offscreen that I have no time to react. Despite the Pawn system being refined, the Pawn AI still is a bit dumb sometimes. They will often approach enemies head on, even the likes of Mages and Sorcerers. I've lost count how many times my Pawns killed themselves by standing in front of enemies. There is still a lot of platforming in this game but the it doesn't really work very well. Movement can feel janky and very unprecise. While you do have a lot of freedom, there are a couple of times where the game doesn't really explain what you need to do. The game still uses a couple of outdated mechanics from the first title, most notably poor inventory management and vague ability tooltips. No gear / skill loadout system. This was an issue in the original game and it persists here. Swapping between Vocations is still a massive chore. There is a LOT of backtracking. This existed in the original but the world size was like, a tenth of the sequel. I understand this is part of Itsuno's vision and I actually enjoy the traveling, but it can get annoying. Lack of enemy variety that is somehow less than the first game. I wish there were more races to choose from. You can make humans and ""cat people"", but would be pretty cool if there were other races to choose from. It's a huge step for the series though. Another huge red flag is the fact this single player game launched with a bunch of microtransactions. So incredibly scummy. Reminds me of Tales of Arise. Capcom joining the practices of Day 1 Pay-to-Win DLC is really disappointing (fast travel, camps, items and even character recustomization). Sure, none of them are actual pay-to-win because they can be found in the actual game, but it's still a very bad practice. It uses DENUVO, which definitely plays a role in the bad performance. I heard some rumors that it's also using Enigma Protector too. I don't get why two DRMs in a single player game. There's no incentive to play New Game Plus since there is no Hard Difficulty. You can restart the game with all your levels and gear, but enemies will not scale to it. So you'll be just one shotting everything with no actual challenge.I feel really bad for Itsuno-san, because he's an incredibly passionate game designer who worked hard to convince Capcom to let him make the sequel and fulfill his vision for the original Dragon's Dogma, but this game really needed more time in the oven to polish performance on PC (not sure about consoles). It's clear the game was released in this state to meet deadlines set by Capcom.And this whole situation sucks because the game is incredibly fun, polishing the gameplay of the original game in a very satisfying way, but the glaring performance issues make hard to fully enjoy it. At least I didn't encounter any bugs so far (aside from occasional Pawn pathing), which is surprising considering a game of this scope.I'm really hoping we'll get a DLC for this game, but with Itsuno leaving Capcom and Monster Hunter Wilds right around the corner, I don't think we'll get anything, unfortunately.",1
Positive,Because of this game I no longer believe steam reviews. Its fantastic.,1
Positive,"TLDR; The game itself is great, like DDDA but better. The only problem for me are the performance issues. I will happily update my review if they get fixed because I love the game in and of itself.updated 1st day impressions: I have to say that the performance issues really are noticeable, especially for someone who meets the recommended specs. I wouldn't mind lower fps overall if it was stable, unfortunately, it's quite frequent for me to get fps drops in towns and the city. I just kind of got used to it by now because otherwise I am enjoying the game immensely.The game itself is incredibly good. It really feels like a dragon's dogma game to me. The vibes are here. Ddda is so incredibly important to me and this game really matches that feeling of nostalgia. It's like. I know this game, you know? It feels like home to me. I love that the pawns never shut up, I love that the merchants repeat the same line over and over again. I love the gathering system being the same, I love how the setting feels so familiar. I love the combat and how more intuitive it feels now. I love this game because I loved the first one and this is more of the same thing. It feels like coming home. If you love DDDA you will love this one too.As for the microtransactions, I am definitely not a fan. I honestly hate them, I do, but I wish people would fact-check before posting negative reviews, as you can get those items (I think except the music dlc) in-game for free with minimal effort.",1
Positive,"Dragon's Dogma 2 is a great game that lives upto its predecessor in terms of combat and drastically improved visuals, environment but not so much in the story department.Masterworks all, alright but they did go wrong :(Breathing, vibrant and fully explorable open worldEngaging combat and bossfights that are absolutely cinematic and a treat for eyesNew vocations that are really good and sometimes makes you the boss Improved pawn system/interaction which makes the game a bit more interesting (though the dialogs can get repetitive at times which didn't bother me but can annoy others)A masterwork in character customisation and one of the best that I've seen till now.The only game where I didnot feel walking from point A to point B boring or frustrating as there were threat and surprises lurking at every corner that made exploration really engaging.Performance can sometime tank in crowded places like cities which has reduced a lot after the recent patch and can improve more in further patches.The exploration though fun, isn't rewarding at all. I have found equipments with way better stats from the shops than the caves/dungeons.Apart from few new variety of enemies, there's no new addition and it's always the same lot of goblins and saurians in the caves.No enemy scaling in NG+What really bothered me is the story. It just ends abruptly and feels incomplete.For the returning players like me who have high expectations from this, I would just say that this is the same game. More like Dragon's Dogma Remake.Overall, it's a great game and would always recommend this to those who look for adventures and love fighting huge mythical creatures, climbing them and stabby stabby their face. It's unique in its own way and one must definitely play this once in their life.",1
Positive,"This game is so much fun, even more enjoyable than the first one. With a beautifully crafted world that never gets boring to explore despite the lengthy journey. Adventuring with your own character accompanied by a friend's pawn adds to the fun, with enjoyable role-playing and smart AI pawns assisting in the adventure. The gameplay is incredibly satisfying, with challenging combat and boss battles. In the 24 hours I played, I didn't encounter any issues like bugs or crashes.Regarding the microtransactions that many people are talking about, I see them as optional choices. You can obtain everything through gameplay; you can farm Gold and RC to acquire items available in microtransactions, like the Art of Metamorphosis Book used to change your character's appearance.However, I must admit, the game optimization is very poor. My GPU isn't fully utilized, and instead, my CPU works excessively hard. No matter what settings I use, it doesn't improve the game's performance.You should be wise in giving reviews, as I believe people tend to exaggerate the issue of microtransactions. Capcom has already implemented microtransactions in previous games like the Resident Evil series and Monster Hunter, which even offers a ""Character Edit Voucher."" Microtransactions are simply for those who are lazy to grind and farm; you'll enjoy the gameplay if you start from scratch.",1
Positive,"this game is genuinely phenominal. It does not deserve the mixed reviews that it has on steam. Are the Microtransactions stupid, and greedy? yes. but they're also fully meaningless and you should play the game without any of them because they're worthless and you can get every item being sold for a trivial amount of effort. the game is 10/10, full stop.",1
Positive,"i enjoy the game a lot. gameplay wise it is basically what it says on the tin: dragon's dogma. and for everyone who wanted more dragon's dogma after finishing dragon's dogma: dark arisen you will certainly be getting it with dragon's dogma 2. so i can easily recommend the game for people who enjoyed the first game. that is the short of itif you come into the game expecting it to be dark souls, monster hunter, the witcher, baldur's gate, or anything else then you are going to be disappointed. it is not any of those games, it is dragon's dogma, just like it says in the title. maybe there are other games like dragon's dogma, but in that case i have never played them, so i do not have any good point of reference to compare it toand if you have not played dragon's dogma, why in the world are you shelling out $70 for the sequel? go and play the first game. the story may be standalone in dd2, but the setting and context for it builds on first game. more importantly, ddda is a fantastic game in its own rightpositivessolid gameplay foundation and loop. lots of different vocations to try and a lot of different approaches can be taken in combat. similar to the previous game, the mechanics and feel of the battles is an arpg at its height. the grappling and climbing on bigger enemies is a high point for me especiallythe pawn system is what really sets the game apart from others in the genre, and one of my favorite novel systems in the franchise. you create an npc sidekick which follows you around on your journey and helps you to the best of its ability. this npc can also be ""rented"" to other players on the network. similarly you might want to hire pawns from other players to give yourself an edge in combat, to help with quests, or just to translate idiotic elven babble for youlike in the original the setting is also deceptively different from its first appearances and presentation as high fantasy slop. it uses themes and subject matter from mythology, religion, and philosophy that it is rare to see in a game like this, and you might not expect. unfortunately the forays into these themes are typically pretty surface level compared to the original, which was not very in depth in the first placethe setting and worldbuilding also integrates a lot of the more game mechanical aspects of dragon's dogma pretty stylishly and seamlessly. sewing crunch mechanics into the fluff of the worldbuilding makes it deceptively easy to get immersed into what is actually a completely goofy and insane setting if you spend more than a few seconds thinking about it. i also love the use of archaic english to sell the medieval setting, and i get to learn that domain and jail were at some point written ""demesne"" and ""gaol"" as a bonusnegativesit does have a lot of shortfalls. i think a lot of people who played the first game were hoping that dd2 might have released in a more finished state than the first game. unfortunately it does not seem to be the case. a lot of the content is half baked, a lot of ideas were started but left ""unfinished"" is a sense i get with a lot of the content in the gameat the same time the game feels notably less ambitious than the first game. the story and ideas around the narrative are also a lot more standard fare than previously. this is probably my biggest complaint about the game. i would have preferred an overly ambitious game like the previous installment, even if it meant it would fail to deliver on a lot more ideas. at least then you can lament the missed opportunities and unfulfilled potential. by cutting its own ambition short in the sequel the game has in my mind limited its potential in the first placethis is also felt in a lot of the narrative/worldbuilding ideas which i found cool about the first game - such as the everfall, infinite parallel worlds, cyclical time, will/volition as the driving force of the world - are either left out, glossed over, or unceremoniously mentioned in passing before being written off as if from a checklist. if i played dd2 before ddda i would be thoroughly unimpressed by the setting, which is a shamei would say the narrative of the game is still a cut above your regular high fantasy slop, but just barely. there is a reveal at the end of the game, but it is something of a hidden ending that you might have trouble figuring out by yourself without being familiar with the first game*note on microtransactionsabout the same story as with ddda. you can pay extra to get readily available in game items. there is no reason to do this and it does not give you any real advantage over just playing the game normallymy suspicion is that the mtx are reluctantly included in the release of the game as a way to mollify capcom shareholders, with the predictable outcome of souring the game for a lot of potential buyers instead**note on performancei can only speak for my own setup, but i did initially have some performance issues. these were relatively easy to rectify howeverif you are having issues with performance, try disabling dynamic resolution and fidelityfx super resolution. after i disabled these options the game not only ran a lot better, but also looked a lot betterthe game as it is runs butter smooth on the ""high"" preset for my midrange desktop @1080p. rx 6700 xt, ryzen 5 1600x, and 32gb of ram. i understood your mileage may vary a lot depending on your setup, and for a lot of people playing the game without ray tracing and 4k is out of the question. if you can settle for 1080p then likely you will be just fine with a midrange buildfinally: hire my pawn (id: YLXO7EA22YLB), wolves hunt in packs",1
Positive,"After the first 5 hours of gameplay, I can say that DD2 is indeed what I expected. A worthy successor of DD1.Until now I had no bugs or crashes.The awesome graphics and effects though do come with a high hardware requirement.With a Ryzen 5800x3D and a RTX 3080ti I had to turn raytracing off and set shadows to high for a good ~ 90 fps experience outside of the main town.",1
Positive,"I've been enjoying the game so far. I have played the first game. It's more of what I loved about the original. The microtransactions- well I don't want to see these in any game, but looking at what is in Dragon's Dogma 2, it's actually really minor and these things can be obtained in-game easily. I think don't give it a pass just because of the complaints about these, otherwise you'd be missing out on an excellent game. Just don't buy the items because really the game doesn't require you to in order to progress. I play a lot of MMOs and believe me, the MTX in this game is so insignificant it can be ignored.Performance issues- I have a very fast PC, so didn't have a problem with framerates, but it definitely can use more optimization. I believe these optimization issues can be fixed, and it should improve the performance for others having more issues running their games.Overall, my recommendation is to buy and enjoy the game- just like the first game, this second installment promises many hours of awesome rpg fun!",1
Positive,"This game man, it runs like my dead grandma. Also fuck TAA anti aliasing, wait for performance patches but this games gameplay is amazing so get it when its performance is fixed. The story is really really bad, like its on purpose, the entire point of the game is that every story has a stereotypical cast of peopled designed to fit roles and breaking free for free will and stuff but writing wise it is kinda bad . Also don't be fooled this games micro transactions arent in the way at all, they are completely optional and all the important stuff can be earned in game and its a capcom game, they are whatever. This game also has denuvo which is ass.",1
Positive,"I love the game so far. It is fun, the world feels alive, it has just the right amount of guidance and the pawn system is just amazing. BUT.I hate what Capcom has become, I hate the microtransactions and the extremely bad performance on release. Do not buy this game if you are just over the requirements, it will run horribly in more populated areas.Do not buy this game if you have problems with bad MTX-Practices and want to avoid them (even though you do not need to buy them and can get the stuff ingame)EDIT to original review:The game is amazing. It builds on the first Dragons Dogma and makes every system better. It seems like Capcom is also taking steps in the right direction, and made atleast one of their ""DLCs"" available to get ingame an unlimited number of times.If the game gets more stable/better performance and Capcom continues to make the game better, this will be an amazing game with its ""Dark Arisen""-Type DLC. (which hopefully comes.)",1
Positive,"Character appearance can easily be changed in the capital town. Any resource sold by micro transactions is easily available just by playing. Game is running very well on my RTX 3060ti. The game is gorgeous the quests are well constructed and the combat is very fun, the paw systems is deep and can be extremely interesting to fiddle with.I have no regrets pre ordering the game.",1
Positive,"Check our Curator Page for short reviews. If you wish to get more gaming listings, news, and reviews check our Youtube channel as we release videos there often. Dragon's Dogma is an action-adventure open-world game focused on combat, monster hunting, tactical planning, and intensive, over-the-top difficult combat. Its system focuses on the pawn system, a system used before in the first game where you control, to a certain degree, up to 3 additional pawns that serve as different classes to aid you in combat.The difference this time around is the change in the class system, where we see separations between archer and dual-wielding warriors into two separate classes. It's a nice change in my opinion as it doesn't force you to mainly use blades despite preferring an archer class and vice versa.The combat is intense, a lot more difficult, but feels more realistic. Pawns work together much better this time around, prompting for combo skills, and evolving in experience the further you progress in the world and face different monsters.Physics play a nice role here and can be utilized better in your advantage. It's a lot harder to dodge incoming attacks from large beasts as the hitbox does feel change and the combos not so predictable.Exploration is improved this time around greatly. The world is expansive, rich, full of life, with impressive visuals and places to explore, each carrying interesting places to visit.This game is truly something else. It's so much fun and impressive for what it is. Gorgeous-looking game, with stunning visuals, over-the-top visual effects, and elements that left me surprised at every step. The world is filled with points of interest and attention to detail.This time around we're introduced with some incredible visuals in cinematics that blend excellently with the game and make things fairly seamless. The sound effects are great and give a good sense of impact when striking. Voice acting is fairly good, but not impressive in all regards. I feel there's somewhat a mismatch between exhausting breaths and the voice of my character.Main characters from the story are well-performed. I must remark that the loose language is very well covered by old English expressions, and foul language is well-censored by different expressions that I personally appreciate. The use of old English is interesting in this regard and it's something I don't remember being part of the first game. A step in the right direction. Despite not being heavily focused on the story and more on the experience, this game is a step forward in that area. A lot of the side quests and main quests can be missed or skipped if you truly just wish to see the game to the end. It has 3 potential endings, one being the true and the most interesting endings. The other two, despite one being good, feels somewhat like something is missing. It's a very lengthy game to complete, and so was the first game. Since the developers have said this game is 4x larger, you can expect a good 100+ hours to complete it. Difficulty-wise, it is fairly more balanced in a way considering the fact that there's no difficulty picking, and in Dark Arisen Hard mode, getting hit once is fatal; here, you're still challenged, but with careful positioning and patience, you can pull it off better. Dragon's Dogma 2 is an impressive game and by far one of the best games I've played in 2024. I'm excited to explore and complete this game and share more if ever I change my views on the game. I only wish it would get the fixes in performance it deserves. Other than that, I'd avoid taking people's complaints on the matters they don't understand because except for Denuvo and microtransactions, the game is a gem.",1
Positive,"I have no idea why the game has so many negative reviews here in Steam.The game works just amazing on my Intel i12-50380F core, 150 GB of DDR12 RAM and RTX 9180. Pfffff, just buy yourself a normal gaming desktop, allright?_Okay, I ll add to the review, let s figure it out. I hope it will help you correctly assess the situation with the game and not fall for cheap provocations from people who are used to whining and complaining.Large AAA projects nowadays have 2 major problems: a terrible concept and technical inadequacy. In the first case, the game will be terrible even if it is in excellent technical condition, and the second case is suitable for Dragons Dogma 2The game has one very interesting property: it is simply pleasant and interesting to be in it. The last time I experienced this was in Skyrim, when you even enjoy completing stupid quests in the spirit of fetch and serve.The game world is beautiful, interesting and huge, and the game mechanics and details only emphasize the fact that this is not a game for one playthrough, but a reason to spend every evening in it.Yes, I am very saddened by the poor technical condition, but I believe that this is a matter of improvement, unlike the terrible concept that other games have, but not this one.https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3198096587 _About microtransactionsI don t understand people s whining about this, this is not the case when paid services are aggressively imposed on you, there are plenty of resources in the game and it s very easy to do without them.When people complain that a new save slot costs money, they forget that this was the case in the first game: you couldn't create a new character without deleting the old one, because that was the point of the game. Make choices and bear the consequences for them, rather than save or new game scamming.Moreover, now there are a lot of guides on how to delete your character for free and create a new one, there is no horror here.Therefore, I highly recommend playing this game after its technical state on PC will make it more accessible for all people.https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3196406409 _I also welcome all achievement hunters to check out my 100% Steam achievement guide to add this game to their own collection of completed games, hope this will be useful for you!",1
Positive,"For the love of god please don't listen to the ""microtransaction"" reviews, the game literally has all items available to purchase at in game shops with in-game money and these absolute sheep haven't even bothered confirming that for themselves before writing a dumb review",1
Positive,"I can't say anything about the predecessor because I've never played it!World:Dragon's Dogma 2 features a large open world divided into 2 areas. In the Vermundian north (mostly populated by humans), there is a temperate climate with forests and meadows. There is an elf village here, as well as the human settlements of Melve, Harve, Rest Town and a small garrison. The most impressive thing is the royal city of Vermund with its huge castle.In the barren south of Batthal there is a desert climate and the local population (mostly Biestren) therefore mostly lives in the capital Bakbatthal. However, it is relatively spacious and impressively built.Even further south there is another temperate climate area with the settlements Excavation Site and Volcanic Island Camp.Gameplay:The focus is clearly on the fights and for that we need companions. These are called vassals or pawns.At the beginning we create a companion on a rift stone completely according to our wishes. In addition to the appearance, the personality (aggressive, defensive, voice, etc.) is also set here. Later you can re-customize your character an unlimited number of times (without real money!). The finished character is saved as a kind of copy in the intermediate world (Rift) and can be hired by any other player as often as you like. The original always remains with us. A group can consist of a maximum of four members, two of whom can be hired companions. The system behind it is brilliant. Both our and the hired vassals remember everything they see and experience in their respective worlds. If I hire a companion who knows something from his world (e.g. a cave or treasure that I don't know), then he will offer to guide me there.This function is also useful when leveling up certain badges in the area of monster hunting. I don't have to defeat all the monsters, it's enough if my Pawn was hired by a player and achieved success in his world.Since only our own Pawn can level up in our world, you should replace the hired vassals from time to time and either recruit completely new ones or bring back the old ones (their level has then been readjusted).Fights:There are roughly four main groups for our minions, which are divided into Mage, Fighter, Archer and Thief.The mages are masters of healing, the fighters act as tanks, the archers do ranged damage (good against flying enemies) and the thief is nimble and good at climbing onto enemies.You are not bound to equip your team with all classes. You can also only play with magicians or archers. When a fight breaks out, the Pawns act according to their nature. The more aggressive ones rush at the enemy and the more defensive ones start healing and firing from a distance. It just looks epic when a five meter tall ogre is climbed by several companions and they then ram daggers, swords and/or spears into its neck or head.Later in the game, dragons also fall in a few minutes through teamwork.Wish and conclusion:For the future (DLC's) I would like to see a little more variety in the big monsters and an even bigger world. At the same time, the limit on target crystals would also have to be lifted.Finally, all I can say is that I love the game.The world is big and full of monsters and creatures to hunt. It's a lot of fun to be out and about with your Pawns and explore everything while listening to their conversations. The vassals are always nice and extremely polite, something that is unfortunately becoming less and less important in today's world.",1
Positive,Tragic release. Good game underneath. If you don't want to put up with performance issues then don't pick it up right now,1
Positive,Getting a high five from your pawn after slaying a beast is wroth the price tag of the game alone,1
Positive,i told my wife i was the Arisen and she responded with where are we going master.,1
Positive,"Besides the fps drop,which is horrendous, the microtransactions which can be ignored, because you can acquire them in game (although it isnt really an excuse to have microtransactions) the game overall is amazing! I really love it. it seems harder than the first game, but maybe its a learning curve and i am still very early in the game. The good thing is, you can take your time playing the game and there is no rush. This is coming from someone who doesnt have a lot of time. If you are hesitant for the game, get it on a sale or when they fix the fps drop.",1
Positive,"TLDR: Runs badly, but if you can it is a fantastic game. The ""terrible"" mtx can be earned easily ingame. Long Form: I am the first to criticize stupid publisher practices and give bad reviews on bad moves. But these permanent review bombings paired with straight lies for the gullible are getting out of hand. Let's clear a few things up:1. Yes, the game needs optimization. It's a common problem but since it's mostly playable, it depends on the individual person to decide if it is enough. It was known multiple days from launch, I don't understand the surprise. Btw, Monster Hunter World ran mid too at launch. Where was the shitstorm there? 2. The Microtransactions are ridiculous. But they are the easiest to ignore MTX there can be. The currencies, character change item and fast travel item can be bought ingame from vendors for low prices. Nothing here is ""mandatory"", so stop lying for karma on reddit oder clown points on steam. You aren't ""forced"" to buy one to change your characters appearance. Theres an ingame way of obtaining that.Now let me ask my fellow review bombers one thing: Where were you in the past 8-10 years of capcom games? These MTX aren't new. A few examples? Monster Hunter World: Has these. It even ran badly on launch. On console for example you are truly forced to buy the character change coupon for an existing character. Where was the review bomb? Everyone praises that game and ate that s*** up like hotcakes. Monster Hunter Rise: Has these, too. Where is the review bomb?Resident Evil 4: Praised to high heavens. Guess what. has these Microtransactions too. Where bomb?Look at all hose highly praised modern Capcom games where people even went as far to say they are the best modern PC Publisher. All these MTX are in those games. Why are people mad now? Especially when Dragons Dogma 2 makes it easiest of them all to ignore those?Lets look at something else, that is regarded as best game ever: Baldurs Gate 3 had near unplayable performance and bug issues in the latter half of the game. Where review bombing?Stuff like this is the reason publishers don't take us seriously anymore. And with good right. Look at the steam discussions. Clown Farmers and Trolls on mass. Steam Reviews begin to be worthless too. You did well, guys. You made it harder to actually distinguish good from bad for everyone. Well done.",1
Positive,"I roughly played for 2 hours or so in offline mode.TLDR: a potential good game with one major disgusting flawthe Good- Combat- Character creator (yes, you read it right but wait until the end)- Graphics generallyNeutral- Story so far seems linear but it's too early to say, I will keep it as neutral- UI could be better - Most npcs don't have anything that makes them stand out, again too early to say- Riftstore aka ""the microtransaction shop"" that peeps are enraged about. You can hire official pawns and other players pawns. You pay riftstone to recruit pawns, those upto level 8 are free, beyond that their cost increases as you level up . Your main pawn is free and levels with you so you only have to pay for support pawns. You can also set your pawn to travel with other players and they earn riftstone each time they are used. I am Neutral since I don't really care about it that much.the Bad- Optimisation is bad in populated settlements and your fps gets choppy but it's something almost every game these days come with on launch. Not really a good thing but I hope it will be fixed eventually.the horrible/disgusting- the 2$ character customisation item (one time use). Now this would be normally ""acceptable"" in mmos but has always been something that was present in single player games on launch or added later in a free patch. Trying to monetise on one of the game's attractive elements and the popular selling point is basically pulling another ""Bethesda's paid mods""Anyways, I will play the game until the end for sure and I am very satisfied with my present character but hopefully Capcom rethinks their stance on this, taEdit 1: Few more hours in and I would like to update some of the stuff- Along with the Rift in a certain major settlement, there is a vendor representing the pawn guild (I did not notice him despite walking past that area several times, I am blind). This fella sells some cosmetics and some ultility items, such as the dreadful character customisation item, which is 500 RC in this shop. - I correct my earlier statement that you only get 0 RC pawns until level 8 since I keep running into level 15 ones with 0 RC in the open world, I usually favourite interesting ones for later",1
Positive,"Bad optimization BUT! very funThe micro-transactions are not nearly as bad as people are making them out to be. EVERYTHING you can buy on the micro-transaction store can be earned in game. People are starting to bandwagon HARD and I feel it is unwarranted.Not that I feel the game is flawless. Quite the opposite, but i would like to hold such opinions till I have played more.Please buy with caution but It is a very enjoyable game. Please, think for yourself out there Arisen. Good luck.EDIT: If you liked the first game you will feel at home. Amazing gameplay and story. (Though the story isn't as good as it was in DD1.) I still feel like it is a must buy, a truly amazing game. people who complain about play time haven't actually explored or taken in the world. Slow down not everything is run to the point on the map. there is plenty to discover in this world, slow down and breath. I still 100% recommend. Stay safe out there Arisen.",1
Positive,A great game that will be permanently held back by Capcom's pointless micro-transactions and greed. The dlc items are so incredibly worthless that they aren't even worth 5 minutes of effort in-game. Wakestones can be farmed by hiring pawns and keeping them for 1 day cycle. The campsite and Key are literally something every NPC sells for the price of a couple potions.Character appearance change items are sold by NPC's. You can get RC by killing ghosts at night and generally just playing the game.The fast travel rock is an in-game item you can find (You can only place 10 at a time so it is truly pointless),1
Positive,"Hello! I don't tend to review many games and I certainly don't do them early but I feel like this one needs a review due to the recent review bombs I have seen.Pros:- The Pawn system is interesting, fun and unique- Build Variety - being able to change class at will and experiment is great fun- Exploration - You are really encouraged to explore to uncover secrets which has you playing the game at a more methodical pace- Combat - This is fun and refreshing, action based combat. - Consequences/Side Quests - I enjoy the fact that there are consequences to actions and the side quests are decent. - It doesn't hold your hand which encourages RPG elements such as figuring out some quests (not all as many do still have markers) and making you live with the consequences of your actions which I feel like will add replayability (it does have NG+ )Cons:- Performance in the capital does drop a bit. It is still very much playable for me and doesn't bother me but it is there. The most annoying bit is NPCs popping in. The game is CPU heavy so don't expect graphics to fix it. You will need a higher end PC to play it currently. - Movement is a bit slow, it would have been nice to maybe have a mount or have it where stamina doesn't drain out of combat- Encounters can get repetitive. The game throws enemies at you a lot and since you have to walk everywhere and are slow, you end up fighting the same enemies a lot - Micro-transactions aren't great and I will never condone them but at least you can get all of the paid for items in this game early on. I don't feel a need to buy anything and they haven't unnecessarily slowed down your experience to make you want to buy them like Ubisoft does. Verdict:Is this game for you? It is hard to say. Dragon's Dogma was always a polarising game. It is not like many other RPGs and you shouldn't go into it expecting it to be. If you want to play it safe, you can get the first one in a heavy sale and very cheap to try out the style of game before buying this one. This game doesn't really feel too much like a sequel, in all honesty, and the developer's have even sort of confirmed that it wasn't meant to be. This is more like Dragon's Dogma 1.5 . It is what they envisioned the first one to be but didn't have the technology at the time to make. So, the first one will give you a very good idea. If you are on the fence, I would highly recommend just waiting for a sale before buying and do plenty of research. Maybe watch some let's plays/reviews/critiques but try not to spoil it too much in case you go for it. I'm not entirely sure myself if it is worth the current price tag but I do think it is a good and fun game and is worth playing so long as you understand what you are getting. You can always wait for a price drop and some patches to fix some of the current issues :)EDIT:I have now played the game for a lot longer than I had with my first review. I am still enjoying it massively and think it is worth the price if this is your style of game. I see personally see myself playing this for a very long time!",1
Positive,"DD2 is a genuinely great 7/10 RPG that was hampered by performance issues at launch.OK for starters the story is waaay better than DD:DA and frankly the people saying otherwise have got bad nostalgia goggles. The story in DD:DA is literally a dragon makes a cult to bait you into a fight, there is no intrigue or real side characters in the story. In DD2 most of the complaints about the side characters are from people who did the initial quest and then did not bother to find/do the remainder of their quest-line. Now is DD2 simple? yes. Is that bad? fuck no. It makes me so happy to have a great 60 hour RPG that doesn't really hold your hand and lets you find your own adventure while also providing a solid 7/10 main story. If you are looking for another Baldurs Gate 3, then I'd probably skip this, but if you want a solid as hell 7/10 RPG then hell ya I'd get it. If you are still on the fence, then I would probably wait till DLC comes out and they do a bundle/sale for it.",1
Positive,"NEW EDIT: Had to underclock my GPU and also adjust the voltage. Game is stable now, but it's insane that I have to go into my GPU settings to to have a stable game. Also, game is a damn blast in general.This has to be one of the most poorly optimized PC ports of all time. I have a RX 7900 XTX, Ryzen 9 7900X, and 64 GB of DDR5 ram, and not only is the frame rate awful, but the game crashes all of the time. IT IS UNPLAYABLE! This is absolutely unacceptable especially coming from Capcom. I do not recommend this game right now in its current state. To all of my other AMD brothers and sisters that are having this issue, just ask for a refund.EDIT: Oh and lets not forget about their scummy MTX tactics. They kept them hidden from the store page until the game was released because they KNEW that people would hate them. They claim that everything in the store can be found in-game, but then why put them out for purchase if that's the case? MTX in single-player games baffle me. They shouldn't exist.",1
Positive,"Dragon's Dogma 2 is interesting and different from any other game. It's much closer to immersive sims than traditional RPGs, You are a part of the world, which react to all of your actions you can see it from the start. I tried the first game a few times and never actually stayed to play. The second one grabbed me right away and i can't wait to continue my journey.DD2 is like Adventure: The Video Game you are going on a journey with three NPCs and every step of the way is something magical happens. You just really invested in this world. I didn't feel this way in many years in video games, it's a breath of fresh air in AAA games which 100% focus gropped and try to hold your hand every step of the way.",1
Positive,"If you loved Dragon's Dogma you'll be pleased to know this game is practically that with a new map and new* story. Mechanically speaking I haven't noticed any change from the first game so that's kind of cool. It isn't often a sequel gives me just more of the thing I like. Beastrin or whatever and all the cut concept stuff you've likely seen are nice additions and the map is massive.Runs like ass [DENUVO], crashed on me twice so far, and the micro-transaction shit. That being said nothing that I've noticed exists that you can't personally get in a good 5 minutes or so. Well maybe that extra port crystal, but besides that. So assume that is the lazy man's approach similar to EA and Battlefield. Spending money to shortcut your single player game.It was worth 70 USD to me because I wanted more Dragon's Dogma. That being said I'd wager it isn't worth that value to most unless you are really really into the first game and just want more. DLC and buggy games are pretty par for this industry now unfortunately so while I'd love to thumbs it down I see no reason to on that accord. Play it if you are still itching badly after reading this - if not wait for them to do their job and optimize it a bit better + remove Denuvo after it gets cracked [hopefully]. I genuinely enjoy this game and hope Capcom realizes everyone's gripes lean on the accessory functions they bogged the game with [micro$$$, Denuvo, shit QA testing] and the game itself is awesome.",1

I didn't expect to like it near as much as I do, it truly is something special. I can't wait to sink so much more time into this game.",1
Positive,"Barely played it, but I'll leave this positive review to clarify a lot of misconceptions some people who have never played Dragon's Dogma Dark Arisen have about this title. They are unfairly review bombing it without even understanding how it works.In my PS3, I have played Dark Arisen for at least 300 hours. This is why a lot of the complaints are annoying me, especially the DLC related ones.1. All the items you can buy through microtransactions are obtainable in pretty fair ways through the game. Most of them are quite easy to obtain.2. This is not the first Capcom game to do that. Capcom does this since Resident Evil 2 Remake and Devil May Cry V. The game isn't even balanced with these DLCs in mind, they usually make the game too easy. If you are not the audience who wants to make the game laughably easy, these DLCs are not for you.3. Most of this DLC controversy comes from the fact casual gamers can't fathom the fact that someone made a game that tries to make fast travel situational in 2024. They noticed you could buy portcrystals (ONE of the items required for a sucessiful fast travel) and freaked out. They assumed Capcom was basically selling ""fast travel"" as a DLC. This is just wrong.4. I'll clarify how portcrystals work: they are positionable items that ""create"" fast travel points. However, to actually use them, you need ferrystones. Ferrystones are not cheap in the early game and you won't be using them when you have more feasible options like using carriages or simply walking when it's not that far. The game is structured like STALKER and a lot of organic situations happen during the trip, and the game wants you to engage with them while travelling. This is why fast travel isn't something the game gives to you like Skyrim or some shit.5. Dragon's Dogma Dark Arisen gave you a lot of portcrystals and apparently 2 is not being unfair on that department too. The DLCs are an early boost akin to DMCV or RE2 Remake's DLCs. You REALLY don't need them.6. The other items, like PLAYER/PAWN CUSTOMIZATION, are obtainable rather early in the game. You shouldn't even worry about these complaints.If you enjoy games like Monster Hunter, Elden Ring and Morrowind, you'll like this one. The mechanics are really unique and the whole idea behind the game is being a ""travel simulator"". Bring the correct resources and plan your trip properly. Dragon's Dogma 2 also brought some STALKER elements to the mix, and the world is organic, which means there's a degree of unpredictability to your trips. If you play Dragon's Dogma for what it truly is instead of expecting fucking Skyrim 2 or The Witcher 4, you'll come around and enjoy it.Shit, it's frustrating how you can't release unique games anymore in the AAA sphere without the risk of triggering a mass of casuals who do not understand your gameplay loop. Truly disappointing for me as someone who waited since my teenage years for this sequel.",1
Positive,"Capcom in recent years is a company that does not disappoint and increasingly gives us better games and adventures to enjoy and in this case we have Dragons Dogma 2.11 hours of adventures, missions, farming, new items, equipment.Incredible things about Dragons Dogma 2:- The story: Our protagonist is Arisen and as soon as we start the game everyone will recognize us for our past and our deeds.- The world: An incredible place to explore as much as we want and it is full of enemies, allies, vegetation and everything you can imagine without leaving empty areas with nothing.- The combat is super satisfying and sometimes you will notice that you need new equipment because there are enemies so strong that just touching you will send you flying.- The pawn system to hire up to 2 (There is you, your partner and 2 others that you can change whenever you want at a price depending on the level, of course)- All the variety of enemies and bosses.Problematic things about Dragons Dogma 2:- The saving system: You go to settings and click save and continue. It does not have slots to make manual saves and if you miss a mission it is difficult to go back to restart it or choose a manual save.- Performance: Fps drops in all parts of the game and stuttering (Patch 1 - 29/03/2024 - They fixed many issues) And about the DLCs, the truth is that NO ONE FORCES YOU to buy them and you can get them by playing (buying in the stores in the cities and doing missions)",1
Positive,"Dragon's Dogma 2 is literally the most fun i've had with a single player experience since Elden Ring came out.Performance is fine, just struggles a bit when in densely populated areas such as the cities, which will be patched sooner rather than later. Outside of that though, it's pretty much always smooth.The presence of microtransactions in this game is scummy for sure, but you absolutely don't need to pay a single penny to get the full experience. Microtransaction items can be acquired by simply playing the game and exploring. People are making it a bigger deal than it is, they've had MTXs like this in every other Capcom game. Blame the higher ups at Capcom.This game is absolutely fantastic and it's release is being marred by a bunch of rage-baiting, negative nancies. I guarantee if you check this game out, you won't be dissapointed.",1
Positive,"I dodged every bad review, every spoiler, and every possible opinion someone might've had for this game. It's an RPG, so I gave it a try. And by the gods, I was not expecting this. In 3 days I've spent 34.6hrs in this game. 3 Days. That's roughly 48% of 3 days, in a single game. I grinded the fuck out of it, I am enthralled, it feels like playing Baldur's Gate 3 again, except I don't have to wait for the new patch of BG3 to come out.The combat is out of this world, the sheer size of the map, and density of everything in it is insane. So many quests, hidden tidbits, collectibles, perks, items, it feels like a completionist's dream. And I turned into one here. Rarely do I ever bother with 100%ing anything. But this one is gonna have to be one of the 100% for me.Also, if you ever see Faith as a pawn to hire, please treat her well, she's my baby alright?",1
Positive,"Here's what I'll say about Dragon's Dogma 2 after seeing a bunch of comments. The design philosophy of this game has way more in common with games like Wizardry and Might & Magic and Daggerfall than it does something like the Witcher 3 or Baldur's Gate 3. Set your expectations as such.This is very much more of a modern action take of a dungeon crawler, and it absolutely succeeds at that. The main story is meant more as a tool to move you through the world and give the player a victory condition, than be the main center piece of the game. The center piece is combat and exploration.I absolutely loved it. My performance issues have been fixed after the first patch.The MTX drama is a giant nothing. It's the same thing Capcom has been putting in all their games for over a decade now. It's a bunch of easily obtainable items in game, if you just play the game - you will be drowning in the items naturally.",1

Positive,I absolutely love the Dragon's Dogma series. These games are weird but in a good way. A bit rough around the edges maybe but with a lot of charm and very unique design that's unlike anything else out there.I do hope the game gets some content DLC and future sequels. No idea if the latter is even possible now though since the creator of the series has left Capcom.,1
Positive,"I'm going to explain exactly how stuff works so bear with me here.Ignore the negative reviews about microtransactions and having to pay $2 to edit your character.These are coming from people that have no clue what they are talking about and are gut reacting with no knowledge of how the game systems work.Hi, I played the hell out of the first game back when I was still on console and things were the same back then, so let me go over a few things:1) Rift crystals are an in game currency that allow you to hire pawns that are a higher level than you.There are microtransactions for them but they are not needed whatsoever. Yes Capcom is kinda scummy for including them but they have had similar MTX in most of their games and they are never needed. They are there simply to monetise whales who don't know how easy things are to get.You get rift crystals all the time whenever your pawn is hired by someone else. More than enough to hire any pawn you like within a reasonable level scale from your own. You can also hire friends pawns for free no matter how high level they are. This created a whole community in DD1 where people actually put great effort into their pawns so they would be fun to play with and worth hiring, and we made a lot of friends in the process.2) Monetised Wakestones (revives)Again, these are got from completing quests with other peoples pawns. They are extremely common.The MTX are again just to monetise whales.3) $2 to edit your characterNonsense. Again there's an MTX for it, but you can purchase the item needed to edit characters in game for rift crystals, which as I've explained are really easy to get just from normal play when people hire your pawn.Am I condoning Capcom's blatant MTX peddling? No. However for anyone that has played a Capcom game in the last 15 years you will know how pointless they are. They've done this for years. They monetise the most basic things that nobody in their right mind would ever in a million years need to buy, but people do for some reason, so they pander to them.If you play DD2, you will never EVER need to spend a single penny on MTX. Everything the MTX give are extremely common, and any veterans of DD1 will tell you the same thing.As for the game its self, it runs perfectly fine on my RTX 2080 super.I have made a custom graphics preset with mostly maxed settings even with RTX on and the game runs smooth as butter.The combat is fluid as ever and I can't say enough how much I've missed it after not having played the first one in years.There's not much to dislike at all about the actual game. You can dislike Capcom, but in terms of actual gameplay, what I've played so far has been great, and I can only imagine based on how it's progressing compared to the first game, it feels just like the old days, and I imagine it's just going to keep getting better.In short, if you want to make a stand and vote with your wallet over Capcom's MTX stuff, don't buy it.They've not changed in about 15 years so I doubt they will care.If you want to play the sequel to one of the best hidden gem RPGs ever made though, buy it, play it, enjoy it.A game like Dragon's Dogma doesn't come around very often.",1
Positive,Fix the performance and its GOTY 2024,1
Positive,"$70 for this unstable money grab. I have never seen a game without start new game ever in my life. Capcom should be ashamed of this bs tactics of selling a expensive game, locking you out of basic features with micro-transactions and doesn't run properly hahaha I want some of what they're smoking Edit:That said the game is really good and fun though. Ok they added the ability to start a new game., still plenty to fix but I'm changing my opinion to recommended now. Having way too much fun with this game.",1
Positive,"Dragon's Dogma 2 is an Action RPG set in a seamless open world with no loading screens. It has a very distinct approach to open world game design and chooses not to provide too many quest markers, waypoints and other modern open world conventions. This results in an immersive experience yet the focus is very much on action. The game has no difficulty options and it doesn't feel like it is setting out to punish the player, but its rigid save structure (one auto-save slot, and one regular save slot) does create a palpable tension to most encounters. The auto-save works well and you don't lose too much time if you need to retry an encounter.In the first section of the game you will feel vulnerable and the world will feel imposing - but by the endgame it has become a true power fantasy where you are an unstoppable force with many different abilities and classes to choose from.The combat encounters feel fresh because everything in the game world adheres to the same physics, this translates very well to the larger enemies who might struggle maintaining their balance when standing on difficult terrain or when you hit them with a powerful attack. Everything has weight and physicality to it which is important to keep you engaged. The dynamic nature of the AI and the open world without loading scenes makes for an interesting mix where you could be engaged in combat, when suddenly another larger enemy decides to intervene and before you know it you are in an epic battle with gigantic enemies, multiple NPC's, random pawns and smaller enemies - all fighting each other. It can get really hectic.In many ways I hope the next Monster Hunter game takes some ideas and features from Dragon's Dogma 2 combat encounters, that is high praise for an open world game.There is a way to fast-travel by using limited portstone items (these can be found in the game world or purchased in the shops with in-game currency). These will let you warp to portcrystals you can place wherever you want, allowing you to create your own fast-travel network. By the end of the game I had 5 or 6 of these, which was more than I ended up needing.This limitation on fast travel means that this game is all about the journey. It wants you to walk from point A to point B, and if you're like me you will always prefer walking - the scale of the map feels just right and there is always something to explore nearby. I spent 130 hours on my first run and I didn't explore everything yet.There is controversy around the MTX that offers an additional fast-travel point and in-game currency, however this has no effect on the game design. You can get everything in-game without spending real money, and none of it is behind a grind. The MTX is there for those that wish to pay for a cheat. The same exact MTX model has been present in every major Capcom release in the last fifteen years, and it didn't stop games like Resident Evil 4 Remake or Monster Hunter World from being very well regarded.The presentation is incredible if you are able to max the settings. The lighting model looks gorgeous - and raytracing is used to good effect. Like Dragon's Dogma 1, this game has true darkness during night time - sometimes all you can see is the glint in an enemy's eye. Physics during combat are immaculate and even larger enemies will always 'position' themselves in the game world correctly. Larger enemies are prone to losing their balance when perched on a slope, and they will try to avoid falling over. Large and small, each entity realistically adheres to the game's physics system making everything feel consistent and weighted.The photo mode is very limited, and I hope they improve on it in a future update.In my 150 hours playing I had one crash, the game performed at a rock solid 60fps 90% of the time. However the largest towns saw drops to 45fps. But when a dragon started attacking the city and 20+ guards/NPC's joined in the fight with me - that framerate never dropped further so it never became unplayable for me. In the open world, even during the most intense combat scenes with multiple giant enemies, many NPC's and smaller enemies, all sorts of spells going on at the same time - it never dropped. However, please mind your specs. This is very much a 'current gen' game with big ambitions.Some observations and notes below: You will run into AI NPC's and AI pawns throughout your adventure in the open world. They will be fighting with monsters, coming to your aid, or just walking by to greet you. If something happens in the area they will always respond to the situation. None of these NPC's are random. They all have a name and a face. They will all have a town they call home, if they are travelling merchants they will follow their usual route - and you may encounter them arriving or leaving the town you are in. Monsters will get into fights with other types of monsters, you can see this happening in the far distance - one time I thought a fellow traveler was in trouble and I ended up rushing to the aid of a goblin.was in a dungeon and noticed an AI pawn heading toward the exit, when I ventured deeper into the dungeon I noticed the boss enemy was already missing a big chunk of its HPWhen a NPC dies in a dungeon, you will have to resurrect them yourself - or visit the local mortuary to have them resurrected before they are buried and lost forever.When you dismiss a pawn in your party they won't just vanish on the spot, they will walk away in their own direction and they will continue to be aware of their surroundings. I think they walk all the way to a pawn summon point.NPC's in town are all unique, and don't just stand in place - many or all of them have their own routines. You will also bump into previously dismissed pawns along your journey - who will remember you. Local NPC's may also comment on your quest specific actions if you happen to talk to them. They will respond to changes in the weather, time of day, etc.Hang out in a tavern for a while and you might see a brawl break out if someone bumps into another. You can intervene (I picked one of them up and carried them outside) but the slap fight continued.If a NPC falls in love with you they will seek you out - follow you - and get in fights with other admirers for your attention. It seems some have also lost affection to me over time, but I have no idea what triggered that.Your pawns may know about quests you are on and can help guide you and offer advice to your quest. The game uses this as a waypoint/hint system - and your pawns will actively encourage you to recruit another pawn that might be more familiar with the chosen quest.If you rest in a tavern your main pawn will synchronize with the server and if it was hired by another player, will tell you about its experiences in that other reality. They can get semi-permanent scars from these encounters if they go bad.Try picking up a rabbit and throwing it at your pawns! You can play a game of catch with them and they will comment on it. If you fall from a high place they might also be able to catch you before you hit the ground.Cities can be attacked by monsters, when this happens you can have 20-30 AI guards and other NPC's help fight the enemies alongside you. This is quite impressive and ambitious - especially when one of the bigger monsters decides to rampage a large city - it is pure chaos.If you get attacked by a flying monster, try holding on and climbing on its back. If it decides to fly away it can take you all the way back to its nest across the map. You can also summon harpies with the right item and force them to fly you to otherwise hard to reach places.Venturing out into the world will just have a lot of random stuff happen - that moment in Morrowind where a mage falls from the sky to its death, right in front of you? I had that happen to me in this game - except it was completely unscripted.",1
Positive,This is an update after completing the True Ending of the game and I absolutely loved the true ending. I think it is the best of the 3 endings then there is supposed to be a good ending which i could've chosen at end but i chose to do the true ending. there is also supposedly a bad ending as well.The game runs great on my RTX 3060 with 12 GB VRAM and my intel CPU from last year. I also have 32 GB of RAM. so my system easily handled all high settings at 1080 p with fps at set 60. I also had ray tracing on.Every micro-transaction in the store I have been able to easily obtain in game. I think the only thing i could not get was the deluxe pre-order pendant which makes sense because it was a deluxe pre-order special thing.The game is extremely fun and the combat is the best . I loved the different vocations and found it easy to level up many of them. I am still working on the vocations that i usually do not play. Seems to me the magic archer and mystic spear are the best for me in game. I have has super fun with both those vocations.If you do true ending you get a very nice surprise which I will not spoil.Overall love the game. The monsters are varied and as you progress they change what the monsters do and their difficulty goes up as you get stronger. I only wish they would scale up the difficulty for new game plus because enemies become to easy to beat in new game plus. I also hope to see an expansion that adds end game content like the island did in the first game with tougher enemies. If they fix issues with optimization and any crashing for the people who do meet specs then the games definitely one of the best this year.Easily an 8/10 for me and would be a 10 if they fix the issues and add the suggested increased new game plus difficulty and end game content.,1
Positive,"So we finally got the sequel and with all the promises and hype that this is the ""definitive"" vision of what the director intended the 1st game to be , we then finally got play it and it does some things better, some things worse and some things are exactly the same-ish as before which result in more of a side-step than a step forward for DD. The game is about on par to the original release of DD1 (so not counting the dlc) in terms of total quality.You'd think after so many years and the project getting more time and money this finally would've been the definitive Dragons Dogma game to come but it's not really, it's still really fun and anyone who enjoyed DD1 is still gonna enjoy this despite the present problems but more was to be expected from a long awaited sequel, a proper upgrade to DD1 and not a side step really. What's better ? - Visually it is clearly far better but that is a given for like 10 years difference in tech , i especially love the lighting and foliage in this one, grass,trees all shake in really nice ways during combat , especially when fighting giant monsters that have a heavy impact on how the fauna reacts to their heavy stomps. Only issues is the water reflections are very messy, have some weird pix-elation issues relating to screen space reflections which is often a given problem that the RE engine suffers from.- Combat is a lot more satisfying and fun especially when fighting giant monsters where it can feel down right cinematic more so than the original DD1, though it can suffer from some occasional annoying camera control issues, especially in tighter corridors- Exploration is far better in this game, there is more to explore and see in comparison to DD1- Pawns seem to have more dialog and interactions with you and between other pawns, often commenting what their own master does and how they play, in general they love to gossip a lot, however the issue of repeating dialog is very still frequent despite the director saying that constant repeating lines would go away which is not the case, prepare to listen to pawns point at the same ladder for 60 hours in a town.- The New Mystic Spear class is pretty cool, starts of a bit weak but as soon as you get access to the bubble shield he can put up on himself and allies , he then starts rocking hard-More races yay, well one whole new race, we now get to play as Khaj- i mean beastrens , they're pretty cool cat people, though i wish there was lizard folk too to pick-Character creator is even better than before, among the best character creation tools I've seen What's on par ?- Story writing is about the same-ish as before, not much of an improvement despite the director claiming we'd see a substantial improvement in story telling, at best it is mildly better but realistically it is about on par which wasn't that great to begin with in DD1- Romance system is silly and convoluted as it was in DD1 What's worse ?- Though the general combat of melee,bow and what not has been improved, the spell casters however saw them selves getting rather limited with far less spells in their arsenal and less spells to assign to for active use , they're still decently fun but definitely the lesser vocations to pick, i suggest going for vocations that are not caster class (Mage and Sorcerer) at least from my personal experience, I'd also highly recommend thief which is incredibly fun.- One of the two new classes that replaced Mystic Knight and Assassin is more of a meme class that is not really all that great to play and that is the trickster which rellies on just creating illusion to distract enemies while your pawns do the work, it is a interesting unique ide but it just was not that well executed, it needed better and more interesting illusions spells and buffs to play with.- The game is too over saturated with enemy encounteres, often it feels like you can barelly take 2 steps before another group of gobblins,wolves and harpies show up to fight which can hurt exploration to a degree cause it can get tiresome how much fighting happens even to just check out a small section somewhere on the map- Smaller enemy variety, the enemy roster is smaller in comparison to DD1 , it is still decently sized but by the end you will start feeling tired of killing the same enemies over and over with at most minor cosmetic/gameplay changes to them near the end. -Somehow they made the save system worse and far more prone to getting a player to lose progress if they get soft locked by accident-No hard modeOutside of the direct DD1 vs DD2 Comparisson, the other major note of an issue is optimisation, this is the first time an RE Engine game ran this poorly, usually the engine is known for being incredibly well optimised with the previous games that used it running really well but here, my fps can be as low 30 to as high as 120 depending on areas and what is happening, sometimes seemingly for arbitrary reasons ill see hefty drops in fps but the most consistent places where fps drops is when a lot of friendly npcs are arround, especially in the capital. Final thoughts ?I guess as i said at the start, DD2 is a rough around the edges diamond, just like DD1 it combines elements from a bunch of fun games, it has the climbing and fighting on big monsters from Shadows Of The Colossus and a melee combat system somewhat aching to DMC slightly , a fairly generic fantasy setting but with an interesting twist in the story that does get recycled here again so it is not a new twist for DD1 veterans and of course the pretty original pawn system that no other game has mimiced yet where you make a companion character that other players can hire to hang with and said companion (pawn) can learn from you and other players some behaviourist, likewise you can hire other peoples pawns too in your adventure.Right now, for the 65 euros it is asking imo kinda too much, either wait for a light discount or check out if a 3rd party store has a better price, i paid 43 euros which felt like a good deal and i was happy with that price point with what i got, even with the frame rate issues and the fact it has some notable design flaws. So, it's not a bad game at all, it's a pretty damn fun game actually , just like DD1 but just like DD1 it's a flawed gem and i wish it wasn't the case again that instead we got a sequel that was better in every way.",1
Positive,"The Long Dark makes my GPU, sweat! 'what are you talking about'; you sayThere's a certain % I play on my laptop's. then some on my DESKTOPS. Depending on the game, I analyze how it makes my GPU, WORK. OH you have a WEAK GPU, you say, my friend, YES, for Long Dark, it's weak, why does Long Dark make my GPU, work so much, BUT THIS DOESN'T -it's a 4060 laptop 32 GIGABYTES ram with an unlocked i7The fan's kick in.

CONFIRMED,If you're within the limits of your VRAM. I rarely heard my LAPTOP fans heat up, like they do so often. (TLD)This is a wonderful RPG fantasy story, played in 3rd person with deep lore & IT IS A SEQUELFOR ALL THE GAME IT IS-I RECOMMEND.On the hardware side - 'scratches head'. Amazing well.UPDATES ON THE WAY-OKKKK ;)",1
Positive,"Game of the year, only smudged by the appearance of micro transactions you can safely ignore, since everything is attainable in game, and not important. It's the sequel I've waited eagerly for, for over a decade. I recommend it if you always wanted a more action RPG experience.",1
Positive,"Yet another case among the hundreds of games deserving of the line: ""I wish there was a neutral recommendation option""Dragons Dogma 2 is at it's best Dragon's Dogma 1 with better combat, and at it's worst it's a rushed mild disappointment that just hurts at how close it was to being amazing. It's a side-grade really.The game is very front-loaded. Playing the game for the first 10-ish hours you might be thinking ""holy fuck this game is incredible"", but as soon as you cross over the very obvious ""second half"" point of the game you will discover that said second half is very boring and the story content becomes rushed or at times non-existent. The first half/ biome sets up a ton of really interesting plotlines that you expect to be elaborated on further, but they never are, and I shit you not, once you cross over into the second half of the game it becomes ""go to the new city > go to the castle > go investigate a ruin > alright time for the ending fight"". If you're not doing side content you can finish the game from this point within like maybe a few hours. This wouldn't be so bad if the side content didn't get so boring so quickly. You will discover very fast that you can't walk 5ft in the world without encountering a goblin camp, a pack of lizard men, or a pack of wolves. These are the only 3 common basic enemies in the world. There's lizard and goblin variant types/ races that can be a bit different to kill but that's it. Otherwise the rest of the enemies are the same wandering mini-bosses like ogres, golems, metal golems, minotaurs, and griffins. They don't even include the enemies and other bosses from the first game such as the giant rooster.The ""end-game"" portion does end up being really cool visually and atmospherically, it feels like you're in a Berserk style apocalypse, but it's sadly really short and is composed of timed boss fights that are pretty cool, but again it's short lived. You CAN stay in the end-game as long as you want once you beat the bosses but nothing really changes besides there's more undead wandering the world.That said, the combat and gameplay is peak. There can be SOME issue with the combat, such as vocations having less ability slots compared to 1, but I enjoyed combat much more than DD1. Visually the game is stunning. Performance-wise the game kind of blows in the first city, but otherwise it was solid throughout (and the most recent patch apparently helped a ton, though I haven't played the game in months). The first half of the game ""Vernworth"" is incredibly fun and interesting to explore, and the second half is initially pretty cool but again, you'll be met with disappointment if you managed to care about the story at all.I'm going to actually recommend it on a decent sale. I enjoyed my time with it a lot but I wish it was much more than it currently is. If I could, I would really rate this in the middle, but since I lean more positive I'll recommend.As for whether this is better than DD1, or which one to get. eh.DD1 is usually cheaper at least, and the story can be pretty interesting, but the combat is a bit rough at times.So it's really up to you. My current recommendation is to get DD1 really cheap, play it, if you really loved it and want more of pretty much the exact same game with more fluid gameplay (but ultimately not an upgrade or downgrade), then get DD2. I spent about 60 hours in total with these games across about 2 weeks and it was absolutely worth it, they are very good action adventure RPGs.",1
Positive,"I made an initial review and felt the need to completely redo it now that I've got some hours in this game under my belt. This is gonna be a long one but I think it's worth a read. Thanks ahead of time to those who take the time to do so. There may be slight SPOILERS, so you've been warned.Pros:1) Feels like Dragons Dogma of old at the best of times, it really is great. Especially within early-game. They set the tone and it keeps up until Dragons start pestering you a lot more towards the end of the game.2) Fairly decent rebind options even on controller (which you will need to do if you want muscle memory from the first game to mean anything in this game). Keyboard users get inherent advantages and some of the game's design really benefits controller use for quality of life stuff. Win/Win here.3) Different isn't always better but I think they've managed to strike a good balance in that respect. Actions feel like they have weight. This can be emphasized when playing Archer and Thief especially so.4) Classes definitely feel different and can appreciate some of the implemented limitations, like Archers using only bows rather than Striders from DDDA using daggers and bows. Makes the gameplay feel more interesting imo. This opens up in a certain way later into the game.5) It has the makings of being the best character creator based, fantasy RPG game for the next 10 or more years, just needs to fix its problems ASAP before it catches any more flak.Not a Pro or Con:- Class Balancing is. lacking in many areas. Some are FAR, far better than others and the ones at the bottom really tend to feel it, even with good gear. For some, this is a ""W"", others an ""L"". As a mage, I drew the shortest stick lol.Cons:1) Performance (Mods have done far more for this part than the DLSS patch could have hoped to achieve lol)2) Denuvo (literally a waste of their time and ours. Especially because it isn't stopping people from cheating, just making everyones life hell at times lol)3) Mage/Sorcerer feel very underpowered compared to Archer and Warrior. Magick Archer is fairly good but still a fair bit worse than Archer for single target damage. Magick casting classes, particularly sorcerers, NEED to have that high damage reward for long cast times and stamina. Removing the quick cast feature but making the spells do WAY more damage would help in this regard, MAYBE. Unfortunately, the large monster fights aren't balanced in this regard so it'd make sorcerer super hard to play well.4) Chip damage abuse by enemies. Dullahan specifically. Not sure what they were thinking here but Dullahan has a combo where he'll CC trap you and then ""force grab"" you with his head magick, ticking your Max Health down to nothing super fast. Very frustrating, time-wasting experience that just puts a sour note on the fight and the game. Refuse to fight them at all now for fear of having to rest and waste buff food.5) Enemy groups can perpetually stagger you to death in medium to large size groups with no way out. This is true for every class except Fighter/Warrior, where you can seemingly poise your way through some hits with augments and rings.6) Large Enemies, particularly Dragons, force massive consumable and wakestone use due to nearly unavoidable dive attacks and AoEs like Bolide spam. Cannot interupt their spell casting with any spellcaster ability that I've used. Archers and Warriors get EZ mode here. No real skill expression possible when shit is unavoidable or spam'd with no possibility of interrupting them.7) Enemies spawning based on camera position/occlusion, causing fights to seemingly occur every 20-30 seconds out in the wild and causing your pawns to say ""we cannot drop our guard!"" like they're scolding you lol. Not my fault that huge pack of goblins poofed into existence just out of view.8) Game reminiscient of RE4 Remake in terms of how it feels compared to DDDA. Constant anxiety and un-abatable chaos. RE4 Remake made it so no amount of mastery over the game will change that with their dynamic difficulty system. I think they're using Dynamic Difficulty in this game too, with spawns. Could be wrong here. DD2 isn't quite as bad but I get seriously similar vibes sometimes. This seems to be a game philosphy change within CAPCOM and I'm honestly not a fan.This concludes my points of praise and criticism. That said, I highly recommend playing this game as there's nothing really quite like it. If you're not sure about the full price, wait until its on sale and go play Dragon's Dogma Dark Arisen for much less money instead until then.",1
Positive,Its like Skyrim with good gameplay.,1
Positive,"Hi Capcom, If you only allow one save file, please don't make this game crash regularly. And this game couldn't run smoothly on my $5000 PC.",1
Positive,"It makes me feel sad seeing how people review bombing a game that was waited for many years and it became another game with having ""Mostly Negative"" right on the release, after playing the game for 4 hours i must say that i really enjoyed playing on the first hours, the first thing i noticed is the lack of ""New Game"" option which is not understandable why it should be removed and being added later, every game needs to have the New Game option. The second thing i noticed is that the performance is quite bad especially its very noticable on cities and i hope Capcom will do something about it, outside the cities the FPS goes smooth sometimes and sometimes drops but its not a big deal for me. And of course one of the main things its getting reviewbombed is the Microtransactions.I dont understand all these complains about MTX in this game because first of all all these items shown on DLC list are all obtainable in game and there's definitely no item that is not available to get in game and second.people forget that Capcom also were adding stuff to buy to make the game easier for those who struggle with farming like Red Orbs in DMC5 and DMC4, Weapon vouchers upgrade in RE4 Remake and Character creation ticket in MHW(Which is one of items that actually needs to be purchased as it is not earnable in MHW) and many more stuff and people weren't even complaining about this and yet here everyone get to complain like its the first time Capcom adding this :/I don't really have any reason to leave a negative review to this game because i liked the game, of course there are problems with the performance and lack of NG option but i'm sure this all will be fixed in next updates so i really hope the game will start to have positive reviews very soon.",1
Positive,"Very rewarding combat and exploration. Feels like a true adventure while maintaining action-rpg gameplay. It's hard to compare to anything other than DD1. I think it's great and probably a 9 out of 10 for me as is.There is a lot of misinformation about the game. Here's some corrections to info you've heard:Fast travel is not very expensive in the late game (when you actually want to fast travel). However, the game is about exploration and being on an adventure. If you don't want to embark on an adventure and rather just click a location to be there, you will not enjoy most of the game.You don't have to buy any of the DLC to remake your characters or access any game functions. This isn't something like Monster Hunter World where there's over $540 of DLC, most of which is paywalled cosmetic assets that are there to exploit OCD people.The game's performance has been patched many times now. For context, I see one stutter every few hours I play on max settings while recording with obs and having several chrome tabs open. Compare that to Elden Ring at max settings where you see stuttering almost constantly and you'll understand how hypocritical people are when complaining about performance in video games (especially comparing how long it has been out in comparison).It is unfortunate that Itsuno seems to always be time and budget constrained by Capcom. I kinda wish he and his team would leave Capcom and do a kickstarter to build a new studio/game. Capcom's anti-consumer business practices (like adding microtransactions to EVERYTHING - even giants like resident evil) have just gone too far in the last decade or so imo.",1
Positive,"Dragon's Dogma 2-Starting with the actual issue here -> Performance. It has issues. Cities and towns have their drops.Some tweaking can help, openworld is mostly fine, so let's hope for a patch.The ""issues"" MTX. you can edit your character in game by doing a quest, (you can aquire it as much as you like), takes 5 - 10min. You don't need to buy a single item with real money it is ALL in game.I'm not defending the option for people to buy these items. it is stupid, but don't spread lies about this being the only option. it IS NOT.i never review like this where i actually call out other reviews. But it's becoming more rediculous each year.-Now for the game itself.Fantastic combat system, awesome world and a well designed quest system.Dragon's Dogma 2 is a improved dragon's dogma 1. And it shows.The pawn system is still awesome to use and the world is HUGE.Story (right now) is interesting, and i'm excited to see where it's heading.DD2 looks to be a phenominal hardcore RPG experience, no hand holding, exploration !A fantastic sequel and a must play for fans of the game and genre.Enjoy the game !",1
Positive,"Combat is really fun and gets better as you get more skills for you and your pawn. The landscapes are very pretty and the interactions with your pawns make the adventures that much more fun. I killed a harpie by landing on it when i forgot the impale input, one of the funniest things I've seen. My only gripe is the performance in major towns tbh. Game runs great otherwise after tweaking the settings a little but will be even better when performance patches help fix the issues. You can get all the optional micro-transactions in-game by playing and exploring the map, if you are lazy and want stuff now then there you go I guess, it's a single player game so you play how you want.",1
Positive,Runs at a steady 60 for me at 2k until i get into a populated area. then it dips to about 50. Over all what I was anticipating with the console locked at 30fps. I hope we get optimizations soon so everyone else can have a similar or better experience too.,1

Positive,"I'm going to give this a positive review with a asterisk* with the intention of updating this to negative if things aren't fixed, as I feel like Capcom is usually good at patching their games and fixing issues. This game review section comes off really weird to me, massively negative, as if some huge influencer got a bunch of people to review bomb the game, not even sure these guys have played the game let alone played the previous Dragon's Dogma. THE BIGGEST NEGATIVES SO FAR.1. FRAMERATE ISSUES - holy crap these can be bad. I have a beefy computer and it doesn't matter how good your computer is because there are certain spots in the game that have massive issues. Random hills, random spots, and TOWNS are the big one, BIG DIPS, we're talking smooth as butter to sub 30 fps dips very abruptly. This needs to be fixed, and soon.2. MICROTRANSACTIONS - MTX for a single player game will always be a negative, full stop. I will say though, I looked through the MTX and these are all things you can get pretty easily in game, most of those things I already have in my inventory in less than 6 hours of game time. Buying Rift Crystals is 100% not necessary, in fact if anything the MTX is SHADY because people who have never played the game wouldn't know that these items are completely unimportant or necessary. Just play the game and use the pawns, you will get Rift Crystals and Items. The MTX is still a negative though. Just level up your main character and every pawn at your level or below will cost literally ZERO Rift Crystals.3. SAVE GAME - You're only allowed one save game for an big RPG where you're probably gonna want multiple characters to mess around with. Even Monster Hunter has like 3 Save Files, feels extremely outdated and bad in 2024.GOOD THINGS1. This feels like the next Dragon's Dogma game, in a good way. If you loved the first game, you will probably like this game a lot, even with the weird tech issues that will probably get fixed in due time.2. Character creation is crazy detailed and cool. 3. Pawn system is awesome, lots of creative people making awesome characters / meme characters, and it provides a really unique experience for a game.4. The game actually feel's less ""Arcadey"". As someone who has played through the first game multiple times this game feels a lot more methodical with it's use of abilities and actions. You can't really just spam moves, sometimes you can, with big openings, but positioning and knowing when to use abilities has even greater impact than the first game. In fact the pacing of the game seems to be a lot slower and more immersive than the first. 5. Big Bosses are back and still awesome.6. BEAUTIFUL game, the game is gorgeous running on my PC, if they fix these framerate issues, it's gonna be perfect.7. Quest system seems a lot more exploration based than most RPG's, it wants you to really take your time and look around for people who might need help.I think a lot of my confusion comes from people who have clearly never played Dragon's Dogma before as all the systems that were in the first game are here as well and more. It's so weird, the MTX is bad, but none of those items are even remotely necessary or even hard to come by in game, again I have most of those items in less than 6 hours. It's just weird decisions by the developers, obviously they are trying to squeeze people who have no clue.DO NOT listen to a lot of the people on here complaining about the MTX, the technical issues are the biggest thing full-stop that will lessen your enjoyment of the game. I will update this review to negative if the games technical issues aren't fixed in a timely matter.FIRST UPDATE:So the game has been patched a little bit. Having experience most of the game (60+hours ish) I can say with confidence that this is basically a soft-reboot of the first game. Lots of extremely and uncannily similar locations and ideas. I think this game is basically a hyper-expanded version of the first game with both super good and bad changes. There's DEFINITELY not enough enemy/boss variety. The quests are pretty lacking and there are lot of quests that basically put you on a timer but don't necessarily express that. I have just entered the post-game and will update again when I feel like I've ""completed"" the game. I will say without spoilers that the post-game is only accessible through essentially a puzzle that let's you progress past the soft-ending through a specific choice and action, otherwise the game ""ends"", but this choice unlocks an actually integral and huge gameplay/story component.So far though, my biggest criticisms of the game come down to the need for way more bosses and mobs, and that you get waaaay too overpowered very quickly. If you spend a decent amount of time backtracking and exploring you will get extremely overpowered when it comes to the bosses and mobs (I kill them extremely fast now, with no effort). Magick archer in particular, even if there are other strong advanced classes, comes off as extremely powerful and unbalanced, but realistically the other classes get OP too in different ways. I think the game could of used a soft-level cap at around 50 to keep things semi-difficult with some extra levels thrown in when you kill drakes/dragons to boost the power level up, which also admittedly resonates with the core game design in general. Exploration is amazing, you will lose hours to just wandering around, and that core gameplay loop of going out and exploring, fighting bosses and getting loot/doing quests is fun. Realistically this game needed about 6-12 more unique bosses and some power balancing. I'm hoping the post-game is super hard and unique, and that it pushes the boundaries of what's currently here. IMO this game needs a hefty DLC with a lot more content, but what's here is dope as heck and needs to be expanded upon, especially after the 12 year gap with LOTS of feedback from the original.FINAL Update Unless DLC - I have beaten the game, the true ending, gotten a lot of the achievements, and feel as if I have officially beaten the game. Now that all that's left for me to do is to explore anything I missed in New Game + and go back and redo some of the quests I failed. I also would like to get to True Post-Game again as I feel it is probably one of the best parts of the entire game. This part will contain some spoilers for the post game, so don't read this paragraph if you don't want some spoilers. The post-game is really cool! You essentially break the chain and put yourself into a berserk-esque bloodmoon world where there are a couple more unique bosses to fight, the water drains from everywhere, and you're now on a timer fighting for your life to figure out what to do. The timer mechanic isn't too bad, but you should 100% be using ferrystones to get around quickly and do the main quests as fast as possible. If you don't you can miss the opportunity to get the true ending and get pushed into NG+ as the red fog absorbed the world slowly over time. You also get pushed to NG+ if you rest too much or die apparently. I recommend carrying 3-5 Wakestones on you and some All-heal potions so you don't have to rest. You now have to go to every main settlement in the game and do a chain of quests to gather everyone for the final event. Every area is like day/night at the same time so you can run into large groups of any enemy, and bosses are way more frequent, which creates some super fun high-stakes action. Red pillars appear everywhere, and you should focus on these 4 pillars first. Once you do all these (bosses), you will then spawn a final pillar and THEN you have pretty much as much time as you need to explore, which you'll want to do. Now's the time to go around and look for Drakes, Lesser Dragons, and all the other bosses to try and farm up end-game mats for upgrades and dragon-forging. I eventually just kind of ended the game though and wanted to start in NG+.",1
Positive,A ladder took me to new heights.,1
Positive,She Dragon's on my Dogma until I 2,1
Positive,Its pretty much DD1 just with good graphics if you didnt like first one you not gonna like this. I loved first one and having a blast playing this one. Some bad performances in big cities and useless dlc that no one should buy or care about tanks reviews of very solid game. +1 for cooking cutscenes,1
Positive,"Quick version for those with a short attention span: The game is wildly fun, they're already hotfixing some of the optimization issues, and the microtransactions don't suck if you just don't buy them. Wait for a sale if you must, but please give the game a chance! I'm 60% of the way through the game and it's incredible.Yes, microtransactions suck, but anyone with common sense saw them coming since Capcom has minor MTX in most of their titles (DD1:Dark Arisen had 'em, every Resident Evil has had 'em). Like with DD1, DD2's MTX'd items can be found in-game or purchased with in-game currency. You don't have to buy them, and it's not pay to win (it's a single player RPG, I mean c'mon). Am I happy to see MTX attached to a single player RPG? No, but I have more than two brain cells and know how to just. not waste my money.- Combat feels amazing. I played a thief for the majority of my play time so far and you feel like an insanely badass assassin even at lower levels. Once you get your dodge stance and the ability to absolutely wreck weak points, you feel like a god of death in every fight.- The voice acting is a mix of really good and really goofy - but in a good way! I mean, anyone who played DD1 remembers the classic lines you heard every five minutes. They ill like fire, Masterworks all, etc etc. Granted, those lines were iconic because you seldom heard much else since they didn't record that many lines, but the point remains. Solid quality.- Beautiful visuals! The world is immersive and frickin' HUGE, and there are many moments where you just wanna soak in the surroundings.- The Journey: Getting from point A to point B feels like its own Lord of the Rings movie, with trials, tribulations and random side quests popping up. Oh, trader is under attack by harpies? Jump in, help out, get XP and money! A gryphon is dive bombing you? Get those blades ready, boyo! Oh, it's about to run off? Hop on its back so you can ride it back to its nest and steal its stuff after you finish it off.- Random encounters, even in cities! I had an ogre suddenly bum rush me after I walked through the gates of one of the cities, and it felt amazing to fight alongside the guards to bring it down. Occasional goblin raids are also a fun little diversion!- Super in-depth character creator! Not much more to it - it's great, and I've seen some truly amazing creations. (Looking at you, guy who made a 1:1 Shaggy clone in DD2)- Variance in gear upgrades. Different regions augment your gear in different ways, adding a nice little bonus layer of world building and making each locale feel more unique. Some are balanced, some favor strength, and others favor magic!- Good news, everyone! Capcom! No matter how negative some people may view Capcom, they support their games 100% and ensure that issues get fixed along the way. Microtransactions won't be going anywhere, but hotfixes abound whenever there's an issue. Just be patient - your rig will be able to play the game at 120FPS once they hotfix issues and reconfigure some of the files to use less load. (Please note: Not all rigs are the same. Consult your doctor before use.)Please note: None of the following is a deal-breaker for me or most others who have enough free will to actually play the game rather than coalesce on Reddit just to dump on the game.- Where the heck am I climbing?! Depending on the mob, you will encounter moments where you're trying to climb to their weak spot and suddenly you're on their left arm and you get flung to east Africa. Oh, there's a weak spot on their stomach and they're on four legs? Good luck getting to it, the camera will fight you every step of the way.- Needs some more optimization love. My game runs at a consistent 60 FPS on my current settings, but it does tend to chug in cities since DLSS hasn't been fixed yet (though, at the time of this review, it was in the works)- Hydrogen Bomb vs Coughing baby. Sometimes, you feel like the latter. Being stunlocked and knocked around like a pinball by a pack of mobs can get frustrating at times, but, thankfully, 90% of combat is you feeling like a Marvel superhero.- Microtransactions, no purchase necessary. Yes, they exist. Unwelcome, but we should've all seen it coming. Just. don't pay for stuff you can easily find in game in bulk or buy with in-game currency that's absolutely free.- Price tag. Goes without saying, but you can't blame the devs for the cost. It's the new industry standard and we just have to live with it.- No 'new game' button to start over if you have to.- Still a single save file system. C'mon, Capcom, it's 2024. If WoW taught us anything, alts are super common. Not everyone wants to delete their entire save file just to start from scratch.- Occasional cutscene / dialogue desync.- Pawns still have to be re-recruited to sync their level. DD1 was so many years ago and they still haven't adapted this system to modern gaming standards with a sync button or something similar.- Dragonplague. Don't look it up if you don't want spoilers, but it can heckin' frick up your save file depending on the circumstances.Wait, you're still here? And here I was thinking I got donowalled. Anyways, game is really fun and I've enjoyed every minute of it. As mentioned above, none of the negatives are that bad, just some minor annoyances. Some of the negative reviews come from people with plenty of hours in the game, so their opinions are still valid and should be taken into consideration. Just ignore the redditors who follow each other like lemmings to dump on a game just because it's their idea of funny.",1
Positive,"It's a shame the game is getting review bombed from people hastily jumping to conclusions as to take advantage of Steams refund window. If you have played Dragons Dogma 1, this feels like a very faithful sequel. Almost every mechanic has been carried over. Fast travel, pawns, combat. All with a massive boost to the level of polish. The MTX everyone is complaining about is nothing but a shortcut, everything you can buy on the steam shop is freely available in game, without much effort. Only a handful of hours in and I have enough RC to edit my character or anything else. If this is the one thing holding you back from purchasing the game, disregard the criticisms and give it a try, its an amazing game so far. Dragons Dogma as a franchise is not an RPG that will hold your hand. There's a lot of things you will need to research, look at wikis, etc. The gameplay is deep and there is a ton of discover. You will walk into areas you are very much not ready for and get destroyed. Its a learning experience and an amazing world to explore, with a massive map the second time around. Performance wise, you will definitely need a beefy PC. Personally running a 4070ti and a Ryzen 9 7900 and the only place I'm dipping below 60 FPS is in the city. It's likely playable on mid range machines, but you will definitely need to lower settings. But in my opinion this is a good thing. We need games to push hardware so we can have advancement. Without games like Cyberpunk, Crysis, etc every game would look like a Nintendo title thats 2 generations behind.",1
Positive,"No option to HIDE HELMET? I bought the ugliest one on accident, because I thought i could hide it. I guess I'm going without armor up top! :PI've played over 5 hours so far, but it feels like 5 minutes. Fun exploration and the battle mechanics feel great too. Although some of the graphics have that ""feathery"" look I used to have with my 1050 TI, and haven't seen in a good while since I got the 4090. I'm excited to play more because I haven't even SEEN the story get started, but when I checked the reviews I was dismayed. I hadn't looked at the 'changing character' stuff yet, but now that I have. it's a shame to see that there are microtransactions in a single player game. I wish you could unlock content through skill, you know, an award for actually playing the game. Companies are so greedy, even ones with good IPs. I hope they don't do the new FABLE so dirty when it releases (they will).",1
Positive,"Gameplay and world are amazing but talking about not adding fast travel because traveling is fun just to sell you a fast travel item (of which you get 5 per cycle anyways) for a few bucks is a joke (so just ignore them), almost as big of a joke as the weird performance which is the biggest problem, I get some bad frames in cities which is ""fine"" but having crash after crash or 30fps on something that exceeds the recommended specs by far is just wrong.Edit 1: To make it clear the dlcs are totally useless since you get everything easily ingame but I still gonna complain about their existenceEdit 2: Performance seems to be pretty good now for most people since the patch",1
Positive,"Some FPS drops in city but don t really affect me, that s an area needs to be improved and think it will.Apart from that gameplay is addictive and game is immersive . Really hooked into playing every day. Love it !",1
Positive,can't romance my pawn i am heartbroken,1
Positive,"I've never written a review before, but I really love this game. The optimization is crap, of course, but it wasn t that bad on my PC. The plot is quite small, but the side quests are interesting. Thanks for a great game, Capcom. Now we are waiting for Resident Evil 9 and, of course, dlc to DD'2.",1
Positive,"*UpdateI have since made a clean install of windows and tried the free character editor first which worked no problem. So I went ahead and bought the game again and I am enjoying it since. Playing the game first time I had issues with saving. I got that fixed though by running both the game and steam as admin. I still dont know what might have caused my previous issues, a program or file making it crash, I really have no idea. I still dont think its good that people need to troubleshoot so much before being able to play the game they have purchased, however since I am able to play now with no issues and enjoying the game, I have changed to ""recommend the game"". Though still proceed with caution.*oldDont really care about the DLC, they are optional and everyone has to decide for themselves if they wanna buy them or not. However I can not recommend this game as I was unable to play. After the shaders were compiled I saw the Capcom Logo and the next screen. After that it kept on crashing without fail. I tried several ""fixes"" i found online to no avail. Unfortunately I had to refund for now. I will give it some more time and might look into it again in couple months.",1
Positive,"The ""DLC"" Everyone is complaining about, You can earn in game, such as the book to customize your character. you actually can get into character creation again to customize yourself or your pawn again. Once you are at the first big city following the main story (pretty early) , you head to the market place. There is like a huge rift stone inside an open building. Next to it is a pawn at a small table selling a book for 500 Rift points (which you can earn in game) and a lot of the other dlc comes with the pre order bonus and literally says *this item will be acquired later in game i'm enjoying this game so far it's funEdit: I've now dunked 60 hours into the game and can say I love it, theirs so much to do and see and the vocations are amazing I also love the fact that you can just see other peoples pawns roaming around the map so you have a chance to see a goofy encounter. There's also hair dyes in the game that let you further customize your character you can get them whenever but the journey is a bit of a drag but still fun because you get to explore the map. Transportation in this game is especially easier to do late game the oxcarts seem to be placed around enough where there easy to access and I have a good abundance of ferrystones and i'm yet to buy any",1
Positive,"+Real game started ""when you defied your destiny at end""-Performance taxing especially at Vernworth capital-Mission/Quests structured as pre 2010 RPGs (Probability for loath this game by playing blindly is High)-few broken Vocation skills literally make this game easy-forced walk-travel early game, but travel make it easier on ""True End Game""8/10",1
Positive,The hypocrisy in Steam reviews: Resident Evil Village - Trauma Pack day1 release (overwhelmingly positive) Street Fighter 6 - Year 1 Character Pass on day 1 release (overwhelmingly positive) Resident Evil 4 - with day 1 dlcs (such as treasure maps) also gets an overwhelmingly positive review Dragon's dogma 2 - with day 1 dlcs (which you can acquire all in-game without any problem) suddenly gets a Mixed review bottom line is don't let clowns stop you from buying this amazing game.,1
Positive,"It's been so long since i have enjoyed any game around. Last time was when i finished Witcher 3 and it was soooo long time ago. Usually i play MMO games but as many you guys know, MMO's are just copy pasta these days and if they are not made by big company, the projects are laking and unfinished without any updates. Well, in these times were gaming was not fun to me anymore. Dragon's Dogma 2 just hop in to my radar and i have so much FUN man, holly molly! To be honest, i was waiting a online option where i can play with my friends or other people but as far as i see the way they integrated the pawn system, i feel like i have been playing with the real players. If you are new player and one of your friend just wipe everything in game with his/her pawn, you will just get that pawn for free (If you both are friends on Steam, it's 0 RC except level difference between you and pawn is 10+ it reqs 15-20K RC which cost a lot of $) and the pawn will just guide you through hole game man! Who would have thought of this system before? Not me for sure, since i'm stuck with bunch of copy pasta MMO's around. Tho i'm not playing any of them right now but still. And to be mention some of the clowns talking about microtransaction. Man. You can just farm RC in game without paying anything and you can buy literally mostly stuff. They are not that much expensive and special ones is in special NPC's where you buy with gold. I understand it's a greedy move but when we talk about other companys doing it, it's okey but when we talk about CAPCOM, it's not? Just enjoy the game, stop whining about it. It's not force you to buy those stuff, there is literally RC farming in game. CAPCOM also announce roadmap as well as updates & fixes for the game. Anyways back to topic. The gameplay, mechanics, atmosphere, mythical creatures, big bosses, dragons and such all the other stuff, man i'm in love with this game. I'll accept that the game has some FPS issues specially in towns and in city. But i noticed it was RTX ON option for me, looks like RTX was not working super great so at that moment i turned it off. Even i have the first Dragon's Dogma game which i never wanted to play, i felt like i didn't miss anything in 2nd game. About gameplay how it works and some different storys as much about dragon blood etc. Devs said, it will be huge game and i can literally say don't be mistaken by seeing every corner with sea, the game has insane buildings with insanely huge underground. I went somewhere called lab and man, i just lost the way. xD And there is much huge places outside and inside some of the caves, roads that connects special tunnels, bridges, when you got in, it's huge labyrinth! I do remember one place where i just lurk in my thief shadowcloak and try to collect all the things around without dying where i just going deeper and deeper in that cave. I felt like i been going in to magma core of the World. It was just endless for me and it took around 2-3 hours to search all the places. When i hit the outside i was like, woah man, wth, that was insane adventure. The way they made this world, you will feel like all the time Wow, woah, whaaat daa, no wayyyyy, yoooooo, etc etc. Definitely give this game a shot if you like pawn system and if you are huge fan of the huge open worlds. For me, this game already fitted in my heart, i felt this same thing when i was playing Witcher 3 last time and never had that so much fun and love again with another game. I have special thanks to CAPCOM and i will definitely waiting the 3rd game where we can able to play with my friends or online people in bigger worlds. Thank you for reading all the way down here, have a wonderful day! Edit: If any of you guys want my pawn as a guidance, she is level 52 and getting better and better everyday. You can recruit her even you are level 1 once you reach first Riftstone. She can able to swap between Sorcerer DPS and Mage Healer, support. You can add me on Steam to recruit her for free or check from my pawnID: 0U1CIJWIZI7Z (CAPCOM system usally takes time to update pawn details)",1
Positive,"First things first, i played the original DD1, the one with that badass opening music and have fallen in love with the game since and wanting to play the sequel. Now after playing DD2 i can safely say that the game is indeed good. But that's it, the magic that i felt when playing the first game is there for about 40-50 hours, but after that i just felt something is missing. For starter the combat feels good but that should be expected, you can feel the momentum of each hit, parrying attack feels rewarding, climbing monsters and attacking them in the face felt so good instead of attacking their toes or ankles like other games, the magick are amazing just like the original. But we only get 4 skill slots? why?. The original DD1 has 8 skill slots excluding Warrior which is a shame, if you're telling me 4 skill slots is due to technology limitation, someone made a mod so we can get 8 skill slots so that's not the reason, i certainly don't think that they decide to limit the skill slots for balance because this is SINGLE PLAYER PVE game. You lose your max hp the more you take damage but you can regain that either by camping in the wild or resting at an inn or your house in the city so you have to keep that in mind when you go into battle.As for the enemies, the variety is less than i expected, the mobs and the mini boss in the open world spawns at the exact same locations and as far as i know the only one mini boss that can just attack you out of nowhere is the griffin but they could have make the chimera or the ogre ambush us when we're travelling at night. The mini boss can also spawn inside the city near the gates which is strange because how the hell something that big make it into the city past the gates consistently, maybe it's because of the NPC that can appear out of nowhere right in front of you so the mini boss also spawn like that.The story is serviceable i guess, although it's a wasted potential. Imagine if we're actually the sovran, develop the kingdom, actually making impact on the world around you due to your decision and when you face the dragon that you see only twice the entire game, the stakes are higher because developing the kingdom, making impact on the world, makes you as the player care for the world that you have built. But fuck that we just an errand boy for everyone. Some of the side quests have alternate ending which is pretty cool. I also like that they don't have quest marker so you can actually miss some of the cool side quest if you're not exploring the world around you.The pawn system is very good just like the first game, the main pawn is your custom made companion and they can get hired by other players as a support pawn, you can hire two other pawns and make a party of four, they gain combat knowledge either from watching you play or watching other players and their pawns play, if they have the knowledge they will do certain things to make fighting enemies easier like trying to push a cyclops if its starting to lose balance or throw a rock to make them lose balance, using elemental weakness and telling you what their weakness is. Same as quests too, if you have a pawn that has done that quest with other players, they can show you how to finish that quest, essentially they keep learning as you progress in the game. Granted that they're not perfect and will do stupid things like falling of the cliffs or face tank a meteor but they also have moments that will awe youThe Inventory system is an improvement to the old one with the same weight limit system but in some areas i feel that they're taking a step forward and then a step backward. For example, when you deposit items to your storage chest, you can just select to mark the item to transfer it all to your storage or if you just want to transfer a certain amount to the storage chest and you're done, but when you use your own inventory system to transfer some items to your pawns you have to select the item, choose which pawn to transfer to, choose how many you want to transfer, and then you're done but if there's multiple types of items you want to transfer you have to repeat all of the steps for each type of items. Also you can only stack 99 of each items excluding equipment which is strange given that you can quickly reach that maximum number.Performance wise, i have a very good PC so i can run it pretty smoothly with some performance dip in the city. a lot of people said that's due to the RE engine. If that's the case then i don't think the performance issue will get fixed in the near future for PCSo, is Dragon's dogma 2 bad? absolutely not. It's a good game but it could have been so much more. It lacks the charm that the original has that makes it endearing to the players, they take several steps forward in some areas but also several steps backwards from the first game. There's no ""meh"" button so i'll just give it a thumbs up cause i want this game to succeed.TLDR: a solid game with good combat system, exploration and some branching quest",1
Positive,"I obviously haven't completed the game or anything at only 6+ hours, although I couldn't wait to review this as my experience so far has been absolutely phenomenal. First I'll address the issues that people have been complaining about (for the most part, rightfully so).The BIG problem I see people talking about is performance, and that is absolutely a problem. I personally haven't run into performance issues but I have a very good computer, I have seen from other people's experiences though that there is definitely issues, such as cutscenes being out of sync and massive frame drops when in populated areas or magic is used. However, I genuinely believe CAPCOM will optimise all of this in a patch, I would recommend waiting until this patch is released though just to be safe.The next thing people are complaining about are micro-transactions, which I just wanna point out I didn't even know about until other people pointed it out. The game does not throw micro-transactions in your face and literally everything you can purchase, you can get in game with relative ease (like you barely have to grind for it, if it could even be considered grinding). I'd like to point out as well that I am an avid hater of micro-transactions in games, I think it can literally more often than not, entirely ruin games for me, however this isn't the case for Dragons Dogma II.Okay now for the good stuff! The beginning part of the story is honestly not super engaging or anything, but it doesn't need to be. Basically you're on a quest to kill a Dragon, what more do you need in an Action RPG! Hahaha, joking aside the side content is where this game shines the most. I have never felt so free in a game to do basically anything I want. You want to pick up one of your Pawns and throw them at a nest of Saurians as an attack? Toss them. You want to kill an NPC essential to a quest-line? Murder them. You want to run into an area you DEFINITELY shouldn't be in and is probably for End-Game? Who cares, you're playing do what you want! Those are just a couple of examples of the large amount of freedom you have. On top of that, the map is MASSIVE. Like insanely big, but in the best way. Every corner of the map is worth exploring as they have hidden some of the best parts of the game in places you may not even think to look and it is just so amazing stumbling onto these awesome moments. The combat is also fantastic. I personally play as a mage so I somewhat miss out on the climbing on monsters mechanics, but I have tested it for myself and can confirm it adds a surprising amount of strategy to the combat, like more than you would expect. It's also so much fun climbing on top of a towering enemy and just stabbing them as you go up, feeling so small against their might and yet still proving a very serious threat to them. I really can't praise the combat enough.The last thing I will mention is the character customisation. I don't really think there are words to express how phenomenal the customisation is, like just WOW! It is so detailed and you can make the most attractive looking character or the most hideous monstrosity gaming has ever seen. You can make them tiny or make them a behemoth towering over everyone else. Honestly the only game I have come across which a Character Customisation system better than this is Black Desert Online (and even then, detail speaking it is pretty close).So basically:Positives:- Combat is SUPER fluid and enjoyable- The world is massive, beautiful and a genuine thrill to explore and discover- Character customisation is some of the best I have ever seen in any game- Freedom to do essentially anything you want, this isn't an exaggeration eitherNegatives:- There are big optimisation issues, but they should be fixed- There are micro-transactions, but you could play through the game unaware of their existence and earn everything in game anyway. This is barely a negative, just something to think about I guess.",1

Positive,"I bought Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen on a whim in 2017 or so and fell in love, spending almost 200 hours in it when all was said and done. When I heard Dragon's Dogma 2 was coming out, I was therefore immediately excited and counted down the days until its release, wanting to be on the ground floor this time. In this review I mostly want to explore whether or not it was worth the wait.Since the launch of this game was marred by two major controversies, I will start by addressing both of these in turn. Firstly the microtransactions, which were pounced upon by content creators and contributed to the game's mediocre Steam review score in a major way. I have no particular desire to defend these, since I agree with the criticism that these have no place in a single-player game, or ideally any game. I will say, however, that the reaction was disproportionate considering what is actually available in the form of these microtransactions. Pretty much everything on offer can easily be earned in-game. As someone who has been playing this game obsessively, and is theoretically the target audience, I never had the slightest desire to buy anything. In fact, in Dragon's Dogma the friction arguably is the game, to paraphrase an article I read earlier this week, and buying DLC to alleviate this is the equivalent of paying directly for a victory screen in other games. This does raise the question of why Capcom bothers to put this in their games in the first place, and hopefully the negative reaction has indeed given them some pause in this regard. I can't imagine the presumably paltry DLC income makes up for the lost sales due to negative press.Second is the optimization. I have an RTX 3070/i5-12600k rig - decent, but nothing spectacular. On the default settings, the game generally ran at 50-70 FPS in the outdoors areas, and significantly higher now that I've tweaked certain things. It is only in the main city of Vernworth that my FPS drop down to the 40-60 range, and occasionally even below that. This is on the edge of what I would consider to be acceptable, but you do get used to it after a while, and you generally won't be engaging in combat in this area anyway. In summary, I consider both of these controversies to be exaggerated, though not entirely baseless either. With that out of the way - is Dragon's Dogma 2 actually worth playing on its own merits? The game is similar to its predecessor almost to a fault, and anyone who loved Dark Arisen will find plenty to enjoy here as well. It is generally fun to fight enemies in DD2, particularly when you get to climb a monster and stab it in its vital parts for massive damage. The character creator is incredibly detailed, and if you're anything like me you will get attached to your pawn and smile from ear to ear whenever they come back from being hired by another player. You are encouraged to thoroughly explore areas and track down materials and collectibles to improve your equipment and base stats. The game is often aesthetically impressive, especially after the latest update, and the two kingdoms you'll spend most of your time exploring look and feel very distinct from each other.Unfortunately, its similarity to the first Dragon's Dogma is its weakness as well as its strength. It has not done as much as it could have to improve on the formula, and quite a bit of potential has been wasted. A lot of the dialogue still feels stilted and awkward, and not (just) because it's presented in old-timey English. It is still unnecessarily cumbersome to navigate menus using keyboard and mouse. Quests and mechanics can be buggy, and at one point I even lost out on an important reward (a specialization tome) because of this. It is also clear that the developers ran out of time towards the end of the dev cycle, with the main quest coming to a rather abrupt conclusion, compared to the slower build-up in the first part of the game. Would I ultimately recommend this game? If you are a longtime Dragon's Dogma fan, the answer is an unqualified yes. It is essentially more of the same, only with a much bigger world and presented in a more visually appealing way. If you are new to the series, the answer to this question is more nuanced. It is important that, independent of either hype or controversy, you realize exactly what sort of game this is. DD2 deliberately makes it difficult and cumbersome to do certain things, and you will be frustrated at times, not so they can sell you the solution in the form of DLC as certain people would have you believe, but (as I said earlier) because to a large extent, the friction is the game. The power fantasy lies in gradually and efficiently overcoming these obstacles, almost just as much as it does in defeating monsters. If you feel that this is a mindset you could eventually get into, then DD2 is one of the most unique games to have come out in recent memory, and is absolutely worth a try. It seems likely that it will only improve with time, as patches continue to come out, and with the first expansion already rumored to be on the way.",1
Positive,"This is a total re-write of my original review (mostly I was asking questions in my original review and I have since learned the answers to those questions)I am very much obsessed with this game, I have literally not played anything else. I have restarted a new game once, I have logged MANY hours but I am hardcore trying to avoid completing the story. I've not played the original Dragon's Dogma so I'm brand new to the story and the whole pawn system thing. As a complete DD virgin, I have to say I'm so impressed with the open world exploration, the fabulously exciting combat, and I dearly love using pawns. 10/10 no notes.People complain about microtransactions / pawns being annoying / FPS issues, but I'm saying: I don't agree. The microtransactions are completely irrelevant, you get these items in game by exploring or using in-game currency. It's not a valid reason to hate on the game for me. Also I personally love the pawn system. I love the pawns so much, I don't think it's annoying that they repeat phrases or whatever, I like them. I'm a bit paranoid about dragonsplague bc it hindered my ability to do some side quests in my first playthrough, but it's been nerfed recently (at the time of writing this).I have to say that it was difficult the first time I entered Vernworth as my FPS dropped well below 30. I am now using Lossless Scaling and I run everything on the lowest setting (graphics-wise) and my FPS has definitely improved. If you have a low end pc, I'd recommend getting Lossless Scaling and also please don't give up on the game just because of the known FPS issues. I worked around it and I feel like the gameplay is 100% worth the extra effort.",1

Positive,"This game is how I imagine a nursing hand job would be.You are a chosen one but the world is still happening to you.Explore and wander, find stuff then see a giant enemy, you and three other guys(making the perfect party number: four) beat the doors off it.",1
Positive,"This game is amazing, yes it has stupid micro transactions that make no sense and don't effect the actual game. making them pointless. Also who the hell puts micro transactions in a single player albeit mostly offline experience. makes Capcom look stupid. still loving the game tho. 8/10 fer me.",1
Positive,"It is true this game is poorly optimized but that is all. All these twitch ""stars"" and ""influecers"", shitting on this game, saying they never experienced stuff like this, probably forgot about Ubisoft studio. FPS drops might be a nope for some but it is not big deal, honestly. Since combat is pretty easy and you dont need to watch for i-frames This game is awesome. Big open and lively world. So many things to explore. You will often find yourself distracted by other things happening in this world, while doing questsAbout microtransaction: they are not essential. You will come across those things by just playing the game. You dont like them? Dont buy them then.",1
Positive,"good fun RPG, exploration aspect is really good, it really makes you check every nook and corner to find hidden chests and its contents. The limited access to fast travel is good in my opinion as it really forces you to explore the area more and prepare yourself throughout the journey. I only just unlocked the second half of the map and it got so much harder I really needed to plan out the journey with the campfires. It's good to be able to play different vocations in the one playthrough so you can trial and error what works for you.Never played DD1 so can't compare but as a game itself it's been really good. 100hrs in.",1
Positive,"Ignore the hubbub about the microtransactions; while this kind of monetisation is reprehensible, they are clearly tacked on, and counter to what some claim, do not impact the game itself in any way.The game is a true sequel to the original in the sense that nothing fundamental has changed. If the original appealed to you, this probably will as well. The most improved aspect is that of exploration; uncovering the map bit by bit and discovering all its nook and crannies is a great experience.With the exception of big cities, the performance is fine on my PC.",1
Positive,"I don't approve of the micro transactions, but I will say who ever lets themselves to be nickled and dimed in a single player RPG.you deserved it. Nothing they offer you need, it's pay for convenience and cosmetics.The game itself is just awesome and everything I wanted from a DD2. It is pretty much DD1, but with improvements across the board that make it even more enjoyable. The world is huge and you can get side tracked from what you were doing constantly, which is welcome if you like it. If not you will have to get some discipline, I guess.Performance is also alright, unless you belong to the ""I have a 3060, I want to play games cranked up to the max with raytraycing, play at 4k resolution and get 120fps"" Then yes, the performance is god awful. Just like any game that has released the last few years I guess. I have a laptop here with a 3070 and a i7 11800H, outside of the main city I have 60fps at medium-high settings at 1080p. Perfectly acceptable performance imo. In the city I get drops to 30-40. Which means 99% of the time I have acceptable performance.The reviews are a clear case of undisciplined people blowing things out of proportion.",1
Positive,"After rolling credits once more on NG+ I can finally put some thoughts to text and give my testimony.Dragon's Dogma 2 is good, performance hiccups and manufactured controversy be damned. The most I wanted out of this was simply the first game with some refinement and it delivered that in spades. What issues I do have (a lack of an endgame aside from the Unmoored World and no hard mode to keep up with me and my Pawn) could easily be rectified in either an expansion or update. The sense of adventure is palpable and the additions made to how Pawns interact with you and others of their ilk made them more endearing than ever.If you're uninitiated, snag Dark Arisen on sale before playing this. Trust me, they're both worth it.",1
Positive,"I mean fuck the micro-transactions but oh do I fucking love this game, it just feels like an improved version of the first game which let me tell you is one of my favorite games of all time. I don't really have the best pc specs for this game but it's still running around 20-30 fps (which is still very much playable) with my old ass pc from 2015, I legit only have like 8 gig ram in total and some shitty DDR3 motherboard. I pray to the omnissiah everyday that the game will start, nay, I pray everyday that my computer will start. But I highly recommend this game for anyone even slightly interested in fantasy/action games.",1

Positive,"After having nearly 70 Hours in and not even doing story quests yet, here are my review of the gameplay itself. I will update story content later on this review.I will compare Dragons Dogma 2 to its Predecessor: Dragons Dogma Dark Arisen. + Combat feels way more impactful for any vocations, every vocations feels very strong in their own right. We also get execution like attacks that are available once enemy is downed to deal major damage+ Animations are dynamic! If you are hitting a flying enemy your character will actually swing their weapon higher to hit them and hit the floor if its beneath them+ The Pawn's chatter is greatly improved by having them react to each other's comments and banter between one another is exactly what any Dragons Dogma fans wants. Straightforward is my favourite Pawn Inclination due to how candid and hilarious they are.+ The world is 4 times the size of the Original Game. The world is a ton of fun to explore. I had a blast of ""Hold up a minute, whats that?"" Getting sidetracked from where I want to actually go every 5 minutes+ Diverse giant monsters are also a ton of fun to fight just like the previous game. They buffed Chimeras and Armored Cyclops to feel more threatening.+ Imminent Triumph / End of Struggle returning into the soundtrack for DD2 is such a good throwback as well.+ So much stuff to do! I cant stress you how engaging sidequests are in this game, every sidequests feels unique and impactful just like the first game. I remember helping 2 brothers in a village and then later on they helped me back for another quest.+ NPC romance/friendship/affinity system is completely overhauled, they wont serve for one purpose only in the old game aside from giving a discount to you if they're a merchant, in DD2 NPCs you interact with will reward or send you gifts to your PLAYER HOME(new feature). I get a lot of rare items, equipment rings, curatives and many more depending on the character you befriend. Sometimes even Pawn Specializations.+ So many ways to tackle quests / exploration and also combat. And the best part is pawns will actually comment on your solution on said problems and praise you for being creative.+ The UI overhaul also looks very special and aesthetically unique. The Sundial from the menu is literally a sundial, showing in-game time directly and change based on in-game time.+ Loss gauge and Camping is added and its a welcoming change! Making travelling much more adventurous and thrilling. However you can only cook at camp and not much during camp aside from changing skills which is also very cool. I wish they added more stuff like camp decorations and Pawn interactions etc.+ Adding or Finding Pawns have made easier with the addition to Pawn IDs! No more needing a third party host site to host and manually update your pawn every day - The soundtrack is very generic and immemorable. I miss the guitars from the first game since it was such a unique touch and flair into this IP, I hope CAPCOM capitalizes on that. Please I bid you, bring back Tadayoshi Makino and Rei Kondoh please.- Inventory Management is a huge downgrade. Everything is manual now for some reason. Dragons Dogma Dark Arisen is way easier to manage your inventory. You can store items based on category with a single button press but you cant here for some reason. You also cant change equipment from storages unlike the first game, to me this is a huge downgrade and a fucking chore. Now I need to withdraw armor manually equip it on a seperate menu, then deposit the old armor in the storage menu. Its tedious and stupid.- The Pawn System is downgraded, this is particularly on their combat and bestiary knowledge. they dumbed down the bestiary knowledge and only limited them to major bosses. You no longer need to farm bestiary knowledge for minor monsters like wolves, saurians and the like resulting in rare occasion in which your pawns calls out the monster's names, making players having a hard time knowing the name of the monster they are dealing with. To me its a downgrade because for me its very fun to see your pawn progressively learn to deal with problems they are not familiar with and overcomes the problem after witnessing how YOU deal with it directly from their eyes.- There are some details lost from the first game like water driplets when you're drenched, monsters shattering once broken from freezing, managing flasks of liquid and interacting them. These details were already in the first game and adds so much charm to the original game.- Performance Issue. My rig is AMD Ryzen 5 5600x, RTX 2070 Super Ti, 16 GB RAM. At first my CPU kept overheating, causing my motherboard to lost connection to my GPU. However, once I cleaned up my PC(removing dusts and clean fans) I do not experience the same issue anymore. My performance is 60 FPS outside world but 20 FPS in the Vermund Town only unfortunately. The rest of major and minor towns are fine. ?/10 cuz I havent finished the game yet. I will update it later!I have defeated the game twice with 200 hours in, and I can safely say the game is a solid 8/10. But if we count on how many developers worked on this game, its a 10/10. Only 392 people are involved in the game",1
Positive,"Dragon's Dogma 2 feels exactly like a game from 2010 - in all the good ways, and unfortunately, the bad. As a fan of the original, I quickly found myself at home with familiar footing. It was all there: the tropey fantasy story, the unrivaled pawn system, the truly gargantuan (and so-dang-satisfying) spells, and the fun.the fun of just playing! Dragon's Dogma 2, at it's core, is just simply plain fun.And I wish I could end the review there. What I said is true, the core is there, and it's fantastic. Yet unfortunately it's wrapped in a few layers of ""difficulty"". To best address this, I've broken up the remainder of my review into two parts: performance and quality-of-life.PerformanceThis game is all over the place. With a 13900k and 4090 (at 1440p), the biggest issue I had was variability. In the wilds, frame-rate was in the 100-120 range and fairly consistent. In the cities, frame-rate was in the 60-70 range and fairly consistent. The problem is transitioning from one to the other. Fast travel, or changes in the environment with regards to NPC population, make the gap between these ranges quite obvious. And the weaker your system, the clearer (and less enjoyable) this will become. By all means, the game is still playable, but there is clearly work to do and you should be wary depending on the power of your PC. Look at (recent) videos on YouTube for comparable systems to get an idea of how it'll run.Quality-of-lifeQuests can be esoteric and, at times, unforgiving. Thankfully, for the most part, you'll rarely run into a situation where you're lost or feel like the game has cheated you - because of a bug or miscommunication. Unfortunately, the cases where that does happen are strikingly clear because of the unacceptable save system. Mind you, I don't have an issue with the camp/auto-save versus inn save, but I have plenty of issues with not letting the player control their save in a game where making one small mistake can have unintended consequences or prevent them from accessing content. Some players will like that, but for the vast majority it will simply be a hindrance to their enjoyment.ConclusionGames like this are always tough to review and, at the end, are a mixed bag. In truth, if you have a powerful-enough PC and are careful to back up your saves and occasionally check the wiki or a YouTube guide for a confusing quest: you will be fine. Not only that, the epic, sprawling, fantastical world of Dragon's Dogma 2 will open up to you and (nearly) every moment will be a ton of fun. It's just a shame that the onus for that is on the player.If you're wary, give it a shot on a sale, because if you can work around the rough spots.this game is a great.",1
Positive,"As Capcom have promised they're gonna address the flaws, I'll give the game a thumbs up for now. Aside from the major issues which will hopefully be addressed, the actual game is just an all-round improvement on the original, except that climbing a creature is a nightmare due to the overwhelming amount of visual effects practically blinding you.I had high hopes, but even within the tutorial area I'm suffering from terrible lag, stuttering, and missing textures (I have a PC comparable to recommended specs). Feels like the game should be in early alpha rather than a full release. Add that to day 1 DLC (yes, it's not required, but it sets a bad tone and encourages poor game balance to encourage players to buy more stuff) and I'm not best pleased. The game itself is actually very good, but these issues stop me from recommending it as the poor business practices and game quality prevent you from appreciating it properly. So until it's in a properly enjoyable state, don't buy.ETA: I've played further in, and the game stops lagging as bad in the wilderness, and after finding some community fixes for the missing textures I've not had any further issues. The game outside of the major flaws I mentioned is a good game, but I can't recommend it until the developers do the bare minimum of improving optimisation in busy areas and fixing the texture bugs so the game doesn't suffer from invisible floors, then I can't recommend it. It's sloppy and lazy and if you somehow miss the fact that entire floors are missing during testing, your testing is abysmal.Further ETA: The devs have responded to the various issues raised with mixed results. Apparently they haven't addressed the major issue with the DLC options (as per above) and just reiterated that it is available in-game. They're ""looking into optimising the CPU load"" (whilst this is an issue, the major issue is that if your recommended specs are unable to maintain a constant frame rate, why did you make them your recommended specs? It's false claims and from an outside perspective it looks a lot like lying to get people to preorder the game who can't actually run it properly), and are ""looking into"" making it possible to start a new game (at present you're forced into NG+. The ability to start a new game was possible in the original with no problems.) If poor frame rate and stuttering is fixed and the texture issues are resolved, then I'd recommend the game.",1
Positive,"What I liked:- It's DDDA but better. Simpler and more refined, Unapologetically as clanky and janky as the previous game. Almost everything you liked about DDDA is in, they only left a few things out from the first game. They even made it look and feel like the first game. Basically if you liked or loved the first game, you'll feel the same for this game. So I'd advise anyone on the fence on this game - go play the first game (twice, because. you know).What I didn't like:A little buggy. Massive CPU load in towns. Still as clanky and janky as the previous game, just like in the first game, where you might need just a single keypress in other games, you'll need to facepalm your keyboard in this one. They DID leave out a few things from the first game, i.e. certain overpowered skills and abilities - hmm, I kinda like this.PSA: All those consumables DLC (read: uTX)? You can earn 100s of Rift Crystals within the first hour. 10 hours and you're swimming in 10k RC. Obviously Capcom thinks video game players are really stupid. Judging by the player reviews. Capcom is right.-Some minor spoilers ahead-You can farm Rift Crystals (RC) at the rate of a few hundred per half-hour session from higher tier spirit/ghost mobs. You can then camp/inn-rest to respawn them/etc.When a mob gets killed, you get both an eXPerience reward (character level) and DisCipline Points (vocation level and vocation skill purchase/upgrades). The ratio of the eXP/Dcp is higher for higher tier mobs - i.e. for quicker levelling of vocations, kill lots of low level mobs. You CAN max rank all vocations before you hit level 42 (takes a stupid amount of effort and is somewhat less fun)If you are new to the franchise or play a lot of games similar to WoW. don't skip the dialogue, PAY ATTENTION and be very, very aware that a quest can be solved in more than a few ways, i.e. the game doesn't do much paw-holding and expects you to think out of the box. This is NOT a Ubisoft or EA game (except the uTX DLCs. Capcom literally thinks you are dumb enough to buy sand while on the beach - Capcom is right)",1

Positive,"More fun than Elden Ring tbh. This game has classes where your attacks and skills actually feel unique. The physics based combat mixed with beautifully crafted world exploration will make you lose track of all time. Some cool moments that happened to me:- Was fighting a herd of goblins, had 1 jump at me from range while I was just happening to be running at it as well, I jumped and drop kicked it in the air pushing it back and I back flipped off that kick and shot him with my bow- Was fighting a Cyclops and double jumped onto his face stabbed it with my knives and held on and stabbed it a couple more times. Used the big damage skill that stabs him for big damage and jumps back. Mid jump back I used the double jump again and latched onto his face again with the knives and he toppled over.The game is fun to play and feels very cinematic as well. The pawn system is super fun - you get to gear up your main pawn and have other people use it and reward you for using it.",1
Positive,"This game is PERFECT. 10/10. Don't let negative reviews fool you. The gameplay and story is amazing. i have played for nearly 10 hours with no issues at all, no bugs or glitches.

It is everything Dragon's Dogma 1 was but even better.MICROTRANSACTIONS - A lot of people are complaining about this and on a surface level it seems bad, but everything that you could buy is easily obtained in game.so I don't really understand why Capcom decided to give you to the option to buy things. Things like Rift Crystals and Character appearance edits are doable in-=game and the same items are obtainable in-game. If this game is anything like the last one then you could literally just buy these items from an npc later on in the game.",1
Positive,"Game is really good.You can get everything in the game easily without paying for nothing. If you played DD1 for more than 10 hours you would know that. Performance and Denuvo complaints are valid, the rest is either fake news, people crying or zoomers that never played the first game.",1
Positive,"Updated Review: After 50 hours and 1.5 playthroughs of the game, I can say this much; much like the first game, it's a flawed gem, but a gem all the same. If the idea of DD's combat sandbox is something you watch in videos/streams and think ""That looks sick"", then you'll probably really dig the game. For all of the game's flaws, that sandbox is what gives you those moments of ""Wow that was crazy"" and drags you further in. I've not finished a game and then immediately started again, completely from scratch for a VERY long time, but I did it the next day after finishing DD2 for the first time. Not even NG+ either, just yeeted my saves and started again.Further content updates and polishing to performance would be great, as it would smooth out the rough edges and small gaps in enemy variety, vocations, etc that currently exist. But did I enjoy the game? Yeah, absolutely, so it goes to a positive because of that.ORIGINAL REVIEW: Game ran absolutely fine at medium-high settings on 3440x1440, DLSS set to Quality, nowhere close to my VRAM cap. Then I got to the first town and just looking in a particular direction dropped my frames from around 90-100 straight down to the 20-30's. I said this sequel would be marred by technical performance issues and here we are, like clockwork.I can't recommend this and ""Itsuno's Vision"" needs a swift kick in the arse for failing to prioritize function over form and fancy, and that's coming from someone who adored the previous game.",1

Positive,"~TL;DR,Solid 7/10 game. Definitely needs work and probably could've done well with being pushed back a couple months to better work on the performance. And I think it would be smart for them to remove all of the mtx and hope to recover some user score.Waiting on a discount isn't a bad idea, but if you loved the 1st game then you'll enjoy this one too.~The gist of it:- The Good:- Stunning visuals with beautiful art and scenery.- Dynamic and enjoyable combat.- Above-average quality voice acting.- Beautiful sounds and music.- The bad:- Performance issues on less-than-modern CPUs or in instances where people over-stress their computer.- (Friendly) NPCs use a lot of CPU, causing most people to experience performance issues in towns.- Micro-transactions (though they're easy to avoid, not advertised in-game, and all the items can be earned through gameplay).- The eh:- Movement in the first game was slow and heavier, and felt more realistic. Movement in this game feels a lot lighter and more akin to your typical modern third-person POV game movement.- Certain settings are worded in a different way compared to how they're normally worded, meaning some people have had trouble finding certain settings such as the FOV (its called camera distance).- While the voice-acting itself is pretty alright in my opinion, I've noticed that the player's sounds can sometimes be louder than they should be, as if they were made for a first-person POV.~The long of it,- The fact that 100% of the mtx content can be earned in-game through playtime, but that most people who complain about them or review bomb the game haven't played enough or researched enough to learn that's not the case, is goofy. I've seen a lot of people blast the game for having items locked behind mtx, but that's not the case. Mtx content isn't cool, but despite the greed, they don't take away quality from the game or your experience, mtx like this is really just idiot tax.- I've also seen complaints about uncapped fps or no FOV slider, but settings for both of these have existed since launch. (Idk about console settings).- Unfortunately when you're around A LOT of npcs, you do take some performance hit but I don't drop below 50fps (I cap at 60 and usually max around 120 at uncapped fps with an intel i5 and rtx4070, 32gb ram but the game strangely self-caps at 11.98gb). I've heard a lot of people say they'll even dip below 30fps, but have yet to experience it. Unfortunately NPCs will also render and unrender strangely around you, but thankfully that's only in towns and I haven't experience that with hostile npcs.- Visually the game is stunning, and I have no issues rendering the world or lag in areas of high object counts or large enemy hordes.- I have high hopes they fix their issues, and I hope that the constant witch-hunting of the game isn't going to kill motivation from the devs or make people lose hope for the game.",1

Positive,"This game is truly Dragon's Dogma 2.You'll hear people complain about the microtransactions. that's fine. You'll hear people complain about the game's performance. That's also fine. everybody has the right to complain.Know that the microtransactions are:1. Pointless. you do not need to make any of them, and almost all of the items behind MTX are available with in-game currencies.2. Not unprecedented. The first game had gear and rift crystals and such available for purchase, Monster Hunter Rise sold character edit vouchers. This is standard for Capcom at this point and can be ignored.Performance Issues:I have a strong computer, this game makes my computer cry. It still runs massively better than the original game ever did, on PS3 and Xbox 360. If anything having performance issues makes it even more ""Dragons Dogma"" to me.Everything I've encountered during gameplay has been a blast. I'm having so much fun.",1
Positive,"Works well as a sequel to Dragon's Dogma, but not Dark Arisen. It really needs a ball-busting expansion to round out the experience. That said, it's still fucking Dragon's Dogma.",1
Positive,Amazing graphic detail on camp cooking scenes ;],1
Positive,Nude mod was out before the game,1
Positive,"Even though the game has some performance issues especially in cities, and worthless micro transactions that you can get in game anyways. It still is a amazing game, I am already hooked tot the character creator and am enjoying the game more then the first. The pawn system is great even better then the original, I find it funny how the pawns I rent from friends tell me what they are doing in there game, like bringing multiple girls home but never the same one lol. It is also nice to see the pawn talk to each other, or one may go sit in the grass and smell flowers, while the other one runs off to gather me stuff. There AI seems to be pretty good so far, and I can't wait to try out new pawns, as long as they don't give me any STD's :) .Combat seems fun like the first one and since I don't have to level multiple vocations to be able to play my preferred vocation with perfect stats (mystic spear hand) that is just gravy. I enjoy the versatility it brings to the game and know I can just try another one out at any time.The story is 100 times better then the first so far, even if it ends up just being a average story in the end. It just seems more fleshed out at least at the start and I am more invested already then I was in the original. Plus Capcom saved me from having to throw a certain pawn into the brine again :) .There are also mods popping up already which means another play through in the future will be at hand.So in short I am enjoying this game a lot and can't wait to continue on, hopefully Capcom will patch the performance issues quickly and for the love of god give me a option for a new game.",1
Positive,"Dark Arisen is better and more polished, but this is still a fun game. It has more flaws than it's predecessor, while not really changing up the game in any way for the better, but it oftentimes will show even greater flashes of ambition - even if it stumbles trying to reach for the sky.",1

Positive,"Game is an absolute blast for fans of Dragon's Dogma 1. While there are currently some performance issues, it is completely playable and I am getting better framerates than console users are on average. Also do not feel compelled to buy any of the MTX Capcom is pushing, it is all purchasable in game for not even much gold.",1
Positive,"As someone who played Dragon's Dogma 1 way back when it released in 2012 on Xbox 360 this game is everything I wanted from it and more, it really feels like the game they had envisioned but we never got. The combat is fluid and feels great to fight enemies no matter how many times you do it and the story so far is actually THERE which is a huge step up from the first game. (Not Gransys) feels great to explore and I'm always curious about what's around the next corner it's a fantastic feeling to actually get engrossed in Dragon's Dogma again after all these years.The game does have issues though currently, the frame rate varies a lot from out in the field with 60FPS to in the main town down to (the lowest I've seen) 19 FPS it really is jarring. Capcom has said they're ""aware"" of the issue with performance but who knows when that'll get fixed.Are there Microtransactions? Yes and it sucks there here at all but they're literally nothing, DMC5 and RE4 have the same kind of microtransactions and anything you can pay for you can get in game just by playing it so honestly if anyone buys them they're just actively stupid.",1
Positive,"As somebody who played the original Dragon's Dogma AND Dark Arisen for over 5,000+ hours, I can confidently say that YOU DON'T NEED TO PURCHASE ANYTHING. Performance issues are a separate thing and I'm hopeful that Capcom will sort that out as soon as possible.- Rift Crystals (RC) are mostly used for hiring Pawns, and you can completely bypass that by asking for a Friend Request. - You don't need Portcrystals so early in the game, same goes for Wakestones.- Art of Metamorphosis will eventually be replaced by Secret of Metamorphosis, which is a permanent option in your main menu that you can also purchase with just in-game gold.I see what Capcom is trying to do, but don't let your desire for instant gratification get to you, you really won't miss out on anything if you don't purchase any of these items. Just like with the original game, they'll remove the MTX once they see people aren't buying any of them. This is a slow-burn game. Take your time and you WON'T NEED TO PURCHASE ANYTHING.",1
Positive,"So running on my 5 year old PC, seems to run fine. I'm only in the first area, but have tried quite a few things. Maybe I'll have problems later, so we'll see. Not sure what these performance issues are, that people are having?As I said I've only just started but it's what I expected from Dragon's Dogma 2 so far.Already created a custom pawn to help and making of other player's too, which was something I really enjoyed form the previous game.Just don't make silly pawns that you will regret later, as you are stuck with them, unless you pay a RL premium I believe.Fought some harpies without ranged, which was frustrating but doable, and smashed loads of gobbos. Fun Times in Dragon's Dogma!",1
Positive,"Game doesnt run like a dream but it runs well enough for me.DLC is nonsense but every piece of DLC is available in-game, easily at that and you really dont need to buy it unless you're lazy.As a fan of the first game, this one is living up to it. Its as fun to throw enemies of cliffs now as it was 12 years ago",1
Positive,"Game is awesome and really fun. Love the world building, character creation, and combat mechanics. The only issue(s) I have is that the main quest-line could've been a lot longer and sometimes the fps stutters a bit (which could just be an issue with my rig.) All in all, I'd definitely recommend this game to anyone interested or looking to get into the genre.",1
Positive,"questionable performance at launch, but gameplay is true to the first game but better. Better combat, visuals, story. It gud, even with the microtransaction meme, as long as your pc can run it. gamers on pc are so fickle, sucks it's getting review bombed",1
Positive,"Even 'tho I thoroughly enjoyed the game, explored about 80% of the world, did the true ending (unmoored world) and all the extra content that comes with it, I think the game was way too short.35hrs for a full playthrough with the extra content from the ending is not nearly enough for a game of this size to justify the 70 bucks. That's why I do not recommend at this time. I do recommend this game if it's on sale because the game is truly amazing but sadly too short.EDIT: After playing through NG+ and finding things I havn't found on my 1st playthrough, exploring even more areas, doing even more stuff during the true ending and having spent another 58hrs, I retract my early statement and just want to say this game is truly amazing! I love it and might even start a fresh save soon.",1

It is DD1 but better in pretty much every way. It has me hook, line and sinker it is so bloody good.If you are a DD1 fan and not hyper-triggered by dumb capcom things, you have to get this.Dragon's Dogma 2 is finally here.",1
Positive,"While yes performance is all over the place, don't let the Screaming Reddit Manbaby crowd keep you away. The microtransactions, while unfortunate, are superfluous and easily ignored. A sad reality of getting (most) games made today but these are toothless and inconsequential. This is largely the first game, just on a grand scale. If you bounced off 1, you'll bounce off this. If you loved 1, you'll love this. If you've never played it, check out some guides and overviews for 1 as they'll give you a sense of if you'd like this. Plus Dark Arisen goes on sale often so you can think of that as a little taste of this.I personally am loving it. It's not for everyone, but it's definitely for some.",1
Positive,"currently 7.5/10. Easily an 8 or even 8.5 once they fix performance for the massesFirst, Let me get through the big Elephants in the room. Performance:I'm probably one of the very lucky ones to be honest, performance overall was very good, minus vernworth. The first city Vernworth i get a weird stutter every so often. Which isn't ideal but honestly i can live with it. Everywhere else is great, even the next couple big cities. for the people complaining. Guess they forget how bad the 3rd act of BG3 (GOTY 2023) ran on launch. And Novigrad, The Witcher 3 (GOTY 2015). Those ran terribly too, eventually fixed it. Micros transactions: Not once have I felt the need to purchase any of the things on the store. And not once, did capcom throw anything in my face in regards to the micro transactions. Everything is easily obtainable in the game.Should they be there? Probably not. Are they there? Yes, and there's a reason for that, people obviously buy into this and companies like capcom know they do. So unless you inception the idea to every person who does buy into the stupid micro transactions, then keep on complaining because i'm sure that will get you somewhere.Pretty sure that covers the big elephants. So i'm going to keep it brief. Do you like Dragons Dogma 1? Get it. Do you like action rpg fantasty games? Wait till they fix the performance. This game does not hold your hand, you got to listen to what npcs say, and act accordingly. Quests are very vague, and rely on a bit of sleuthing and thinking outside the box in some cases to get things done. The vocations are great and fun to use. And having pawns (npc party) there is great. Just get used to them pointing out every ladder (you can't see) and every treasure chest (you can't reach). Overall a fun fantasy rpg. If you are worried about performance, just wait for it to get fixed. Don't worry about the micro transactions they won't matter. A massive upgrade from the first Dragons DogmaI'd wait for a little bit of a sale though, these game prices have been sky rocketing lately.",1
Positive,"This game is everything that the first game is and a lot more, there are some small but pretty bad issues that does make it a game that is not worth full price in certain cases.First the issues with the game, here there are two main ones that are actually legit unlike a lot of the complaints in the comments. PERFORMANCE: the game runs like shit, there is no going around this, if you do not have a good PC you will not be able to play it unlike the first game. this is a game breaker for some people, aka Valid Complaint. STORY: it sucks giga hard, there is no excuse for the story in the game it is very short and it feels like you skipped 90% of the journey to the end. this however in my opinion is not that bad since I didn't buy this game for the story in the first place. can be a game breaker if you did not play the first game.Now after these two things the game is almost perfect, it has the best combat and exploring of any RPG I have ever played. most quests are really fun and the secrets even more so. getting better gear is fun af. IMO the eternal ferrystone from the first game is really missed. Buy this game if you liked the first ones combat, exploring, and general feel of gameplay. Do not buy this game if you did not like the first game or did not play the first game and are unsure of this(go play the first one before you play this)PS It is not ""Pay 2 Win"" like alot of people are saying, sure you technically can buy dlc for the game that give you the currency in game but that does not matter at all if you play the game for more then 5 minutes and If it wasnt drama I would not have know about that. There are zero predatory ads or things forcing you into buying with microtransactions.",1
Positive,"No doubt, one of the Best RPG game for me.The complexity of this game is what makes it better and Level of Fun will increase as you spend more and more hours to it.* Combat : 10/10 * Story : 7/10* Exploration : 9/10* Favorite Vocation : Thief\Mystic SpearhandCons: Only cons for me was its unfair Fast travel system, the resources are pretty limited and considering it a RPG it could have been way better. That being said, I would highly recommend this game if you love complex RPG games.",1
Positive,"While I fully agree that the game needs patches to fix the performance on most PCs, I own a 4090 with a 14th gen i9 and can thankfully play with everything set to maximum while having the FPS staying higher than the 70 mark.However, the reason for my review is not to praise the performance, which is not good, but to address all the people raging about ""pay to win items"" and ""having to pay to change the character's appearance"", even if I agree that single player games shouldn't have MTX period (preferably not even multiplayer games, but that's a pipedream in the current industry). All the content the DLCs offer can be bought IN-GAME with in-game currency, and rift crystals can be obtained by other players hiring your pawn (and dropped by enemies too), there is nothing beyond the music replacer (which changes some sounds and music to DD1's for nostalgia) that can't be obtained by simply playing with no effort whatsoever.You CAN erase your savefile to make a new character, disable the cloud save and then erase the save from your computer, it's a hassle that could have been addressed by simply adding the option to the main menu, the first one had it, that said, you can play every vocation on the same character this time around, and change your character s looks 3 times per playthrough, with an added chance every time you complete the game and go to ng+.About the Portcrystal DLC, okay, that one is just convenient, but hardly necessary, it s a single fast travel point marker, its best use is to place it wherever you need to go back to town for a second and picked up again when you resume your journey to do the same the next time it s needed. But it s hardly a unique item, there are 5 for each playthrough too, the first game allowed 10 to be placed at once, which could be achieved in the first ng+ run, and even if I m not 100% sure, I think it will be the same here.That said, DD2 is very similar to what DD1 was, and that wasn't a game for everybody (it's meant to be very old school, with long travels to immerse yourself into the world, and failed quests if you tackle on too much at once), nor should every game be, you can request a refund from steam if you've played less than 2 hours of a title. If you don't like the game, refund it and buy something you'll enjoy, but the first game showed me that if you stick for the long haul it gets way better, the first one is now one of my all-time favorite games.In short, give the game a chance, but if it's not your cup of tea, that's alright too, but maybe try to find out more about games before you buy them, no matter how much hype is formed around them.",1

Positive,"I'll start with the glaringly obvious issue.performance. If you don't have a beefy PC I'd recommend waiting to buy the game. There's a lot of misinformation going around involving the MTX and how they're the only way to earn X item. It sucks that it's even an option, sure, but by no means does it affect the overall gameplay experience whatsoever. They can be safely ignored and you can obtain the equivalent items in-game rather quickly in a natural manor. Now into a brief review. This game is an improvement over DD1 in every aspect and a game I 100% recommend to fans of the series once the performance issues get resolved. The open world feels very busy, which is rare for open worlds nowadays. The combat is so fluid and rewarding whilst also punishing you for not planning in advance with proper equipment and consumables. The random encounters you can run into lead to very funny situations and unique challenges to overcome. A small add-on, I appreciate that they transition the stat growth to your currently active vocation to encourage experimentation, this is a huge improvement to the first game.",1

Positive,"Dragons Dogma 2 is a great game, in my opinion. It does a lot of the same things as the first game, and a fair few new things as well - However it doesn't seek to be a sequel in the way a lot of people probably hoped. Dragons Dogma 2 doesn't really expand a whole lot on the original games vision, so much as do it again with a better budget. Combat wise, I think Dragons Dogma 2 and Dragons Dogma are on par with one another. Dragons Dogma 2 does a lot different, and while I prefer some of the ways DDDA handled it, the methods that Dragons Dogma 2 changes its combat are not bad and keep it just as fun as it was in the first game. Story wise, I Dragons Dogma 2 does a good job especially in the first and final third. I loved the early political intrigue at the start, and when it picks up again for the finale it hits hard. The second third of the game falls behind a bit but it doesn't get bad.Music wise, I personally really enjoy a fair few tracks. It isn't as unique as the original Dragons Dogma soundtrack, but as someone who will stop paying attention to a boss to hear its music, I found what music there was quite good. I specifically enjoyed the theme that plays for Griffons. Graphics wise, the game looks very good! Performance issues aside, I think the aesthetic of the game is very similar to that of the original in a way that I enjoy quite a lot. All in all, I am more than happy with the game Dragon's Dogma 2 turned out to be. However, this won't be able to replace Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen for me. If I was desperately wanting to play Dragons Dogma DA I would play that. If I was desperately wanting to play Dragons Dogma 2, I would play this. Some people might think thats a failing of Dragons Dogma 2, but I think its a sign that the games are both distinct and fun enough to be their own experience. Yeah I recommend Dragons Dogma 2. Until further notice, this is my GOTY. (All following text is from before I finished the game, a review meant primarily to inform people to actually try the game and choose whether or not they dislike it rather than bandwagon over an issue Capcom has been guilty of the entire time.)I typically don't like to review games before I finish them;However, I would like to make it known that a vast majority of the reviews being made are from people with less hours than I have at the time of writing this. This is a game that is at least 30+ hours long on first playthrough. None of the reviews have much basis in the quality of the game itself and are kneejerk reactions towards the things the Publishing side of Capcom are probably responsible for. Blame the higher-ups who actually see any profit from the people dumb enough to buy the stupid and unnecessary microtransactions - not the people who spent years making a game they are clearly proud of. Denuvo is an unfortunate reality, and hopefully they'll remove it in the future - you're allowed to not buy a game because of it, but so many people buying a game that has it just to leave a bad review and refund it is literal insanity. We've known for at least a month Denuvo was present.Performance issues are always subjective, everyones hardware is different, but i would like to point out the minimum and recommended specs for the game do, and have for awhile, listed that with those specs you can expect 30 FPS. They literally designed this game expecting people to get less than 60. Cap your FPS at 30, you'll probably be fine until they patch the game to run better. If you cannot bring yourself to play at 30 then I don't know what to tell you.",1

Positive,"Aright, At first i was sold of hooked with the game first couple of hours, but then it grew on on me and started enjoying the unrestrictedopen world, the same vibes i got from Elden Ring and Zelda BOTW & TOTK. However there were lots of cons that not everyone maylike of enjoy wither it was gameplay, story, quests etc.What i liked about the game as said above ^ as well as the sense of exploration, finding hidden caves and loot, it feels rewardingas it should be. you can easily lose track of your current objective and get lost and maybe unlock a hidden ability or skill for your selected vocation. i liked the idea of the pawns you get from other players as they can help you a lot in finding quest items that you might need to unlock powerful spells or abilities for you or your main pawn.Also the personality of the pawns are a little fun but can get boring really fast but oh well. As for the gameplay it is fun and enjoyable, you can feel a little of a power fantasy combat depending on your style. I myself enjoyed (as my main character) thief, warrior, mystic spearhand, Magic archer and another class i'm not gonna mention as to avoid any spoilers. I Loved how when you fight a boss on the road and out of nowhere a Griffin sweeps in an joins the fight and a blood bath starts, as i had fought 4 world bosses back to back with no camp rest and felt stressed but in a good way when being in a pinch with low healing items and HP bar, also riding the griffin or dragon when they run from fights is amazing with this type of open world.Now for the bad and shitty parts,Performance, am sure you already know its bad even if you have a high end pc it could still have drops especially in the starting main capital vernworth, my specs were r9 5900x and 3080 12gb. in there i get 30-45 frames with stutters, other cities were better for me and did not feel the drops that strong as in vernworth, not to mention that denuvo reduces the performance on top of the game being so big on most hardware.though i enjoyed the combat, it can be repetitive like when unlocking the best attack moves and skills then just spamming them, also the recovery in this game is so bad there is when getting stomped and having to wait for a pawn to pick you up or just crawl so slowly till you stand up, only the thief vocation can at least dodge but not the other vocations. just getting hit from behind and not being able to dodge can irritate some people, not to mention in early game and you pawns are busy, 3 mobs can just time their attacks back to back and you won't be able to do anything about in until help arrives LOL . type of monsters are so little and not a lot of verity just the same enemies in different locations and different colors with more hp, wish there was more with this big open world. weight system, i did not enjoy that at all especially when an open world games just gives you loot while traveling from point A to B and so on, you can't expect me to leave all that loot behind and comeback for when i might even forget about it. to be honest i just used MODS to render my weight light as a feather and get all the loot you want.Story line and quests,was not captivated with the story to be honest, found myself to skip the dialogues and just skip skip ok go here deliver this take me there bla bla bla. sure some quests can be a timed quest and can be failed and you cant get again is a cool idea, but at least show a timer or if it has a day or two for you to complete or fail. its fun not having the game hold your hand with the side quests or hidden ones, but at the very least just make a little bit more obvious.Exploration 9.5/10 Storyline/ quests 5/10gameplay 8/10if you use mods, you'll enjoy the game like i have.",1

Positive,"I'll preface by saying that DDDA is my favorite ARPG of all time, and still think it was snubbed by Skyrim.With that being said, please still listen as I'm being honest.This game is great. There's a lot to take in; great vistas, fluid combat, and improved AI over the last game. Pathing for pawns isn't always the best, especially on cliff climbing, but it is much improved from the base game 10 years ago. Yes, there's not as much skills that are equipped from your vocations, but it's replaced by more combat abilities that leave you moving through combat faster than the old game. This is probably a balance from DDO that they decided works better, and I'm inclined to agree in someways.That's not to say that this game doesn't have it's fair share of faults; This game is getting flamed hard by people who don't like the current state of game publishers pushing MTX. Anyone who has played the former DDDA or DDO know that all the items in the MTX market are base game finds, and that this is a cash grab to pick up whatever they can. Being that this is a single player game it feels foolish from a consumer's standpoint, just see Infinite Wealth (another game I beat.) On top of that the advertising for system specs can be a bit daunting; I have a 14700K and a 4070 TI Super with 64GBs DDR5 and I still chew through main cities at 30FPS 1% lows on 2160. It is demanding in it's optimization, but it's not by fault of your equipment. If you play on lower performance settings, like 1440, you're going to be better off. Open world and mid combat I have not dipped below 60FPS with my card only using around 65% to 90% of my GPU load. VRAM makes a difference here when running high settings, lemme tell you.In conclusion Capcom has delivered on a game no one thought would be made. I've pushed DDDA to a little over 2000 hours between three generations of consoles, and built a PC with this game in mind. If you were passionate about DDDA, you will most likely love the hell out of this and find it a breath of fresh air. For a casual consumer with no background of the previous titles, welcome to a grand story with very little handholding. For everyone else interested, streamers are playing the crap out of this for revenue stream, and YT has video upon video of people playing. Take that as you will and believe it's worth a shot.As for the negative press attention, choose to vote with your wallet. If you don't support useless MTX, don't buy. If you don't like the way games are moving forward with harder-to-reach equipment goals for budget players, don't buy. Whatever your reasons that make you feel disheartened about the title, please read the wiki for the story and save yourself the money, or wait until it's on a sale later. I wouldn't blame you.Thanks for coming to my TedTalk",1

Positive,"Had some doubts coming into this game as it's been a good amount of time since Dragon Dogma 1. So far with the 6 hours I put into this game, I really like it and it was everything ""Dragon Dogma"" that I liked and wanted so this is a thumbs up to me. The game is mostly negative at the time of this review for some reason and I'm not really sure why but I looked through some and here are my comments for it:bad optimisation / low FPS- Game is fine, keyboard is find, controller support is also fine, have no gotten a single crash yet, a good 70fps in my $600 PC, I see not preformance issues at all.Negative because micro transactions (weird descision but no way someone actually pays for them XD)- You can earn everything in game and it's really easy actually, and this is a single player game anyway so for people who actually pays money for this, is on you really. Also the micro transactions are just weird, rift crystals no reason for it unless you really want to summon a level 13 when your a level 4 to help you out so your a pussy basically. Wakestones to restore dead to life I haven't gotten that far into the game yet but there is really no need for this at all. The other stuff is cheap in game, so really no reason to spend money on that.pay two dollars every time i want to edit my character- You can do that in game, I can buy 9 character edits right now with the gold I have in game. And also at the start you can get 2 so unless you really need to change your character THAT much, you did it to yourself XDDDDDyou can start a new game- This part is a weird one for me, this is that type of game where you really don't need mutiple characters as you can littery do everything in one character. As for the ""OPPS, I mess up my character looks"" part, again you can do that in game and you start out with enough money to get 2 at the very start anyway XDIn conclusion, you just need to play the game yourself and not have these ""bad reviews"" which isn't really a real review to push you away from trying this game XD",1
Positive,"This is a hard one. Only 10 hours in and it s already becoming one of my favorite games ever. Yet, I almost quit when I arrived in a major city area because of the performance drop. I usually have a high pain tolerance in regard to fps, but going from fast anime level action paced fights when exploring to a slow, jittery fest when in the city is jarring. Thankfully, from what I played it looks like the issues are mostly contained to the big cities. If you re concerned, I would recommend waiting for patches before buying it, the game isn t going anywhere.Having said all of that, this is the most fun I had in an open world game since Elden Ring. Here is an average gaming session to showcase why: My party was composed of an archer (myself), a mage and a thief. I was missing a member, so I went to a riftstone to recruit a strong warrior pawn. I find one, add her to the team, then notice that her name is Muscle Mommy (MM). With a full team we made our way towards a quest until we spot an ogre locked in a fight with an NPC. We go to help them and a few seconds into the fight the creature starts salivating and acting more erratic. My pawn informs me that ogres are obsessed by women, but it s too late, the monster has already grabbed MM and is trying to crush her to death.At this point, I climb on his back and start stabbing him with an arrow from my quiver in an unsuccessful attempt to force him to release my companion. Then, out of nowhere, 3 NPCs joined the fight against the ogre, and, when I thought it couldn t get more chaotic, a pack of goblin ran towards us. What followed was one of the most cinematic scenes of combat I have ever been a part of with my archer fighting the goblins while my pawns and the NPCs were holding off the ogre. My main pawn unleashed thunder on it while MM and another fighter NPC climbed and stabbed its chest. In the end, Muscle Mommy got her revenge as she dealt the final blow. My party and the NPCs went on our separate ways, and we resumed questing.A couple of in-game days later, I go past the same road, and I see that the corpses of the ogre and goblins we fought are still there. It really feels like anything can happen, and I m surprised at how well all the systems in place are interacting together. Overall, if you love open world games and fast paced (borderline chaotic) combat, I would recommend Dragon s Dogma 2.",1
Positive,"Summoned Pawn:""I believe there's a shortcut around here somewhere""*Jumps off the cliff and plunges straight to their death in the waters below*My Pawn:""I'm sure we'll find a purpose for it in due time.""I highly oppose microtransactions in p2w environments, but everything can be easily obtained in game. As scummy as it is to even have these in the first place, it doesn't take anything out of my experience. I personally haven't run into any performance issues on my older gpu. Solid 50-70fps on high graphics. Gameplay has been amazing. Would recommend. i9-10850KGTX 1080 TI16GB RAM",1
Positive,"If enjoyed the first one, 100% you will enjoy this one: it's the first one with some upgrades. Don't understand negative reviews: denuvo?.who care?; cosmetic microtransactions? .who care?; one character? .who care? can have all vocations on one char. My only complain it's optimisation, but i'm sure will be fixed. Anyway, good game, but not for everyone. I will upload my full sorcerer playthrough on yt:",1
Positive,"After just completing the game, I would recommend this game to either fans of the past game or people who are simply aching for another action rpg to bite into. Otherwise, there are some glaring issues that make it hard to recommend to anyone else at the moment.PROS: - The Combat is still solid and about the same as DD1- The Game looks rather nice, some areas are a bit bland in detail.- The endgame was pretty cool and something I didn't expect, only gripe is that there is time pressure forced upon you that can keep you from exploring all that it adds.- The gameplay features are about what you would expect from any open world rpg, there are some things I wish didn't carry over from the first game but it's pretty solid.CONS:- A major con is the outdated one save only system. As it stands the only way to go back and fix a mistake is to revert to a inn save which can be up to HOURS of progress reverted. This also means that if you want to see an alternate ending to a quest or decision you make you have to either revert your progress significantly or do it during new game plus. Which honestly you probably won't want to do given the next cons.- The story was rather forgettable and honestly there were no characters that really stood out to me. Granted I didn't exactly play the first one for its story either but there is hardly a motivation to start the game again for a different outcome for characters I didn't really find a reason to care about.- Honestly it's kinda too easy. I don't mean that in a ""git good"" kinda way. To put it in perspective the level cap of your character and companion is from what I've heard Level 999. You could probably beat most of the game's enemies around level 20-30. After this the game is less ""can you win"" and more ""how long before you win"".- The enemy variety isn't terrible but when you get in a fight every 20 or so steps you can't help but tire of fighting the same enemy for the dozenth time in such a short timeframe.Sidenote: If you have a strong stance against microtransactions, by all means steer clear. From what I experienced it very much is a non-issue gameplay wise. It wasn't advertised ingame whatsoever and everything you can buy is almost laughably easy to obtain assuming you plan on playing more than 2 hours in total. If you can get past it even being a option, it won't have much effect on your game outside of not being able to immediately edit your character and companion right away. A bit annoying if you make a mistake creating your characters at the start.",1
Positive,"Overall: 8/10The game was super hyped when it came out and I was pretty hyped myself. The ""dlc"" are totally useless, it is just to be there I guess. you can get the content of the ""dlc"" for 500 gold or find them pretty easy, the map is not that large to have tons of waypoints, the drama around it was unnecessary. The only problem was the fps on towns oh god.The game is pretty interesting and fun to play overall.Positive:-A lot of side things to do, side quests, tasks, quests that gives you interesting items, it is a nice way to make you explore and find things along your journey.-Fighting is quite fun, with a lot of classes and abilities and you can feel the difference between them the warrior is a bulky and slow huge damage dealer, the archer must be away or it will be unable to shoot arrows, those kind of feelings, the only things is the limited equipped abilities.-Changing classes so easily super fun, you will not be bored.-The last vocation the wayfarer is INSANE it was super fun to play as.-Achievements mean something and it was super fun to do 100%, every achievements is attached to some part of the lore or things you should experience.-True ending is interesting with a good twist.Neutral:-For me it is negative but the game was super easy in terms of difficulty.Negative:-Story is super short and not that amazing, before the ending.-Travelling gets boring, getting to face all the same enemy all the time in the same place.-Affinity is super annoying to manage and have affinity with people.-Ferrystones are kind of expensive on the beginning and limited to buy 1 at each store each day or so.-Fps around towns are so low. hope they fix it.Final thoughts:It is a pretty fun game, drakes are cool :D",1
Positive,"Some valid CPU performance complaints aside, Dragon's Dogma 2 is a genuine joy to explore. If you're in the mood for a game that feels like an adventure you're going to be hard-pressed indeed to find something better. The way its myriad systems interact has left me delighted and surprised time and again, and I've still only scratched the surface.I'll write a longer review eventually but honestly? Right now I'd much rather get back to playing.",1
Positive,I got this at launch and kind of let it sit untouched until now.The most recent patch as of the date of this review fixed any performance problems I had with the game and it runs as well as any other RE Engine title.,1

Positive,"If you only have 2h in game dont cry about microtrans, you can buy all in game.Micro is for ppl who cant be bothered to play the game real.Needs optimalization but all in all great game, its DD1 with a new map.",1
Positive,"Incredibly fun game with amazing combat and visuals. My biggest complaint is only one save slot. That is big dumb. I get it is because of the pawn system, but just make us use the same pawn or something or only one active pawn. the ""microtransactions"" can all be gotten in-game pretty dang easily but they still shouldn't be dlc, its basically just a cash grab for anyone who doesn't know how the games works which is incredibly predatory.",1
Positive,"A worthy successor to the original Dragon's Dogma.Pawns are professional cliff divers, battles are chaotic, ragdolls are hilarious, bow/dagger classes are still outrageously powerful, world is beautiful, story is fun. Classes are, in most ways, a marked improvement over their original counterparts. Especially Warrior, which now feels completed. Even fighting unarmed is entertaining. There's no need for an animation for sprinting into a wall while carrying an enemy, but it's there and it's great.Micro-transactions have been a part of videogames for a long time now. They have stayed because they work and make money. I won't reward their existence with my money, but I won't ""punish"" a game I love for it either. Kitting out my pawn with a good weapon, snazzy armour and a decent weaponskill/augment loadout nets me all the rift crystals I'll ever need.By the end of it, even the strongest monsters will be downed within 30 seconds using the right moves on just about any class. The way of Dragon's Dogma simply is for your damage output to become apocalyptic. That said, if they did throw in a hard mode and/or New Game+ scaling (both with an emphasis on increased enemy HP and defence) then I'd be the happiest man alive.Make sure your rig has a solid CPU or wait for optimisation patches, and if you're a fan of the original Dragon's Dogma or just action RPGs like this in general then I'm confident this game won't disappoint.",1
Positive,"NEGATIVES:- Performance goes from 80ish fps for me in the open world areas to 45 or 50fps in the two big cities, this is the games biggest issue. Fix this & I will be playing for hundreds of hours!- The very start, first 5 or 10 minutes are kind of boring and janky and not a great introduction to things (Thankfully, the other 10 hours I have played have been simply amazing!)- The Story is pretty average- Could use a little more variety in enemies, hopefully an expansion improves this!POSITIVES:- Wonderful combat, probably my favorite real time combat in a roleplaying game ever. Really nice improvement over the first games combat to, which was already good- Epic sounding soundtrack that fits everything going on around you so well- The Pawns are improved alot, they are actually pretty smart and very useful now!- Graphics are a nice improvement from the last game, especially some of the views in the open world areas!- Voice work is top notch, I would say 95% of the voice work is A1- Movement is great, it feels good - Controls are good- Lots of wonderful abilities for you and your pawns, really fun to use them all!- Game world is wonderfully crafted- Immersion and atmosphere are top notch- I love the random things that can happen out in the open world in this game, so well done!- The Big enemies are so fun to tackle, weither you are climbing them and attacking them or picking up explosives and blowing up a dam to mess with a huge Cyclops, its all so good!- So many ways to tackle enemies and missions, I love it!- AI for the enemies is very good (Same with the Pawns!)- Exploration is super fun and you are rewarded well for it- Character Creation is really well done, one of the best ever, LOVE IT!- The last two Boss fights where fantastic! Loved them! Barely had any healing left!As you can see by the list of positives I have above, I am having just a ball on this game, I usually prefer turnbased combat for rpgs but man oh man, this is without a doubt the best real time combat I have ever played in a roleplaying game. The Pawns are also super useful and great to have around, as they fight or find people or items for you for quests.Played for 10 hours so far and man what an adventure! Loving it! Other than there needing to be improvement to the performance when in the two big cities, there is not much else I can complain about.Honestly liking nearly everything about this game so far! From the wonderful combat, to the improved Pawn AI, to the epic sounding soundtrack, to the wonderful movement, the good dialogue and all the cool abilities you have to get things done. This is already a masterpiece of a roleplaying game for me.Other than performance going down in the two big cities and the opening 5 minutes at the very start in the mining area which felt boring and not a great introduction to things. But as soon as you get into the world and into that first village and surrounding areas, it is simply amazing and alot of fun. Also the main issue I have which I mentioned above is the performance dip in the two big cities.I ended up doing a handful of side quests there in the first village where you get your pawns (Make sure to get 3 of them!) before even doing the first big main mission. Then you head off to the first big city in the game and it is quite the adventure getting there, had a blast fighting off a hue Cyclops, tossing my Pawns 15 feet in the air to get a chest and lower the ladder and fighting other groups of enemies along the way, so much fun getting there.The two big cities though are the two area's where the game needs the most optimization. I get good FPS out in the open world (80ish fps), but then when I got to this first big city, FPS tanked down to 50 fps. If they can fix this issue, I can see myself playing hundreds and hundreds of hours of this wonderful game.Most fun I have had in an rpg since Baldurs Gate 3 and Elden Ring to be honest! I played the first game on Xbox 360 and enjoyed it but wasn't blown away. But I am blown away with this game so far. Been playing rpg's since the 80's and yup, without a doubt my favorite combat in a non turnbaed rpg ever (Usually prefer Turnbased over Real time, but this is FANTASTIC! And a nice improvement over the first game's combat).Make your self a character, make a Pawn, hire two other pawns and get out there Adventurer, you have a world to save!Played over 10 hours now and just like BG3 and Elden Ring before it, I have been blown away by how addicting this game is! I am totally 100% hooked now on this game and already thinking about getting back on and getting in more fights with my wonderful Pawns!As for the negativity about Microtransactions? Its a singleplayer game, others buying stuff to make the game easier or make there characters look better has never bothered me, unless its for an advantage in a Multiplayer/Online/PVP game (Lost Ark, NBA2k,etc.). I won't ever buy a Microtransaction that gives you an advantage (Multi or singleplayer) but that doesn't mean i will get angry or offended if others want to make a game slightly easier for themselves, that effects me and my save file in NO way at all. Capcom has been doing this with the Resident Evil remakes lately to, so nothing new. I won't ever buy any extra silly stuff but I won't trash the game for it either. NOW. Where was all this backlash for MTX when Capcom did this exact same thing with The Resident Evil remake games? Or we only care about this when DD2 does it?Anyways, those are my thoughts from the first 10 or 11 hours on the game, I will report back after a few more days of playing, but so far its two big thumbs up, even with the performance going from around 80ish fps in the open areas to 50fps in the big cities, I am still loving this game to bits. If they can get the performance better in those two big cities, I will be playing so much more of this gameRefunding this never crossed my mind for a second, fantastic combat, awesome graphics,etc. really the only thing I want improved is the performance in big cities!If you want a mix of Elden Ring, Witcher 3 and Dragon's Dogma you must give this game a try, top notch roleplaying here!**Just beat the game, loved it overall! Loved the game world, the combat is amazing, the immersion is great, but the game needs work with performance and the story is average. I played about 10-12 hours in Ofline mode on top of the time Steam Shows**",1
Positive,"Alright, I'm going to cut through all the bull about ""muh microtransactions"" or |muh one save files"" or ""muh performance"" and I'm going to give you the most honest review that I can.I'm going to get the biggest elephant in the room out of the way first. We've all seen a lot of complaints over this with not much context backing this up, so: the microtransaction DLC stuff you see on the store page is all stuff you can acquire within the first hour or two of playing the game. Wakestones, rift crystals, the ability to reset your character's appearance, you can get all that stuff within the first couple hours. I've honestly never seen a series of microtransactions so utterly pointless to buy since. well, to be honest, the first Dragon's Dogma. Yeah, you heard me right: the first Dragon's Dogma. In fact, Capcom seems to have gone to some lengths to directly copypaste the DDDA MTXs, and they were just as pointless there too.As for the presentation: there is none. None of it's remotely in-your-face at all.Now that I've established that the dreaded microtransactions are the most pointless purchases known to man, let's move on to something a bit weightier; and if this is still a dealbreaker, I'm sorry but I'm also glad we got it out of the way early.Okay, yeah, this one's actually a solid negative from me. I can run most games of similar graphical fidelity at a solid 60-80 FPS on max settings (or near enough). Dragon's Dogma II struggles to make 30 on medium-high for me. That being said, I'm also a former console player so I don't really care that much as long as the framerate is consistent, which DD2 can. usually accomplish unless it's loading in graphic-intensive areas, in which case I drop to 15-20 for a few seconds.If that's a dealbreaker. well, I'm sorry, but I'm also glad we got it out of the way now.Yeah, it's a bummer, but it was also present in the first game, so I don't know what to tell you here.I'm going to lump this all into one category here - sorry about that, it's just how I'm rolling.I'm not gonna sugarcoat it. This game is DDDA but bigger, meatier, and with the names and some of the small details changed around. That's it. It's not a sequel (unless there's some hidden boss 80 hours in or something); it's a remake. I honestly blame the marketing team here.That being said, I really can't say anything more than what I already did. It's DDDA with moderate to large improvements across the board. If you liked the first game, you'll probably like this one (unless any of the above categories were dealbreakers). If you didn't like the first game, there probably won't be much to recommend with this one.The voice acting is moderately improved from the first game - we've gone from an average and serviceable 4.5-5.5/10 to a decent-but-not-outstanding 6.5-7/10 in that regard. The dragon continues to be awesome. The dialogue continues to be presented in a somewhat archaic syntax/delivery that most people seem to be annoyed by but I find oddly charming. The core gameplay is essentially the same as the first game from what I can tell - but hey, if it ain't broke, why bother fixing it?The story is. the names and faces are different, but the broad strokes seem to be the same. There's still the big capital city about halfway down the eastern shoreline on the map, except this time you start in the north instead of the south. But the broad strokes are similar enough to where I was able to map my progress by comparing the DDDA quest progression (i.e. ""oh yeah, A quest here was just X quest from DDDA, so B quest here will probably fill the same role as Y quest from the first game)"" and so far that's been essentially borne out.I like it. Solid buy, glad I got it. That being said, I'm fully aware of what made me like the game might turn other people off. But if you liked DDDA and nothing of what I typed here is a turnoff for you, DD2 is probably worth checking out.DD2 is DDDA but bigger and better and I can high-five my pawn sometimes and that's all I really wanted out of another Dragon's Dogma game. But if you don't like that, I completely understand.",1
Positive,"The negative comments are very largely exaggerated. The paid DLC is a trap for whales, and all of the items are freely available in-game for very cheap. The game is smooth and fluid 90% of the time and is excellent fun. I have a hard time logging off because I just want to see what could be over the next hill.Strengths:ExplorationCombatFun pawnsFreedom of choiceWeaknesses:Some stuttering once the game has been on for a whileSometimes I don't know where to go next, but then I pick a direction, and it all works outGet the game.

Positive,10/10 Best Meat Graphics,1
Positive,The sort of game that's so good and unique that you can only expect something of this caliber once a decade.,1
Positive,very good game even you the micro transactions in a single player game really put me off but they arent needed and certainly not aggressive like diablo 4 to get you to buy stuff. I have no idea how you even buy the dlc in the game its not come up. The combat is great though a auto lock would be nice or at least parshal. Difficulty in fighting could be raised more like elden ring though maybe not that hard lol but yeah defo worth a buy ! not far in but ill give it a solid 9,1
Positive,"Honestly, this is already the front runner for Game of the Year. Do yourself a favor and jump in blind. You won't regret it. It's one the best games I've ever played in the genre. Dragon's Dogma 1 fans will be ecstatic. Newcomers will be equally happy with the experience. Do yourself a favor, and buy a game that's worth the price. Buy Dragon's Dogma 2.None of the microtransactions are needed, and honestly, they're a total waste to buy. There is so much to this game already, and everything can be found in game.I'm so heartbroken at the moment, because behind the curtains is one of the best games ever. Then CAPCOM decided to do this crap with Microtransactions. They're trying to do their best impersonation of Ubisoft.",1
Positive,"Much like DD1/DA, Dragon's Dogma 2 is a polarizing experience. Much like DDDA, I love it, so much.What do you get if you play Dragon's Dogma the sequel?Fantastic party-based combat built around giving every blow an impact, and every move a weightSmall enemies that cooperate, large enemies that overpowerLarge and varied open world full of enemies to fightPawn system, where you create your personal supporting party member and raise them throughout the game, both by traditional means (buying skills and gear), and non-traditional ones (teaching by example, exposing enemy weakness, exploration paths, item locations)Nine unique player classes with clear roles and distinct abilitiesA plotline and a large number of, often rather hidden and nonlinear, quests that are decent but most of the time just an excuse to interact with the combat system moreVoice acting that's mid to decent onlyWhat do you NOT get if you play Dragon's Dogma 2: Draconic boogaloo?Dark Arisen againWitcher 4Baldur's Gate 4Elden Ring 2In-town framerates above mid-40",1
Positive,"The microtransactions suck, straight upHowever, they do not compromise the experience, everything that is a microtransaction is something you can obtain in game. I do not believe the game was designed around microtransactions at all, as buying a lot of these (e.g. revives, teleport crystals) ruins the experience a bit, as both of these items are something you'd acquire more slowly, and force you to travel on your feet or be more cautious about your encounters. The first game was like this too.Capcom being capcom, mtx sucks, but it doesn't compromise the experience, do not buy the mtx and encourage this behaviour, but this is also a gem of a game",1
Positive,"Worth the wait, an overall improvement from the first game, and I still kind of can't believe I'm playing Dragon's Dogma 2.All of the 'DLC' that people are losing their minds over are obtainable in game, Capcom did the same with DMC 5 and that game is sitting at Overwhelmingly Positive reviews.",1
Positive,"I've been liking it a lot so far. I don't like that it still limits you to just one character and save file, and I've definitely had fps drops in the capital city down as low as 30fps at times, but out in the open world where I'm doing most of my questing and fighting, it runs pretty steady. I feel like the Pawns are smarter and more useful in this game than the last one. I like that they can be specialized to gain new abilities like using items on others rather than just themselves or finding and combining ingredients to drown you in an ocean of Salubrious Droughts and other potions. Even better than any of that, Pawns that have discovered something in another world will try to physically lead you to hidden chests and locations they know about, but your other Pawns don't. Conversely, if you're exploring and find a hidden thing, the hired Pawns will remark about needing to relay that back to their own masters-presumably implying they will lead other players to it if those players get close in their worlds. There's a Pawn quest and badge system where you can request other players complete a specified quest with your Pawn if they hire it and offer a reward from your inventory or some gold as thanks. Quests as easy as just adventuring together for an in game day or hunting a specific monster like a cyclops. Cause if my Pawn hunts 30 cyclops for example, it will get a badge for that and presumably be able to offer more useful methods of hunting them for me and other players who might hire it. At least according to the tooltip about it in the game, anyway. You can also gift equipment to other players' Pawns by equipping it to them. It sends their currently equipped gear to that player's inventory and gifts then equips the new piece each time. This allows you to try out new gear and upgrade it for random players or friends' Pawns. In addition, you can find these golden beetles out in the world and when used, they permanently increase yours or your main Pawn's carrying capacity by a set amount each time.As far as the combat goes, I've been playing the Archer vocation and liking it a lot. I have to craft or buy the various special arrows I'd need for those related skills. To use my explosive arrow skill for example, I need to combine withered branches and a sunbloom to make 5 of them, or buy them from a vendor. I like it cause it feels like you're not relying on or spamming them and instead using other skills more. Ones that fire in a wide area, or rapidly in succession-stuff like that. I made a Mage Pawn to keep my party healed and enchant our weapons with fire or lightning. It feels like it's more active about all of that stuff. Instead of getting my weapons enchanted as the combat's already over, they're on it usually by the time I've fired my 2nd or 3rd shot and will change it seemingly to the situation. It could have been coincidence, but as an example, they don't use fire when it's raining it seems. They use lightning cause everything is drenched and weaker to lightning. The other 2 Pawns I currently have hired are a another Archer to help me hit flying enemies, and a big brute warrior to bully things around and help carry a bunch of stuff. Cause now you have to carry a camping kit if you wanna make use of the many camping sites dotted around the map and recover lost max hp.The game has something called a loss gauge and you'll be losing max hp as you take damage and the longer you go without resting, the more of your total hp is capped by the lost gauge, making all forms of healing less worth using and combat overall more dangerous. I've had all the way up to half my max hp lost from stupidly wandering around without bringing a camping kit. I could've used a ferrystone to fast travel back to town, but that would've been a waste of 10k.Speaking of, there are some vendors who sell the fast travel items and you can get them as quest rewards or find them out in the world, but they are half the price of the house I just bought in game before writing this review. I watched some lady's house in game for a week getting free night's stay and a place to access my items like an inn, then she sold it to me for 20k, the price of 2 ferrystones, or a couple pieces of decent gear from a shop, Chest gear and weapons have been costing over 10k each and the average helmet and pants are 5k and up unless you wanna buy inferior gear for some reason. You can upgrade armor and weapons and doing so also makes them weigh less so definitely do that as much as you can. A lighter inventory helps with stamina and move speed. You don't wanna be caught in combat with a heavy inventory. That said, the couple of times I had a heavy inventory, the Pawns in my group came up to me and distributed things among themselves to lighten my load. Did they do that in the last game? No, right? I can't remember.Anyway, the intro to this game-I also think it's better than the last one's was. Starting out, playing your newly created character, being introduced to the Pawns, and going all the way to the capital for the first time-everything about it, I feel has been done better in this game than the original. I hated the intro in the first game. I always felt like the game really only got worth investing time into once you made it to the capital for the first and it really opens up. This one starts letting you get lost in side quests and exploration pretty much immediately upon getting the Pawns. I think the first little town I went to was the one where I got a side quest teaching me how to combine items using recipes in this game and make or buy an item for this girl who wanted to learn how to make them for her family's apothecary shop in the capital. Later when I got to the capital, she gave me the specialization chirurgeon for my Pawn that lets it use items on others of it's own accord. I'm curious to see what other specializations and what conditions unlock them. It feels like there's so much more hidden stuff in the opening area leading up to the capital in this game. I know it's over a decade later and technology has improved a lot, but still. Technology didn't force the original's intro to be that boring and linear.If you liked the original, you probably will like this one too. If you never played the original, I still recommend this game. Don't take it the wrong way, but I liken it to Elden Ring in that it is probably a great entry for newcomers to the kind of game this is. I think within the first few hours of playing this game and having someone's Pawn encourage you to follow it to random locations and treasure, plus all of them helping you fight in combat, you'll know whether or not this is the kind of game you'd wanna keep putting more hours into. By the time you've got a dozen or so hours into it, you'll probably have already made over 100k gold in game, replaced and upgraded all your gear and your Pawn's gear as much as possible, and collected 4 or 5 fast travel items, a couple wakestones (revive items) and a couple fast travel locations to warp between. You might also have taken the ox cart fast travel system a couple times as well. Whatever you've done, hopefully it was entertaining enough to wanna keep playing because this one feels much more like an adventure game than the last one in that you're resting up til morning or night and then heading off to do a quest or 2 before you rinse and repeat and feels more like you're living the life of an adventurer in the game than the last one. I know you're supposed to be the Arisen and have a grand destiny to fight the dragon like in the last game-but I care more about all the fun you have in the game along the way to that final fight than that ultimate fight itself, usually. This feels already like a more memorable adventure than the last one just from all these side quests I've done and how they've ultimately been impacting things in other ways. (Like getting a house or Pawn specialization.)(Out of room for more review.)",1
Positive,"Amazing game, but not yet polished; it should have undergo another 6-12 months of development before release.Pros:- Vast world with extensive exploration opportunities.- Phenomenal combat with numerous classes and skills, highly dynamic and engaging.- Evokes the feeling of a Lord of the Rings adventure.- Minimal loading times.- Efficient travel via ox carts.- Numerous caves that will give you the creeps.- Graphics that are easy on the eyes.- Exciting griffin riding.- Many fun and challenging enemies.- Epic-looking spells (if you choose to be a mage or sorc).- Discovery of new and interesting allies roaming the world.- Offers numerous gameplay options, providing a sense of freedom.Cons:- Performance issues, including FPS drops in large cities and random crashes and freezes.- Game save system is cumbersome and restrictive.- Can t create a new character without deleting the old one.- Followers often die or disappear unexpectedly.- Ox carts are fragile and prone to destruction.- Stamina mechanics can be frustrating sometimes.- Casting spells feels excessively slow.- Some reviewers complain about microtransactions, though this may not be a significant concern for all players. You can ignore micros altogether.TL/DR: Consider purchasing this game for a good ARPG experience, or wait another year for a potentially smoother experience (hoping for bug and performance fixes).",1
Positive,"Dragon's Dogma 2 managed to perfectly recreate the feeling of playing a classic game again for the first time. I love literally everything about this game and cannot put it down. Yeah, seeing the list of micro-transactions on the store page is pretty disappointing, however every single item listed there is incredibly easy to acquire in game. It's clear the dev's were forced to add micro transactions and maliciously complied as there is not a single time playing this game you'd ever think ""Man I need to buy xyz from the cash shop."" It's really unfortunate seeing so many negative reviews for this game, it seems pretty clear to me that a lot of people started bashing it before playing the game or before even acquiring accurate information on how the game functions. Please do your own research before jumping on the bandwagon of hate for a game that does not deserve it at all.",1

People raged at the microtransactions but they don't actually impact the game in any way as all items are found during normal play in plentiful quantity. The PC version is said to have performance issues but I personally didn't notice any on my high end machine.",1
Positive,"I was looking forward to this game for a long time and now that its here i'm still excited and having a great time.I'm currently on vacation and using a laptop with a 2070 (which is less than recommended) but have had no fps or performance issues at all, the game has ran great for me thus far and one i'm back home on my main rig i'll max everything out and if its any different update this review.Lots of people are condoning the micro transactions which are for purchasing items that are insanely easy to obtain through normal means in game, in the case of the rift crystals you literally can't avoid getting them, they're handed out for literally any task completion. so if you don't like them, don't buy the items and you'll have literally lost out on nothing and probably be happier as a person.",1
Positive,"I really, REALLY don't want to encourage Capcom's anti-consumer behavior but that being said, Dragon's Dogma 2 is not a ""mixed"" game in my opinion. It is fantastic, marred by some technical issues and bottom feeding monetisation.DO pick up this game but DO NOT purchase the paid ""convenience"" items. Even if you really want that port crystal, don't encourage them, just Google where to find them normally and spoil a little bit of the game for yourself if it means that much to you. Capcom should not be rewarded for sabotaging their developer's projects to surgically prey on FOMO and intentionally inconvenienced players.",1
Positive,"Absolutely stellar followup to Dragon's Dogma. They've improved the gameplay experience in every way while keeping its core identity fully intact. This is the most engrossing open world RPG experience I have played in some time, there's so much to do and see! I'm 12 hours in and haven't even managed the second step on the main quest. Something bad happened to an early quest NPC and he died, leaving me to find the capital on my own. This was awesome, because it took me on such unexpected twists and turns, venturing through unexplored territory and into the thick of danger. Bandit dens, goblin caves, saurian spawning pools, even a chimera nest (after one fraught attempt that ended in utter defeat, I left that one sleeping and got the heck out of there). I even found an ancient pedestal guarded by a wight! Stole his book and ran the heck out of there, couldn't hurt him at all yet. I haven't been this knocked out and impressed by an open world title since The Witcher III, or Skyrim before that. Really it feels more like Oblivion felt all those years ago, or maybe even Morrowind. Feels like the start of an amazing journey. I highly recommend it.Note: The DLC is unnecessary but you can buy it if you want. Don't think they're tuning the game to suck without it. They had the same kinds of DLC for Dragon's Dogma 1 at launch in 2012.",1
Positive,"I love this game. The ideas, the pawns system, actions and reactions to your actions, comments. Game doesn't rush you anywhere, so you can take your time, plan things and do as you please. Every journey is a new experience. There is some micromanagement with inventory of your crew, which could be optimized in many ways, but it's a minor issue.I'm sure game will be optimized through several patches and some things will be tweaked, so I suggest to give it a try. It's a beautiful & challenging world out there. Have fun.",1
Positive,"HUGE GAME, 20 hours in and I'm always getting sidetracked. I fell in love with the first one and fell more in love with this one. Whoever cries about the microtran should not but the game as you don;t deserve to play this gem, you find all the stuff in game anyways.FPS is a bit lacking but it never ruined my experience with a 3070",1
Positive,"There are so many bad reviews of this game that really don't do this game justice. I didn't look at any reviews for this game when it came out, I bought it and downloaded it day one and haven't looked back. Most of the reviews are people complaining about micro transactions and performance issues, other than some slight stuttering when I enter towns I don't have much issue. Compared to all recent titles that have disappointed me, its hard to trust game developers these days. I loved the first game and this one has met my expectations and then some, blown them out of the water. The improved and more satisfying combat, the separation and improvement of classes, (rangers are bow only) some people don't like it but I think it adds a little more variety.The story can be taken at your own pace and is very satisfying.I love the first game and have been doing multiple playthroughs over the years so I noticed changes in systems and gameplay. You can make the story up as you go with random encounters on the road, makes the game feel more alive. I felt like I could really get into the role of my character and had spent hours on the character creator alone perfecting that master piece. If you loved the first game you will love this one, and if you are new to the game than I think that this will breathe new life into you with a fresh experience and you will be pleasantly surprised. I have a pretty good PC. Its not a super computer but it gets the job done and I don't have much performance issues and only crashed once after 61 hours (it crashed last night before I went to bed.) I am sorry if this review seems a little long winded and all over the place, but I just had to get this review out there because you are seriously missing out if you don't give this game a shake. Most games are not perfect at the start of launch and that has pretty much set the standard for games today, and I feel that Dragons Dogma 2 has broke that practice standard.I'm not saying that the game is perfect but I have seen a lot worse from other AAA gaming companies.I have also needed to upgrade my PC for some previous titles before, Like Elden Ring. So before you complain about performance, maybe see if something is bottle necking you, or adjust your settings.Any way I am done typing now, want to go play this game some more, buy it or don't, you're only hurting yourself.",1
Positive,performance is great since the last patch,1
Positive,Great game. I don't need to pay $2 because I read the instructions.,1
Positive,"So to start this review there's been some discussion about Drag Dog 2's ""P2W"" microtransactions and. I don't see it. Like this isn't defending the monetization i'm just saying the shit they offer seems. useless? I get plenty of fast travel stones, I get plenty of harpy lures and I never really need them, and i've never hurt for riftstones.The summary for those who don't want to read that: microtransactions bad, but also pointless and not P2W.But the game itself is just as glorious as the first game. The hits feel chunky and satisfying, the sound design is immaculate, the enemies are interesting to fight with the climbing system. It's a big sprawling RPG that met my expectations quite well.",1
Positive,"THE ONLINE STORE RUINED THIS GAME'S LAUNCH SINGLE-HANDEDLY! I got this game gifted by a friend hoping I would enjoy it and honestly I want to buy it for them back just to enjoy the experience with someone else. This game is so remarkable, and I genuinely forget that you can buy (one-time purchase) items in the online shop that basically just let you fast travel and literally nothing else. Please, if you even moderately enjoyed the first game (which I only started playing after playing this game), this game will absolutely please you in some regard. And if you're new the franchise like myself, it's an even better experience.",1
Positive,"Game runs fine for me with max settings and RT on. With regards to the negative reviews pertaining to paid DLC, you don't have to buy any of it and there isn't anything there that isn't in game (including the appearance change voucher).Considering there is over $500 worth of DLC available for Monster Hunter World and Rise and pay-to-win DLC in Resident Evil Remakes 2, 3 and 4, those games remain beloved. I think a lot of the negative press surrounding this is misguided.I can't disagree that the optimization could be better, but this is a next gen game and at some point, graphic fidelity and physics will need to take a step forward.I went in on the Deluxe version and haven't felt burned yet. 10/10.",1
Positive,"If you like the feel of dragons dogma this game can be the game for you. but you have to be okay with the shortcomings of the first game as well as lackluster story. Beware the cost of this game on your computer, I run this game at near the lowest settings with 30 fps.",1

Positive,GAME CORRECTLY JUDGED ME AS BEING A MASSIVE GAYLORD 10/10,1
Positive,"Amazing game, only valid complaint is that you just have 1 save file. The combat is fun, the vocations are varied, and the map design is beautifully done. Microtransactions are probably forced by CapCom as a company. Nonetheless, the developers did an outstanding job on the game itself, and you can find all microtransaction items easily in the game itself. Just give it a go!",1
Positive,"Excellent! I was one of the few to play the first one, when it came out like 15 years ago I played it because it was an RPG, boy it was a handful at the time, I never quite got to finish it because I was active duty but I loved it because it was hard and had to really think about what you were doing throughout the game! This one is much better started out interesting but has taken off and boy talk about an adventure It does not hold your hand at all which I love! Play it buy it you won't regret it but be prepared to lose yourself in it. The only problem I have is I cannot make another character and restart the game since I have made a few mistakes but I am sure when the first major patch comes out this will be corrected because right now you can only make 1 character and cannot restart your game at all!",1
Positive,"Despite all the negative reviews concerning the micro transactions, which are rightfully so. The game is really good.Don't see a point or a reason for those type of micro transactions since everything offered is actually really easy to obtain just by simply playing the game.I haven't played the first game at all, so this is new to me. I really love the Pawn system. It's really cool that the pawns learn from their Arisen and then bring what they learned to you and help you throughout your journey. I like that they engage you with you and the environment. But sometimes it can be frustrating when they keep pointing out a ladder that you've already passed by like 10 times. Or even a ladder that somewhere that you can't see. I like the vocations a lot. They each are very different and they all seem fun to play. Started with Thief, and now switched to the Mystic Spearhand. It's beneficial to play multiple Vocations as you can use their augments for your build. I guess if there's something that I'm not a fan of, but not really that big of a deal, is the travel system. I'm still pretty early on, and I'm enjoying the adventure and exploration. But perhaps once I'm way more advanced into the story, travelling could be annoying? All in all, I 100% recommend this game to anyone and everyone.",1
Positive,"Game runs very smooth (if you have actual High End Hardware). Graphics are amazing (again, if you have actual High End Hardware). Gameplay-DragonsDogma Feeling-> 100%. Microtransactions meh, im not a fan of it but nobody force you to buy them.Update/Edit as im deeper into the game.",1
Positive,"this game is sick, idk why everyone hates it",1
Positive,"Ngl, this game is fun as fuck",1
Positive,The game is quite good. But after 10 hours every aspect of the game is so bady made for long time play. The fov makes you sick. The constant jabber from pawns makes you crazy. Its so many idiotic things that you can fix with mods. Play with mods.,1
Positive,"Just purchased it 9.24. After reading all the other complaints; maybe its because I'm playing it now mostly patched up, on a decent rig, but this is one heck of a game. Loved the first one, 20 hours into the second one and I'm absolutely hooked. Yes the micro-transactions are stupid, and anti-consumer, but that somehow doesn't detract from the overall experience. If you ever played Morrowind, I'll use that as a comparison. That game is showing its age now, but if you played it back in the day it gave you this feeling of a living world that you had to figure out, tame, and eventually conquer. DD2 gives me that same feeling, venturing out of town and finding my own adventure.",1
Positive,"$70 is a little steep in my opinion, and there's some genuine performance issues in heavily populated areas of the game. But the combat is extremely fun, and the story surprisingly intriguing for a game like this. The pawn system is a unique and fun concept that they really cooked with, though I do wish their banter didn't get so repetitive. Genuinely grew a little attached to the random pawns I nicked from other players. I could fight bosses in this game all day and not get bored. All of the classes seem pretty good, though I haven't tried every single one. Just when I think 'damn this class is completely broken and wild' I try a new one, and discover some new completely bananas way to play the game.Yes, the microtransactions are stupid and cringe. No, they do not impact the game in any way. You do not have to buy any of them.In short, game is good if a little flawed due to performance issues. Denuvo sucks, stop putting Denuvo in your games please. Thank you.",1
Positive,"Counter balancing some of the silly reviews, this game has one unforgivable aspect currently, and that's performance, while I will be rating this game as worth it, I whole heartedly agree with anyone who disagrees due to performance issues, this game should not require such expensive graphics cards and CPUs to run well, this is an engine known for giving an amazingly stable FPS, it should be offering that currently, but it isn't.So while if I were purely judging the game based off that currently, I would be negative as well, but as I am not, and to me the entire product past this is a glowing positive, I will simply say this game is worth it, I've been an avid fan of Dragon's Dogma since the PS3, I've loved it for years for the unique premise, and it's what I wanted to see return in this, the Pawns, the combat, everything is as I remember and tuned ever so better now, I am perfectly happy with the game. So for any of you who are on the fence, understand the performance is horrid, yell at Capcom as much as you possibly can because if they can get their shit together and fix it, this is one of the greats, if it weren't in this situation at launch we'd all be happy, for now we will have to weather the storm that is this shitty optimization til they buckle down and fix.",1
Positive,"The game is a ton of fun. Really captures that feeling of setting out on a grand fantasy adventure. The bow is satisfying, and I look forward to trying out Sorcerer and Mystic Spearhand once I unlock them. Combat is addictive, we'll see if it gets stale at some point but right now I'm seeking out enemies just because I enjoy the feeling of it. There's some weirdness, like how they outright removed Mystic Knight, the redone Thief doesn't feel at all like Assassin, etc. But that aside, if you liked DD1, you'll like DD2. Easy as that. (And OG DD1 players will be used to the framerate issues haha)The framerate is rough, but not unplayable (by this I mean 60+ fps, not ideal, but playable) since the only time it really tanks is in town (which is rough, 25-40 fps usually) but I've not had to spend too much time there, maybe 2 hours of my playtime so far? Also, I have had one crash in the ~16 hours I played. Obviously if they never fix this, it'll affect my opinion more. For now they have the benefit of the doubt since their other games run well (outside of issues like the rainy town visit in RE4R.) Microtransactions in any game suck, but it's not a big issue here since it's all so common that it would be a waste to spend the money, even more-so than usual. Most of it is stuff that was from the Deluxe Edition, and the rest are Wakestones and Rift Crystals which can be acquired in-game easily. There's an item to mark Wakestone shards on your map, and they respawn. RC is common, and if you have a good Pawn, plentiful. As for the character re-customize DLC, that's only one to start you off. You can purchase them in-game for 500 Rift Crystals. There were only two originally until a NG+ run, but a patch is going to increase that to 99. Overall, I don't think the microtransactions matter any more than the ones in say, Resident Evil 4 Remake.",1
Positive,"I love this game. It s an improvement all around to the first one. Combat is very fun and story so far is very good. The mtx (though it shouldn t exist to begin with) misinformation is absolutely absurd. People are overreacting and blowing it wayyyyy out of proportion. If you don t take anything else away from this review, please at least read this part: YOU DO NOT NEED TO PURCHASE ANYTHING TO CUSTOMIZE YOUR CHARACTER, FAST TRAVEL OR GET RC. It is all very easily attainable as you. Please don t let the misinformation dissuade you. I LOVE that it doesn t hold your hand. I like thinking and figuring out where to go on my own. I love that the time passing actually matters in some quests. The pawn system is really cool. Combat takes a little getting used to but once you get it down it s very very fun. Performance wise, I am running a RTX 3060 with a Ryzen 7 5700x. Im playing on high settings, but if I play with the settings I m sure I could get more frames. I get 35-45ish in cities and around 50+ frames outside of cities. I m on a 240hz monitor. So the performance could definitely be better but honestly I don t notice it as much as I thought I would. I don t get any stutters or anything stupid. Probably after a few updates this won t be so bad. If that kills it for you I d wait and see what future updates bring.I m not a fan of the one save slot. I mean it s keeping me honest and I m not reloading saves for better outcomes, but I m worried I m going to screw up my save. I m not saying anything I feel that anyone else hasn t said, but I do recommend this game. If you re missing out on it because of people lying to you, just watch actual gameplay or something. It really is an amazing game that doesn t deserve the crap it s getting. Hope this helps.",1
Positive,"Tbh if its not because of the uncapped 30fps , it would ve be a very positive review game. The gameplay , the story , the combat , the world building , everything feels fine to me , i ve been playing with constant 50 fps and it doesn t bother me that much. The game itself is good , love it so much , please fix your game btw capcom.",1
Positive,Game of the Year.,1
Positive,No MTX needed to pick up hogs and throw them at people.,1
Positive,"Day one recommended if your PC is solid. Otherwise hold off and wait for some performance patches.The launch framerate issues are valid concerns, and I hope they're addressed quickly, but everyone crying about the micro transactions haven't been paying attention. While you can buy character editors and rift crystals, you can also earn them in game for free. The micro transactions in this game are very similar to the micro transactions in DMC5: not a real factor for anyone who plays the game.As for the game play itself; it's fantastic. If you liked Dragons Dogma, then you'll love this. If this is your first game in the series and you're a fan of both open world RPGS and good combat mechanics, this is for you.",1
Positive,"I run it at 4k on a top-tier AMD rig. Frame drops in the city, but otherwise a flawless game. Never needed (or knew about) the MTX until I read the negative reviews. Yes, it's stupid to have them in the first place. No, it doesn't ruin the game. If you liked the first DD, then you will like this one since it's everything the first one did but better. Just check your system requirements first, or wait for a few performance patches.Also, GOBLIN GENOCIDE. KICK A GOBLIN INTO THE BLENDER. HANG A GOBLIN FROM A WATERFALL. DIP A GOBLIN INTO THE BRINE.

Positive,"So I'm basically loving the game in it's entirety, the character creator being released before launch was a great idea, the ""no hand-holding"" rpg aspect is very old school idea and I'm all here for it! I have been non-stop playing this game since release, and actively streaming over on my Twitch channel and no matter what I'm never bored. I love the Sphinx character a lot and I love what the classes (vocations) bring to the table! I will probably never put this game down until I do everything there is to do in this game. I don't love nor hate the micro transactions for the game cause a lot of people have said ""ugh another game with micro transactions"" well all I have to say is that you can farm every single item in the game and never have to buy the micro transactions. Regardless 10/10 game, loving every second of it!",1
Positive,Wolves still travel in packs,1
Positive,innumerable amounts of high fives,1
Positive,"Games a blast but needs some optimization for sure. First game you were restricted to one character. You don't have to pay $2 dollars to just edit your character, it's for a full basic redo. You can make a good amount of tweaks simply by visiting the barber in game which costs. IN GAME CURRENCY. I don't think micro-transactions are okay but if you're gonna be upset get all your facts straight. Also running this on a 2060 Super with minimum issues. WOLVES HUNT IN PACKS ARISEN",1
Positive,"Dragon s Dogma has long been heralded as a revolutionary foray into what can be accomplished by game developers, and earned the oft-uttered title of flawed masterpiece . Widely recognised as not perfect, but an outstanding achievement that succeeded so exceptionally in particular areas that its imperfections could be taken in stride.I believe that had Dragon s Dogma 2 been the first game, it too would receive very similar praise. It would be beloved (and overlooked) by the same parties that adore or ignore the first game. However, Dragon s Dogma 2 is not this. It is the culmination of the twelve years spent awaiting the successor of Dragon s Dogma to take all that made it great, and in consideration of all that was imperfect, use this experience to craft something even greater. Something less blemished. A true masterpiece.A fair disclaimer. Whilst this review shan t involve explicit details of the story or the game, it will still give a general idea of what can be expected and as such might be treated as spoilers. It also will include particular references to the original Dragon s Dogma (though if you haven t played that, I recommend playing the original before Dragon s Dogma 2.I should aim to categorise the points covered in this review, split into the following chapters:-World (partly in comments)-Story-Mechanics (in comments due to character limit)-Music (in comments due to character limit)Each containing a few subjects. Mindful of the character limit, these will be briefer than I would like; for there is so much to be said and discussed about regarding Dragon s Dogma 2.Design and Exploration:Gransys is one of the most beloved worlds I ve ever explored in gaming, and to this day captures the ideal for me. Stunning landscapes, rewarding exploration, and traversal encouraged by each of these and a travel system that isn t too convenient or inconvenient . Dragon s Dogma 2 has set out to perfect this style, and I think that it has nearly accomplished this. I have been praising the world of this game from the start. Visually, the game is breathtaking, complemented by exceptional design and use of topography the game seamlessly blends verticality and environmental interaction to make exploration extremely thorough, wherein nearly anything you see has some manner of route to reach it. Exploration is heavily encouraged, and very rewarding whether it be through the discovery of loot, unique enemies, or even new locations or NPCs. The game doesn t do much to push you into finding things besides the simple fact of making it clear that if you try to go somewhere, you will certainly receive some reward for your efforts. It is no question that the majority of game time is invested into exploring the world.Dragon s Dogma 2 is certainly larger than its predecessor, but is densely packed with locales and dungeons/caves to explore, and is a veritable maze of paths and off-the-path routes to keep you utterly busy during exploration. It never bores or tires.That said, there are aspects that fell short. The game takes a little too long to make convenient ways of travel for the intrepid explorer. If you head off far and wide during the earlier stages of the game, returning home may be a simple use of a Ferrystone, but for lack of a Portcrystal for a significant portion of the game, you essentially lose all headway made.The rewards from exploration also grow lesser and lesser as time moves on, and a number of times I was receiving copies of things I had, and mostly weapons and armour that s purchasable at vendors not enough unique items found through thorough exploration in my opinion.It would be apt to describe Dragon s Dogma 2 as a re-imagining of the setting of Dragon s Dogma. There are alterations to the lore and story that set it apart from the original in a way that makes it clear the developers wanted to take another shot at it . Dragon s Dogma didn t have the best story, but nonetheless it was an engaging tale of hope and overcoming adversaries.Dragon s Dogma was philosophical, and yet not preachy, and drew the player into the personal engagement between the Arisen and the Dragon; culminating in their great confrontation and the terrible insight into the true nature of the world thereafter. It was flawed, but truly unique and still thoroughly engaging.Dragon s Dogma 2 divorces itself from this narrative somewhat. The story seems distracted, and sparsed out like the scattered fragments of a shattered whole. It feels incomplete, short-lived, and as though someone took a few different storyboard ideas and kind of forced them to fit together. The story is not given enough time to flesh itself out, and the characters involved are not given enough screen time to create any meaningful impact. Who your allies and enemies are seems lost as bonds and battles seem glossed over such as that one moment you think you have one enemy, and the next they are co-operating with you with no explanation as to why they are no longer enemies; or even really why they ever were in the first place.The Dragon, the heart of Dragon s Dogma, takes a back seat in this sequel. Grigori was the central character of the original, and from the very prologue was identified as the main adversary of the Arisen the very purpose of their existence, and every action thereon is to culminate in the final challenge between the pair. This story element is mentioned in the sequel, but seems utterly forgotten about by the game itself, as sadly the Dragon has almost no involvement in the story at all and seems somewhat like an afterthought.I quite liked the end of Dragon s Dogma 2, but it pales in comparison to the original, and it befuddles me that this is supposedly their true vision of the game. Dragon s Dogma just seems much better in this department.In closing, Dragon s Dogma 2 is a beautiful game. It has enamoured me, dragged me away from life and kept me trapped in its clutches and had me sunk more time into it in such a short span than is ideal or healthy. It is a good game. But it is a flawed one. I would not deign even to call it a flawed masterpiece, for while I cannot say it is worse than its predecessor, it has come twelve years thence, and it feels to me to be an imitation that seems lesser. It cannot capture the original s accomplishment unless it is outstanding in its own right, much like how breaking a record is ever more impressive than meeting an existing one despite that the achievement is equal.I only hope there is more to be given in the future.",1
Positive,"Fix the game*EDIT:Ok they kinda fixed it, still has many issues but nothing severe, I just expected more from the main storyline though, i felt like it was just poor written and extremely slow.I know it is my fault, I've been told that this is the type of game where you just wanna explore as much as you can, I kinda just speedran all the main quests and I finished the game in like 3 days, so yeah, take your time guys.Pawns are pretty dumb sometimes and for some fk-ng reason they always jump down cliffs on every chance they get which is pretty curious to me.The character customization is the best I've ever seen so far, I remember seeing some mfer sharing his Arisen looking like Gollum from the lord of the rings .Many people complain about having to pay money to edit your character, this is an issue I bypassed very easily and quickly with mods, but I still find it very unfair towards people who, for example, play on consoles.The game is good, price is kinda high, I do don't think they should lower the price, instead I think they need to improve the game and make it worth it bcause it does have a lot of potential.",1
Positive,"Dragon's Dogma II is a technical mess to the point of fascination. It makes itself, steam, and even my entire computer crash and freeze in deeply interesting fashions that remind me of mid 00s Source Jank.Thankfully, it is also one of the best video games I've ever played. Look, should you buy Dragons Dogma II right now? Probably not. It crashes like crazy and has all sorts of optimization issues that need ironing out to make it have reasonable performance on the recommend system requirements. However, I don't think that should take away from the fact that this is a very special game and deserves your time when a few patches are out and the stability has improved.",1
Positive,"I was having issues at first but after some settings adjustments, it runs fine now.I capped my frame rate and turned off all the unnecessary graphics bloat.A crash here and there but the game does a decent job of auto-saving.Most of the stuff you can buy for real money can be earned in game.Nothing you can only buy for real money actually matters.One save file is lame.Combat is solid (playing as a fighter, I can't speak on the other vocations).Story is interesting enough so far to keep me hooked.If you like arpg's, you will probably like this one.A lot of the criticism I see is valid, the constructive stuff at least, But try to remember when you are looking at reviews that people have been planning on dumping on this game for being ""woke"" for a while now.Pay attention to the review itself and decide if it sounds like someone who wants to play the game and can't or it sounds like someone who wants to hate the game no matter what.",1
Positive,"Solid, fun game, having tons of fun.",1
Positive,"Microtransactions shouldn't even exist for items that CAN be obtained in-game for free. The game itself is good, but the fact something like that existed seems to caused the game to have unfair reviews.",1
Positive,"not without its flaws, but a very enjoyable experience regardless. if you liked the first game chances are you'll have fun with this one.",1
Positive,"This game is so much fun, the combat and pawn system are pretty awesome. I often spend hours just exploring the world and the caves. I really enjoy the ""Trickster, Mystic Archer and the Mystic Spear-hand"" vocations. The world is full of enemies and I'm just having a really good time with the game. I definitely recommend this game to anyone who is like rpg games.",1
Positive,"Finished my first cycle of the game in around 115 hours and all I can say is this is amazing, literally everything I ever wanted from a new title in the series, now please add in Bitterblack Isle as well as some Everfall like dungeon with randomized content and this will become the best RPG ever.",1
Positive,"Its crazy how many negative reviews only launched the game just to tell everyone that microtransactions are bad. I agree with most of the reviews, but the game outside of the issues described has been amazing so far. I wanted to wait until later to really sink my teeth into the world and its mechanics but doing the review now instead to say the game is fun despite the issues.The optimization is pretty bad. My PC has more than the recommended specs, and I've tweaked with the settings quite a bit to no success; sometimes I'll get the full 60 FPS even when in combat, other times it dips very low, maybe around 20-30 FPS when there are a lot of spells or effects going off or walking in an area with lots of trees. I am optimistic they can patch the game to run more smoothly, and even with performance dips, I've still had a lot of fun with combat and exploration.The microtransactions are shitty and completely unnecessary from what I've seen in game. Other than the Harpy Lure or the Soundtrack (only DLC on the steam page that makes sense,) I have found every other item by traveling with other pawns, looting it, or it is purchasable in game with in-game currency. You can change your appearance once you get to the Capital for 500 RC, which I have enough RC and have made it to the capital under 6 hrs. You can definitely get there faster and I'm not certain how to farm RC but if I've gotten enough with random wandering, I'm sure everyone else can too. The complaints about these MTX are really over the top and I wanted to let others know that you don't need to pay real money for this stuff. Again, it is very silly its even there but they aren't paywalling features, just giving quick access to people who want to spend.As for the actual video game its been very satisfying so far and as someone who's never played DD1, it has been a blast to learn about all the mechanics of combat and exploration. I am also pleasantly surprised with the pawn's performances. I thought they would be poor at fighting but for the most part they help cover the gaps in what your own vocation lacks. Maybe later into the game they will fall off but as for the beginning of the game up to where I am, my main pawn as a thief has been very good at combat and they'll help gather random items while exploring or point out interesting objects like ladders or treasure chests.I could say more about the good in the game but I'll leave it off as a general recommendation. If you enjoy Action RPG combat, exploration and creating your own character to experience the world, I believe you'll really enjoy Dragon's Dogma 2. Don't let the MTX scare you off.",1
Positive,"As a huge fan of the first game, I was really looking forward to Dragon s Dogma 2. For 10 years, fans of DD1 couldn t even be sure about a sequel ever being made, and here we are now. Just to stress even further how much of a fan I am: I preordered this game. I have never preordered any other game before. Dragon s Dogma 2 is a fantasy RPG game with the base plot of you being the Arisen who is bound to be the one to slay the Dragon. A special feature of Dragon s Dogma 1 was the Pawns who travel along with you and aid you in all kinds of ways. In Dragon s Dogma 2, this feature returns and was further improved upon (at least for the most part; I miss some of the old iconic voice lines, for example). The gameplay is probably the highlight of this release. You can choose from multiple different vocations, falling into the types of physical fighters, archers, and magic-using classes. The combat is extremely satisfying and smooth, no matter if you fight groups of small enemies or big enemies. Every enemy has weak spots, and in case you are wondering how to make use of a cyclops weakness on the eye as a fighter with a sword: you can climb on enemies and hit them where it hurts. The combat leaves you a lot of freedom by, for example, letting you throw enemies to the ground or apply certain status effects they are weak against, etc. You can be creative here or just beat them to death if you wish to, I guess In order to fight these enemies, you will have to travel the world. This time around, the map is much bigger than in the first game; however, the parts you can actually travel through are not even that big. It s mostly linear paths you follow and not a huge open field you might know from games like Elder Scrolls. The map itself is split into two regions: Vernworth and Batthal. While Vernworth has forests and hills with an overall green setting, Batthal is basically one big canyon. Technically, there is also a third area with the volcanic islands next to Batthal. In my opinion, this suffices for enough variation when traveling. I personally don t mind not having that many huge open fields, but a few more ways to travel to a certain place would have been better. Fast travel exists in the form of portcrystals and ferrystones, just like in the first game. You need to acquire a portcrystal first, place it somewhere (so you will have to travel to that spot normally first), and then you can use a ferrystone to teleport there. Because of this, you will end up manually traveling a lot and using the same roads with the same enemies over and over again. This time around, there are also oxcarts to fast travel from one city to another, but those might get ambushed, causing your fast travel to stop and put you into a fight.The story is pretty bad. Can t say much more about that. The first game already had a gimmicky story which you had to read more into or search for more lore. This game s story feels extremely unfinished and has a sudden jump once you change the region. The end also comes very suddenly. Doing certain side missions helps with learning more about the world, but it feels weird nonetheless. The graphics are really good and very much fitting current standards. For fans of the first game, the graphics are basically a dream come true. However, many people have reported performance issues, which apparently got better over time. The issues are apparently linked to the NPCs and cause your CPU to be the bottleneck. In my setup with an AMD 7700x and an RTX 4070ti, I didn t really have any problems but also didn t reach more than 100fps usually. Cities with many NPCs are especially bad.I love Dragon s Dogma and I love Dragon s Dogma 2 at least as much as the first game. The first game was saved by the DLC in many aspects. Might happen here too, who knows. I liked the base game enough to recommend it, but I guess I would consider myself a hardcore DD1 fan. I own it on every platform it was ever released on and gifted it to more people than I remember.",1
Positive,So far: -Great gameplay-Good story-Amazing boss fights-Good class diversity-Shit performance-MTX-Loss of character control is cringeAt the moment 8/10,1
Positive,My pawns thinks a ladder is an adventure.,1
Positive,"I'm in love with this game. The exploration is amazing - first time around, it took me forever to get through even the first few main quests, because ""oh look! What's over there?""The class fantasy is amazing, but don't expect too deep of a story. This game'S strength definitely lies in combat and exploration.Climbing big monsters to hit their weak points never gets old, and killing a boss always satisfying.After a certain level, the challenge turns into a power fantasy - especailly if you play New Game+But you also have the option to start over fresh, if you prefer to experience the challenge again.That said, you ought to try NG+ at least once, for the few additional features it brings (better armor, vocations buffs etc).Ignore the micro transactions, you legit do not need any of them. It feels like Capcom forced the devs to add *something*, so they did. But the game is defo not designed around them.Travelling is slow, yes - but it has been in the first game as well. This is a design choice of the game, and honestly one of it's strengths, since it pushes you towards exploring this beautiful handcrafted world.Just too bad the built-in photo mode is a bit limited. But hey, better than nothing!This is not like Elden Ring, even though many mention these games together. The combat is different. You need to compose your adventuring party wisely.Speaking of which, Pawns are a great addition. You can use those of other players, or play with only Capcom-made pawns. The pawn ai is both great and dumb sometimes. They have amazing moments, hilarious moments, and facepalm moments. But that is the charm of it imo. I quickly learned to love my pawn with all his quirks.Character costumization is AMAZING. I can't think of a better CC.You only have one (two-ish if you count the inn save) save files because of the pawn system. But it's fine.On PC you can easily copy the save file to somewhere else, if you really want to keep a save from some moment, but it's not really necessary. Especially since you're encouraged to play the game again with NG+, and if you so desire you can rush through the story quite quickly, if you just want to finish again.They've also patched in the option to start the game over and delete the save, if you wish.A lot of the early criticisms are overblown and invalid in my opinion - this game truly deserves better than the 'mixed' review status it has at the time of me writing this.I would really recommend to try the game, if a big explorable world full of large climbable monsters tickles your fancy.",1
Positive,"Holy Moly, what a ride this has been. A couple things to get out of the way right off the bat.1. I have been waiting for this game for just under 12 years, so i'm probably not the most unbiased reviewer, I am writing this review just after finishing my first playthrough clocking in at around 85 hours if you don't count reloads and some slight afk.2. the mtx shouldn't be in the game, period. However anyone with two brain cells to rub together should have seen this coming, this is Capcom baby, they've had paid dlc for in game items in a lot of single player(ish) games they have made in the past 12 years (RE4R, Dragon's Dogma 1, DMC5, RE8, MH:R, MH:W). At least Itsuno has the decency to make the mtx essentially useless (the game gives you wakestones out the ass, RC are useless, portcrystals are even more common than in DD:DA, you get an infinite use jail key once you get to the capital,etc)3. The performance for me was completely fine while in the wilderness, once I got into the cities my i7 7700 (I bought it 7 years ago don't be mean) was godsbaning itself and i was getting mid 20s frames. not really unplayable by my standards considering it's just walking around a city, but certainly unpleasant. Fortunately I wasn't experiencing any crashes like others have reported.With that out of the way, it's time to talk about the game itselfDragon's Dogma 2 is a game that fundamentally lives by the 'rule of cool', for those uninitiated that basically means if something is cool then it's allowed and even encouraged, regardless of how out of left field it can seem. It is a game that is just doing it's own thing, same as the first, and that was something that I and a lot of people loved about the first game, it was so utterly itself, which is still apparent in the sequel(?), from how trying to use a ferrystone in an area with a roof leaves the camera staring at your idle character and the stone lying useless on the ground for 5 seconds before letting you do anything, to when you cook something at a campfire it just cuts to real life footage of a big piece of meat being cooked, or the fact that the game doesn't actually call itself Dragon's Dogma 2 in the main title screen until you hit the endgame, that's all just weird, and I love it. It genuinely is just an improved version of the first game in almost every respect. If you played and liked the first one, you'll like the second one.now for my issues with the game, as no game is perfect. Firstly and chiefly, the game is too easy, i'm not sure if this is because I have over 1000 hours in the first game across both console and pc, but I found myself steamrolling pretty much everything except drakes within the first 10 hours (tho tbf I did start as thief which is VERY strong). Thinking back on it DD1 was also quite easy, so it's keeping with the theme but i would definitely prefer if the enemies were tuned up a little bit. Secondly, the facial animations are just, bad, like really bad, DD1 had the same issue and it certainly has not been fixed here, characters often look like they're amateur ventriloquists trying to pretend they're not moving their mouth while speaking. Another minor annoyance is the fact that you can no longer equip items from storage and instead need to withdraw the equipment from storage then go into the equipment menu, as well as storage space being reduced to 99 of a specific item, are all changes that definitely regressed from DD1, which is very odd.An additional annoyance are the changes (or more specifically nerfs) to the augment system, DD1 had a problem where a couple of augments were orders of magnitude better than anything else (looking at you Bloodlust and Autonomy), which Dark Arisen curbed slightly, by nerfing the strongest augments and capping damage bonus from augments. DD2 took this even further by further nerfing 95% of the augments, some of those were deserved, however some really were not. Let's take Athleticism, for example. in DD1 Athleticism reduced the rate of stamina consumption caused by sprinting by 50%, it was not a very common augment to use, stamina curatives were very common and there were far better augments for combat, on top of it only being obtainable relatively late game. With DD2 being a much larger map with a greater focus on exploration through the Seeker's Tokens and Golden Trove Beetles (which are fantastic), surely now is Athleticisms time to shine, and now it can reduce sprinting costs by 100%, to make it somewhat useful in combat and an amazing QoL augment, nope it's even worse now. I understand why the damage augments needed to be nerfed, they bloated stats way beyond what could easily be designed around without making it excessively hard for those not minmaxing, but there were a lot of augments that needed love and just got hit with a nerf. The end result of this being the augment meta will likely be the exact same as it was in DD1, which is a shame.I have heard people complain about the enemy variety and wish for an Everfall style endgame in the game and try to claim that DD1 had greater variety. While i can understand that the game is definitely controversial right now and people are looking for any reason to hate, you can't actually believe that DD1 had more enemy variety, theres just strictly more enemies in DD2, on top of FAR more frequent boss enemies to break up the mob packs. Similarly, I truly believe most people who say they want Everfall again have only done the Everfall for 1-2 hours, thought ""hey that's neat"" then went on to do BBI. I WAS THERE, 12 YEARS AGO, IN THE EVERFALL! It was AWFUL, running around two shotting all the reskinned enemies and taking 3 damage on the off chance you get hit, clearing rooms in 30 seconds then spending 90 minutes godsbaning yourself until you get the 1% drop rate item you wanted from this one specific chest. No thank you, I will not do that again, no matter how cool you make your nebula cape, the post game in DD2 (without spoilers) is extremely cool and shakes up the game in a unique way, and a lot of effort clearly went into it considering most people will probably rush through it in like 2 hours.In DD1 the first 90% of the story was awful, and then things picked up in the last 10%. In DD2, the first 80% of the story is mediocre but nothing special, and the last 20% is actually pretty good, which is a marked improvement, maybe by DD6 Itsuno will have figured out how to make things captivating from the beginning. It then follows, if you're someone who really needs a meaty interesting story from the get go to enjoy a game, this isn't for you, this game puts it's gameplay so far first the story is remembered about 70 hours in (if you're an avid explorer like me).And speaking of the gameplay, woah Nelly, it is fun. I do not think I have had more fun actually playing a game in my entire life, the abilities are so meaty and brutal, the animations are stylish, the particle effects are flashy, the music is fantastic, the feeling of teleporting onto a monsters back with a plunge attack and knocking it over as the music swells is euphoric, the bliss that runs through your veins as you swing a gigantic two handed mace around, sending great beasts staggering with each blow, letting out the most satisfying CRACKs and roars of pain, the awe you experience when you line up a perfectly charged shot with your bow right into a cyclops' eye, sending it reeling, the power at your fingertips when you summon a tornado to wreak havoc in the enemy ranks, those moments are nigh indescribable and some of the most fun that can be had in gaming. Dragon's Dogma 2 LIVES by the rule of cool, and by god does it deliver.In Conclusion: Dragon's Dogma 2 is a really, really fun game, whose story will probably lose you before it becomes interesting, and is extremely weird, and I love it.",1
Positive,"Good game.- Performance: The frame drop is insane when you enter big cities or places swarmed with NPCs, otherwise the FPS is quite stable. My specs: RTX 3060 12gb, i7-12700k, 64gb ddr4. I play with graphics on high, 1080p, with an average 60-70fps. In the cities 40-55fps.- Gameplay: Pretty much as good as the first game, the combat flows quite well, different vocations are not balanced but I don't see it as a problem since it's a single player game.- Story: Nothing special. If you're looking for a game full of remarkable characters and a mindblowing plot, this is not it. There are a lot of side quests and stories but you will probably forget all of them a week after playing.- Microtransactions: I see many people complaining about them, personally I don't think it's a problem since all of the items can be obtainable in game. The only unique one is the camping kit, and it's only because it doesn't break. The ""fast travel"" items are nearly useless since you need another item only obtainable in game to use it, and they are quite rare and expensive. The crystal only gives you another location to teleport to, and it doesn't affect the story.- Denuvo: Unfortunately, we need to cope with it. There's nothing we can do.To sum it up: It's fun if you like grinding. No big story or anything. Overall, I give it a 8.5/10",1
Positive,"Dragons Dogma 2. The long await sequel to Dragons Dogma. Fans of the original have been waiting twelve years for this game. Was it worth the wait?This is going to be less of a ""review"", like ""graphics gud, not enough water"" and more of a response to the most common complaints I've seen on reddit, on steam, and in the other reviews here, so let's get started!Point Number 1: Microtransactions. ""Oh no, DD2 has microtransactions oh my god its the end of the world!"" Monster Hunter World/Rise has MTX. Street Fighter 6 has MTX. RE4, 5, 6 7, 8 have MTX. DD1 had MTX. DEVIL MAY CRY 5 HAS MTX. It's not a big deal. You can only buy riftcrystals (which you get ingame), a single portcrystal (which you can get multiple of ingame), a camping set (which you can get ingame), a way to recustomize your character/pawn (which you can get ingame). There are zero. ZERO, microtransactions shoved in your face in the game, in the main menus, in any part of the game. The only place you'll see MTX is in the DLC tab on the steam store page. All of these are worthless and you don't need to buy anything, they're only around for the lazy and the uninformed.Point number 2: Performance. The game is VERY CPU intensive. Everyone talking about the performance is 100% correct. Your 4090ti gpu means nothing if your CPU isn't also from at least 2020-2021, so if you've been doing well so far with a CPU from 1990, or 2000, you're going to need to upgrade. With an nvidia RTX 3070 and a AMD Ryzen 7 5800 8-core processor, I'm able to get buttery smooth performance out in the wilderness away from NPCs. Once I get into towns or areas with a lot of NPCs, that performance gets down to like 30FPSish. Your mileage may vary with this.Point number 3: No New Game option and only one save slot. This is also an issue people are 100% correct on. Capcom is planning on adding a new game option, but it's unacceptable that a game released in 2024 doesn't have a way to start a brand new game. DD1 and DD2 only allowed you to have a single save file, and you have to go into your data files to grab your saves to back them up if you want to start new without losing an old character. In DD1 it wasn't a huge deal because it had the option to start a new game, whereas in DD2, with no new game option, you have to go into your save files and manually delete them to start fresh.Point number 4: Lack of enemy variety in the open world. Oh boy, where do I start with this one? People seem to be complaining that DD2 lacks enemy variety. Did you know DD1 also has a lack of enemy variety? In DD1 you get bandits, goblins, harpies, cyclops, chimera, trolls, one or two hydra in very specific places. There's one griffon that shows up later, and is used as a setpiece. There's one cockatrice that shows up later as a setpiece, or can be found in a hidden cave.What do we have in DD2? Bandits, goblins, harpies, cyclops, minotaurs, griffons (more than one!), drakes (more than one! (pre-postgame in DD1) ), trolls, chimera. There's one medusa/gorgon you can find in a very specific place, no hydras, and a special encounter with a sphinx. As far as enemy variety goes, they're quite similar.Point number 5: Open world is lifeless and uninteresting. At this point I don't think anyone who uses this as a criticism of the game has played DD1 or DD2 and are just bandwagoning. DD2's world is 1000 times more alive and interesting than DD1's lifeless and dull world.TL;DR: Performance issues, CPU intensive game, your graphics card hardly matters. Microtransactions that are easily ignorable and have literally zero impact on the game or your enjoyment AT ALL. Check your CPU before you buy this. If you're the type of person that sees Denuvo and automatically ignores a game then you probably won't buy this game, or any capcom game for that matter.",1
Positive,"Last 47 hours has been fantastic, game is just as expected with much more. It s as awesome as Dragons Dogma, but more. I don t want to spoil anything but it s worth every penny. A lot of people are complaining about playability, I don t understand how these quote on quote beast machines with 4090s are having all this trouble running it. I have a Radeon saphire pulse 5600xt, and a ryzen 7 2700 cpu, which everyone tells me I badly need to upgrade. Plays just fine on default settings, and looks amazing. Very much recommend, best single player RPG I have played in a while.",1
Positive,"This is an outstanding game that should be a GOTY nominee. Again, The Perfects (basement dwelling gamers) have outperformed themselves in being retarded.The backlash this game has is the most unfair shit I've seen from any game in my llfe. A constant flurry of twisted and malicious misinformation depicting exactly the 'modern audience'. This is why we don't deserve nice things.You can't reason a person outside of an argument they didn't reason themselves in.In the words of the honorable Colonel Campbell, all these people lack the qualifications to exercise freewill.",1
Positive,"Dragon's dogma 2 has microtransactions. ""hits head with club and screams like a donkey""RE4 has The same microtransactions. ""GOTY BEST GAME EVER THIS GAME SHOULD HAVE MY BLOODLINE WOJACK FACE"" in all seriousness the only problem in this game is the bad performance if they fix that this would be a masterpiece of a game.",1
Positive,"That is.Once you're past the tutorial.Once you've already visited the main city.Once you've gotten used to the adventuring loop and figured some basic stuff out.And it. is. GRAND!You take a party, you go out, scale cliffs. Discover canyons. Mountaintops. Caves.This is DDDA, but on a completely larger scale. It's not 90% plains anymore; you will scale rocky mountains, cross stone bridges and find ruins and old towers and battle your way to where ever your path leads you.If you're coming from DDDA (like I am), the new combat system (mainly button mapping) will take some getting used to, but not too much. Once you get used to it, it's just as engaging (if not moreso) as DDDA!Now, unfortunately, there ARE issues with performance, and you will encounter those largely in cities. The flak Capcom is getting right now concerning performance is warranted. High-end machines shouldn't be stuttering or experiencing 30-40's drops in a 2024 game. Optimization is awful, and they absolutely need to address it.There not being a ""new game"" option is also questionable, since it was present in DDDA. No clue why you'd REMOVE a basic function that was present in the first game, and should be common practice in any game after 1980.That being said, everyone needs to ignore the stupid microtransaction debacle. Those were present in MHW, RE4, DMC5; and just like those games, everything being sold as MTXs are obtainable IN-GAME. It's a non-issue being blown up because of the performance issues. Classic South Park ""rabble rabble rabble"" syndrome.All in all, 26 hours later and I'm having a blast!Now, I'm off to find that g*dd*mn ladder my pawn won't shut up about!",1
Positive,"this game is a more evolved version of the first game, i can just ignore MTX, for the every item in the game can be bought / acquire easily.just F*CK denuvo man, it sucks!",1
Positive,"I truly fell in love with this game. I run a 3090 with decent other specs. It looks gorgeous. Sure there is some drop of frames in the town as of now but it doesn't effect my game-play or fun being 12 hours in. Mostly Negatives are cry babies who don't have more than character creation and burned town under their belt. Any Mtx in the game is literally something you can find or buy in game. All game currencies are earned IN GAME, you dont need to supplement from anywhere else. Its such a hilarious and fun adventure. a Looters PARADISE lol. This game is built around the idea of travel being fun and exploring every nook and cranny worth it. The pawns make my life brighter and hilariously frustrating. In love with all the voicelines and banter had with the pawns. They even tell you when you are doing better than their master its great. 9/10 for sure. then 10/10 after bug fixes and tweaked optimization.",1
Positive,"I have spent the majority of the 2 days since release playing this game and have loved every second of it.About the issues that the horde are complaining about. The microtransactions are a little odd but nothing that hasn't been done before, some single-player jrpgs games I have seen have way worse fast progression dlc. Not defending the practice, but In my opinion the outcry is a huge overreaction especially as there is no need to even look at them if you are not in a rush and play the game at your own pace.The performance. I have a 2060 super and an i7 - 9700 and play with max resolution and mixed other settings and it runs really well bar some stutters at the point of loading into cities or big areas. But im no PC expert and every PC is different even with the same components so if you have any doubts you may want to wait until some updates.The game itself is incredible. The combat from the first one is there with some improvements to make it feel even better. the world is really cool to explore and run around in, in addition to looking absolutely beautiful. I haven't actually played much of the story beyond reaching the city as I have just been wandering around fighting monsters and doing sidequests but what I have played is interesting and a step up from the slightly awkward storytelling of the first.In conclusion if you liked the first one you will love this one. I recommend at least trying it out to see if you are negatively affected by the issues. But if you haven't played the first one It may be safer to get that first to see if you like it until this one is more reliably stable for all, as that is still a masterwork and cant go wrong with it.",1
Positive,stop crying about mtx that you're not forced to pay for and can get yourself by playing the game. game is good so far but needs to be optimized for mid-low end pc's. recommend waiting for game to be fixed but other than that its one for the books.,1
Positive,"While the optimization issues may be bad and the game definitely needed to be in the oven for a bit longer (plus L micro transactions), despite all those issues (which i hope are fixed) I still genuinely enjoy the game and combat, Ive been playing Warrior and love how weighty the great sword is, and the enemies are fun to fight",1
Positive,"See those precious 23 hours of playtime right there ? Yeah those 23 hours of my life are gone now because i decided to load the game at the last INN i slept at which was 10 minutes into the game :)The Review is positive for now cause im still fighting my inner self about the question if ill start over or just quit.So the moral of the Story is:NEVER PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD NEVER CLICK THAT GODDAMN BUTTON WHICH SAYS ""LOAD FROM LAST INN REST""Hope i can save someones day with this Review.",1
Positive,"Great game. Love Dragons Dogma 1, this is more of the same. The world looks fantastic and is genuinely nice to explore. Quests, while standard fantasy fare, are fairly good. Combat is engaging and fluid once you get the hang of it. There are genuine criticisms about microtransactions, but as many have said, you don't need to buy any of them to play and enjoy the game. There is a minor issue with performance in city areas, but nowhere near enough to make me want to stop playing. Developers have acknowledged this and are looking into a fix. Very happy I bought this. Great Game!",1
Positive,"Denuvo sucks but what can you do. DLC is non-essential and can all be earned in-game. Biggest problem is poor optimization. Even on high-end PCs, FPS drops below 30 in busy areas. Game's engaging, but tech issues hurt. I'm hopeful for patches down the road, but Japanese studios typically don't have a good post-release pipeline. The game itself (barring all the above) is good and exactly what I'd been hoping for in a sequel.",1
Positive,a pawn told me her master is a furry and only hires women.,1
Positive,"This game has faced a lot of unfair criticism ever since its launch, my entire playthrough ive had nothing but an enjoyable experience, the micro transactions don't matter because all the stuff you can buy is extremely easily obtainable. The only valid criticism is that the performance could be better but it doesn't stop Dragons Dogma 2 from being a enjoyable experience, from the vocation variety and large list or skills you can unlock. there's always a new way to play or something to spice up your current play style. 9/10 would recommend",1
Positive,"First with the bad -1. The Performance in Towns sucks hope it gets fixed, Ryzen 9 3900x + 4070Super around 30 to 45 fps2. The gotta remove those horrible ""DLC"", its shi*ty practice and shouldnt be buyable specially since its all in-game free!3. No ""start new game"" I mean it doesnt bother me but hope they add it soon in upcoming patches, hopefully there is hardmode and speedrun mode after finishing 1st playthrough.Now the best bits -1. Graphics are insanely good2. Combat is a nicely improved from DD1 but doesn't stray from it3. Enjoying the storyline and worldbuilding4. Addition of Beastrens is awesomeI'm looking forward to finishing it and playing through multiple times for 100% achievements :)",1
Positive,"I recommend this game entirely.TL;DR: Gameplay, world, customization = fantastic, 9/10.Current issues: PerformanceThe flow of combat, the customization of your character and just the general feel and sound of everything really feels amazing. The whole ""David vs Goliath"" thing on where you vs much bigger monsters than yourself, just feels awesome to actually combat and strategize on hitting weak spots.The ""micro-transactions"" aren't really an issue at all. It's more like a payable ""boost"" to help you get started. You literally don't have to pay for anything in that DLC list as you can farm/earn all of it within the game. An issue I find as of now, is performance. Denuvo is horrible at killing performance for everyone and anyone, doesn't matter on PC specs at all. But, I'm comfortable sitting at 40-50 FPS in towns/crowded areas and a nice 80+ everywhere else. One other thing I wish for, is being able to turn down the frequency of your Pawns speaking. It's not needed for a heap of chatter to happen, some of it is actually very useful, but other times it's very unneeded and is just really weird. I've have some Pawns tell me about a ""boulder we can push"" to then show me a rock across the entire map in an area I haven't been in yet.",1
Positive,"Okay yes, it's a rough launch, but I didn't let that stop me. Although; I may be a bit biased, since I have been waiting forever for DD2 to come out. Only about 13-ish years. Anyway, yeah, the performance is not up to standard right now, but I'm sticking with the game regardless atm. I'm sure Capcom will will find a way to optimize the game more and more. If you played the first game before (yes, I understand it's really and old rough, but give it a chance if you can), you'll feel right at home. I've seen some people say the movements and combat is kinda clunky. Well, it was the same way in the first, and it nails that feeling of staying true.",1
Positive,"I've noticed that 90% of the negative reviewers have less than 4 hours playing. Coincidence? I think not.tbh the game runs without an issue, I've been having a blast literally nonstop since the moment it came out and I installed it, and the ""microtransactions"" everyone is whining about, while I agree its dumb, are also entirely pointless as you get all that in game playing in like, 6 hours at most.If you loved Dragons Dogma Dark Arisen, you will love Dragons Dogma 2.I can't positive this review enough.",1
Positive,"I don't ever write reviews but I think someone needs to back this game up because people are whiners. Yes there is cheap little garbage micro transactions but there is zero reason they should even be used as RC is obtained with EASE during game play. Said RC is then used to change your CHARACTER so who cares that you spend some time in game to obtain the amount needed. Yes micro transactions are a plague but if you have zero reason to use them then why cry about it?As for performance I don't know what people expect but I run this on a Legion gaming laptop at 60-70 fps consistently except in the main city where it drops somewhat significantly. My graphics are set to a custom mix of medium and low and I honestly think the game still looks amazing. The combat is phenomenal in my opinion and just an improvement to the first game along with the exploration and sights being exciting to look at. Most people bashing this game probably have barely experienced what it has to offer and bash it instead of giving it a chance. In short, people are whiners and cannot tolerate anything anymore UUHH game good I like much. Thank you for reading",1
Positive,"CAPCOM is one of the most mixed bag companies ever.On one hand they publish and produce some of the highest quality games (aside from EXOPRIMAL). For the past 5 years they've been doing this with stuff like Devil May Cry 5, Resident Evil 2, Street Fighter 6 etc.Then on the other hand, they put the most baffling microtransactions in their singleplayer games for absolutely no reason whatsoever. Dragons Dogma 2 is no different. Honestly, this game is the greatest offender so far and it's probably gonna just get worse from here. But the game is hype as shit so I can't give it a negative review lol",1
Positive,"They're masterworks all, you can't go wrong all the way can it?. Btw ROOK IS WITH US, LETS GOOOO Microtransaction For those who mentioned about the micro-transaction issue, Art of Metamorphosis is a one time change for the appearance of your character. There will probably be a Secret of Metamorphosis that you can exchange by using Rift Crystal which is also offered as a micro-transaction, but you can earn Rift Crystals by having people rent your pawn. The only micro-transaction that can't be earned in-game is the original soundtrack. Performance issues It happened for MHW, the lack of optimization and very bad launch but the devs eventually fixed it and it became one of their best selling game and beloved by the community. Tbh, DDDA also had their issues with the network and etc when its released in Steam. Hence, I'm sure that Capcom will take into account of this situation and give us an explanation and solution to the problems. Denuvo and etc Well, I can't vouch for them regarding this. Yeah prevent piracy and all that, but it's bad.Anyways, for the vets we have been waiting for so long, in time it will be all better. For people who never tried DDDA and got this but face many issues, have faith in Capcom. They are an amazing developer and they will fix it!",1
Positive,"Go get some new hardware and the game will run fine.It s fun, too. Like the first one, but bigger, more complex and overall better.Finally another game that doesn t take one by the hand but encourages us to make mistakes and learn from them.I am in love!",1
Positive,"game is excellent, run well except in the city they need to fix that. They need to get rid of the shop its embarrassing.",1
Positive,"Fun game, terrible optimization get it on discount.",1
Positive,"I found this game more fun than Elden Ring. The fighting mechanics are great, the pawn system makes you forget that the game is single player. Traveling at night is very dangerous and the graphics are beautiful. I think I don't need to talk about the character creation part. I see the future of the game as bright, but Capcom has to solve the optimization problem.",1
Positive,"Dragon's Dogma 2 feels like a truly triumphant game with some terrible, though few, flaws. This has turned into one of my favorite RPGs of the last several years, but that's not to overhype the game beyond its drawbacks.First, the flaws.MTX: Addressing the elephant in the day-one room, the MTX shop is definitely there but isn't at all like everyone seemed to be complaining about. It's a totally reasonable assumption to see things in the MTX shop like revive items, fast travel stones, and character appearance changes and think, ""Oh, so they just removed those from the game and locked them behind a paywall. Absolute trash."" I would vehemently agree if that were the case, but it ain't. All of that is in the game and, while uncommon, isn't exactly hard to acquire. [Minor spoiler] I've even gotten an item pretty early as a quest reward that literally shows rez stone parts on the map permanently, as well as found several fast travel stones and at least one character appearance change item (all three of these are also available in several stores throughout the game for the game's regular in-game currency, though they're a bit costly). I legit have no idea why the MTX shop exists, because it's nothing that anyone would actually need or want to buy; it's just completely normal in-game stuff that you will naturally acquire by just.playing in a completely normal way.Inventory, and pawns: A minor but constant annoyance is inventory management; you've gotta shuffle your inventory around between your party aaaaaaall the time due to the encumbrance system, with your main character picking up 95% of the loot and easily getting encumbered, and that requires manually moving each item individually to your three pawns. That then complicates another mechanic, which is that your drafted pawns can permanently die just from walking too close to a cliff edge or literally any body of water deeper than two feet, taking with them all the loot you essentially *had to* put on them. You can craft (""combine"") items in inventories, but only one at a time, so all that stuff you've been dividing among your pawns isn't shared in crafting (as far as I've seen, but I could be mistaken).Saves: The biggest flaw, imo, is the way the game saves. You can lose hours, perhaps dozens of hours, of playtime by misclicking. It seems that save files are cloud-based (though there's an offline workaround, I guess), with only two save slots that are divided based on how you're saving - rest at an inn to get one save, and then literally all other saving goes on the other file. If you accidentally click on the ""load from last inn rest,"" it can immediately save in the *other* save file the moment you load back into the world; if you last rested at an inn many hours ago, you've now just lost all that playtime since both saves are now essentially at the same old spot. That's an awful, awful design.NOW THE GOOD STUFF! Everything is voice acted, and most of it's great. The pawns constantly talking can sometimes be annoying, but they actually say super useful stuff about enemy weaknesses or nearby secret spots or reminders about local quests (plus, they can even give directions for how to get to them!), overall being a great thing.The world feels well-populated and interesting. Quests acquisition often feels organic, where you're rewarded for exploration and curiosity rather than walking into town and seeing thirty (!) markers over NPC heads to indicate they're a quest-giver; if you see someone in a troubling situation, or behaving slightly differently from the crowd, talking to them can result in a mission. And it's so far been pretty interesting to engage in the quests! Many of them feel moderately unique, though you'll definitely find the occasional fetch quest. And the story has got its hooks in me waaaaaay more than most of the predictable RPG tropes (though more is yet to be seen).The pawn system is great (aside from the aforementioned issues), and I've legit felt compelled to really beef up my pawn so all the folks who are calling her up can get real value.Combat feels GREAT and I've found tons of random interactions that blew my mind with their weirdness/uniqueness, plus so many ways to actually engage the enemies in curious ways. Having multiple pawns (plus yourself) climbing up the legs of a massive giant like ants swarming a beast is a sight to behold, then shanking it repeatedly in the back while it tries to throw you off just feels boss. Or casting a massive, spiky ice wall that leaves behind a platform you can leap off of, which later deteriorates to ice blocks you can pick up and toss at enemies - that's just ONE spell providing a range of opportunities.Overall, my hour-by-hour experience is really fantastic and has started to feel epic, though it's still minorly bogged down by those little annoyances and the terror of destroying my saves on accident. I am enthralled by the best parts of Dragon's Dogma II and I don't want it to let me go any time soon.",1
Positive,"Dragon's Dogma 2 is a fantastic game with some minor flaws that should have been tweaked for a smoother experience, and enjoyment of the game.Gameplay: The combat is fantastic. They have done a great job keeping the oomph that you felt when you played the first game. Spells look incredible, and do a great job at painting a powerful picture of your protagonist. The enemy variety was not great. There are several times where you would get ambushed by the same repeating enemy over and over and over again. While that was not something you would notice in the first game, it is more distinguishable in the second because the size of the game has increased. Lastly, there should have been more ways to travel around the environment. There are a few different methods of traveling about, but they require you to go out your way to utilize their functionality.Graphics: The graphics were great! There were several times in which I was in awe at looking at some of the environments. They've done a fantastic job at ensuring that the game looks spectacular. Visiting different towns, and areas was great. Seeing how the culture, people, and the vibe change was a treat for my brain.Sound: It's great! Had a lot of some bangers in this sound track that you could listen to outside of the game. No complains here, you'll definitely want to listen to it while playing as it is done well. There are quiet moments in the game as well, and the sound design enhances all parts of the experience.Story: It was pretty good. While this is not one of those stories that will keep you thinking after you've completed the ending. It was worthwhile paying attention to due to the way it was presented. The political side of it was interesting as there were some twists that were not expected. I don't think they did a great job at highlighting each major characters. It felt as though they introduced a major character, and then just pushed them aside while focusing on something else. Then the major character becomes relevant again, but again, nothing is done with them. A lot of potential there that was squandered.For a sequel to Dragon's Dogma 1, this game did a fantastic job at becoming a sequel to the story. Some aspects of it is certainly improved upon while others it did not change enough for it to be an improvement. It is most definitely worth playing through the game as it still a fun experience despite its flaws. I highly recommend this game to anyone looking for an action role-playing game. It has its flaws for sure, but it is one of those type of games which you won't play again until Dragon's Dogma 3 releases.",1
Positive,"Only ~4 hours in so far but: Combat is incredibly fun, exploring scratches all the right itches. Performance is great when outside of the main city - 80+ fps at 1440p with everything cranked, RT on and DLSS on Quality. Performance in the main city - lowest I've seen is 47fps, which so far, yeah not great but not too bothered. All this on: RTX 40705800X3D I've had to go out of my way to find the microtransactions, do I wish they were in the game? Absolutely not. Does that impact the fact that the gameplay itself is actually fun? No it does not. Overall, rabble rabble, fun game.",1
Positive,"Good game so far. Not experiencing any bugs or performance issues personally. The dlc nonsense is avoidable, you don't need to pay to change pawn/arisen appearance, just obtain a book in game.Combat is tight, visuals look great, voice acting is stellar and the music is amazing. I recommend it, even at release.",1
Positive,"TL;DR: Game is a lot of fun, wouldn't call it a strictly improved experience over the first, but it does improve in some areas that make it friendlier to a wider audience.Dragon's Dogma II takes the typical path of a golden RPG franchise by making sequels more appealing to more people by sacrificing the depth of it's previous systems.Every aspect of the game suffers from bad conveyance somewhere and to some extent, but once you learn the specifics; sometimes quite painfully, you're golden in that aspect from then on.The game does feel incomplete. There's less fashion options that are more limited in use at the same time, skill options are cut in half to make combat feel more repetitive, and pawns have narrower options due to it all as well, but at least they added basic inherent aspects to vocations so any mage pawn you hire has Anodyne(basic heal).There is no good reason not to go Warfarer with main character, and you will not get more skills, but you will use other weapon options, making basic attacks something you will use more often, and this will make some encounters even more repetitive.The main story seems great in the first of three major areas, then it quickly makes a sprint to a pointless and not at all fleshed out ending, A couple dungeon looking destinations have no dungeon to them at all, the ""true"" ending doesn't have a proper final fight with the Dragon that the whole franchise is about, so that's a bit lackluster to say the least. if you're looking for story over gameplay look elsewhere.",1
Positive,If you're a fan of Dragon's dogma 1 then this is the game for you. Having so much fun playing that i didn't realize it's already 3pm. lolPros:-Core skills are much better now-Enemy AI are much smarter thus giving you a greater challenge-Big enough world to explore and so many optional areas that are worth exploring-Better graphics and effects of course-MTX does not hinder the games progress at all and no paywalled content.Cons:-Some may have FPS problems in the capital city (New patch might have alleviated the problem) or eastern Vermund.-No Mystic Knight. RIP-Archers/Magick archers don't have daggers anymore but being a warfarer can somewhat fix the problem-Warfarer has too few skill slots-Only 1 save file so far. This might be a problem if you get too strong later on and want to start a new game but collecting seeker's tokens again is so tedious.,1
Positive,"It's been 12 years since the first game and I'll admit I'm extremely bias in my opinion of this franchise, however the time I've put in so far with DD2 has been so extremely positive.Truly feels like a completed vision as opposed to a sequel in the best way possible. much of the niche mechanics remain and with new additions like camping it adds more immersive interactions through your playtime.Performance has been much better than what i was expecting pre-launch.My specs; RTX3070, r5 7600x, 32GB memory, playing at 1440p - I averaged around 70-90 fps in the open world, a dipped into 40-50 in populated cities. There was also the occasional slump in fps during certain combat situations but they were always short lived.The mass criticism of the inclusion of microtransactions is a misinformed mess.Every major Capcom title since the first Dragon's Dogma has included these bizarre, benign microtransactions including beloved titles like DMC5 and RE4 remake.The reality is these dlcs are utterly pointless and 99% of them are earnable in-game very easily, just as the red orbs in DMC5 were.It sucks that they exist in the first place, but I wouldn't be surprised if they've existed in all their games to appease some executive who demands it and so they instead make the dlc the most common, innocuous items you can get in-game just so they can say they have dlc.",1
Positive,"My review is very mixed, so Ill keep it plain and simple.Gameplay is great. Story is interesting and it feels like theres almost no filler. Everywhere you go is interesting and theres always something to do. Your pawns are amazing, and useful unlike most Ai allies in other games; they work very well. Performance: im not gonna beat that dead horse. Im hoping for an update to improve optimization as are the hundreds and thousands of people who bought this expensive full priced game. Microtransactions? In a single player game? Just continues to show that they really dont care. It was probably last minute as they didnt seem to exist until the game launched. No one really knew about them and boom, come release time, they just appear. We already spent $70-80. Just give us the game and let things be. None of the purchases matter. You can find just about everything in the cash shop in game anyways. Just there for some suckers to fall for the trap. couldnt be me.TLDR: Game is great! Performance bad, cant ignore that. It will get better. I hope.",1
Positive,performance is better after update.,1
Positive,"Have been waiting a long time for this game, so I am not giving up on it. I recommend waiting for the patches.",1
Positive,"This game is incredible. Ignore the DLC, it's all stuff you find in game and just enjoy an amazing open world experience. Highly recommended, a huge improvement over the first game which was already one of my favorite RPGs.",1
Positive,very good game do not buy micro transaction,1
Positive,Good game.10/10 - graphics6/10 - story (So far)3/10 - performance 60-70 most places and then 25-30 in the main city is a jokeMicrotransactions are a joke and seem to be only meant for actual room temp IQ players. If you ever get to the point where you feel that you would NEED to buy those DLCs you are bad.Stil tho Microtransactions - 0/10,1
Positive,"This game is really fun. It's like Skyrim and Monster hunter had a baby. Don't let people complaining about micro transactions get to you. You'll never need to buy anything form the store anyway. I've heard some optimization issues, but so far it's pretty smooth on my end. My recommendation is try messing around with super sampling if you cant run the game properly",1
Positive,"DON'T BUY YET. I can't exactly recommend a game that apparently is a coin toss as to whether or not it will run on your rig(even people with high end 40 series cards have unplayable issues), but I can't just thumbs it down, either, as it's been a blast. I'll just tell you my experience:The game has been a breath of fresh air. I thought I might not truly enjoy another 3rd person fantasy RPG after Elden Ring, as every game seemed to drop the ball when it came to combat. But this game? Let me just tell you.One time I was riding into a city, then a Griffin flew down and started attacking the peasants nearby. I ran up to it, jumped up and grabbed onto it's mane. It took off into the sky, I re positioned to its back. We were really high up at this point. I attacked using a greatsword, which causes you to leap the the side and swing downwards, dismounting as you do. I catch him perfectly in his head, stunning him. We fall through the air like Gandalf and the Balrog. I thought that would be it, but just as I'm about to hit the ground, my trusty sidekick catches me. We collect ourselves as the Griffin starts to get up from the ground. At this point, a few guards are here to help. We fight long and hard, then the bastard griffin just flies off right as we were about to land the final blows. I swear I heard it laughing.This is just one of many jaw dropping experiences I've had in this game, and I've only really played for about 12-15 hours or so. I have left it running for a couple of nights. This game really feels like a grand adventure. Less daunting than Elden Ring, so people who are after a severe challenge might be a bit disappointed. It's challenging in certain ways, however. It's more about prepping, and knowing when and where to rest. When you take damage, you lose a small percentage of your MAX HP, which can only be recovered by resting, so you can only heal back a portion of the damage you take. So the game's focus on real time travel makes knowing when to turn around and head back a huge part of your strategy. Risk it to get that OP item a little deeper in the neat cave you found, or turn in knowing you made decent progress?All of this means you spend a lot of time messing with your equipment, Finding it, upgrading it, doing the same for your pawns, etc. So if that seems too tedious, you might want to sit this one out, even when they fix the performance issues others are experiencing. But if you don't mind some gear planning in between epic adventures, this game is a must play. But again, don't you DARE buy this game for 70 dollars until they fix performance. BTW, I haven't seen anything about micro transactions while playing the game, and everything has been easy to obtain so far including the fast travel stones everyone is so worried about, I was worried myself that it would feel intentionally grindy in order to drive consumers towards micro transactions, but I haven't felt any of that, It's just been a pure blast, and for that I'm super relieved.P.S. I'm gonna find that griffin, I swear it.",1
Positive,Get lost in this amazing world. recommended,1
Positive,"Fantastic so far, I love all the classes and the ideas behind how you implement them.Honestly a great feeling to play a good game again. Haven't felt this way since Elden Ring release.",1
Positive,"I can sorta recommend this game, altough with caveats. Long story short: is it great? No. Is it very good? No. It's a decent game, and i had fun with it, hence the thumbs up, but it has too many flaws to make me say hell yeah. If there were an unenthusiastic thumb up icon i'd give it that. It seems amazing in the beginining, but the longer you play the worse it becomes.More in detail.- combat is fun, untill you're so OP it's a cakewalk- exploration is fun, untill you realize there is no reward for it, because you won't find anything better than you can get from vendors, and the longer you go on the mroe tedious it gets to walk and fight dozens of pointless fights that pose no challenge- classes are varied and fun, but some have such OP mechanics you have to actually nerf yourself and not use them unless you want to trivialize the game. Also compared to the first game, there is less variety and complexity, so there's that.- pawn system is good and interesting- story is garbage. It starts strong, with some cloak and dagger intrigue, but it goes nowhere and the second half of the game basically has nothing to do with it.- quests are hot garbage. There are a couple of stealth quests (main story missions) that are so pathetically bad in their execution they seem like a low quality mod. Others make you trek across the map back and forth to talk with a dude and report back, which would not be a problem if there was a free fast travel or if exploration didn't get boring after a short while- the world feels alive at the beginning, but after the initial wow factor you realize some areas have a chance to have a big monster in it, and you will find them exactly there at intervals- characters are bland, period.I know this read mostly like a negative review, but i can't deny i had my fun with the game. Worth the full price? Not if you're short on money.Final note on mtx. They suck, but are completely unnecessary. Also, if you feel like you want say a portcrystal or ferrystone, just go on nexus and download a shop mod while showing your middle finger to capcom.",1
Positive,"It's Dragon's Dogma, a new Dragon's Dogma! I'm loving it so far.",1
Positive,We live in a world that has Dragons Dogma 2.,1
Positive,The game is fantastic with an amazing game play loop. People are impatient these days and often rush to conclusions simply based on what someone tells them. The microtransactions in game are pointless and just added to make the clueless big wig investors happy and the performance issues are already being hammered out.If you want a solid rpg get this one and enjoy the ride,1
Positive,"Update: endgame is kind of bs, still love the game but beware it falls apart a bit at the end.I am playing at 1080p with a consistent 30fps. I'm old so this is fine by me. The first several hours I didn't even know there WAS micro transactions available. I missed the online shop in the main menu and there's no mention of them in game. I repeat they do not try to sell you cash shop items in the game itself. If you liked Dragon's Dogma 1 this is definitely more of the same. Looks prettier, story is a bit better, world is WAAAAY bigger, and I'm very amused by these camping spots along the road. The almost photorealistic cooking of food is silly. Pawns are still pawns which means you jump a gap and they jump down into the water and die. Happens all the time.Things I like that are new: Ox Carts. you can ride to various places for about as much money as you can grab out of a pile of broken wood on the side of the road. After 26 hours I've ridden the cart once and it wasn't attacked by anything and that just made me laugh.Having to find the arisen only vocations through quests. This is great and lead me to wander around settlements trying to talk to everyone.This game has some lovely puzzles in it. if you've got a pawn with you that has done the quest before it shows a marker in the log and you can ask them to pretty much lead you directly there.I bought a house in the city and it's already paid back it's value.And it's more Dragon's Dogma, but bigger and better.Things I do not like:We still have to mod our game for out of combat sprinting.The pawns do not shut up and I have not found any way to lower the frequency of their dialogue. that said, it's funny to see them occasionally banter with each other.The port crystal system is still a thing and wasn't something i really enjoyed in Dragon's Dogma 1.hold button to interact press button to just wave.?SINGLE SAVE FILES ARE AWFUL. Let me have two or three. The pawns all have their own IDs and who cares if you make your own pawn team with your save files. It's not like you're actually playing with other people, just their minions. It is ridiculously difficult to get pawns to give you a boost up to high places.There's no indication so far what quests may lock out other quests, which was also a problem in the first game.I can't find a healing spring and just stock up on water if I don't want to deal with combining ingredients, that said there are more ways to make non-expiring health and stamina consumables than there was before.The main city is a MAZE that I am jut now getting used to. Putting so much on top and under each other was just a weird way to do things.Several friends and acquaintances have reported some serious performance issues that are getting drowned out by whiners about microtransactions like they never played a capcom game before. At least they made them easy to ignore this time. No characters or skins locked behind them. No features.And no, capcom didn't pay me to say any of this, people can disagree with you without being paid. I think that if we ignore the micro transactions, eventually they'll be more expensive to implement than they make in profits and they'll stop. No amount of whining will get them to stop before then, all you're doing is obscuring the real problems this game has with that garbage.",1
Positive,"This is the game I always dreamed of, and it has everything I want. Basically, it's the first game but better. It gives the adventurous feeling I missed from old games. I couldn't get this feeling from BG3 (because of tadpole urgency), which is an official dnd game, DD2 feels more dnd to me. This is because the world is alive, and exploring it is so good, I believe. Map is so huge and it has different paths almost everywere. You can easily get lost and find new things as a reward. Even paths have paths inside them, and world connects itself very well. You will want to explore these on foot; i didn't use fast travel too much and enyojed the living world and random weird things happening on the roads. Once, I rode a griffin and jump midway to a mountain, spending some time to get down and follow the path, and in the end, I found a lich which was extremely fun from start to finish.I played as an archer and am currently playing as a mystic spear, and I've enjoyed them a lot. Firing an explosive arrow at the boss's eyes is so satisfying. I will try thief etc., to climb big monster more because it is so good to rapidly stab their eyes. Weight limit is kinda annoying, but you can drop every material into the inn and you can use them in shops.My only problem is it drops to 30 fps in major cities; otherwise, i am getting 60 fps with 2060(with ryzen 3600) on high. And MTXs are Capcom's fault not the game's. You dont need them in game, they are completely scams. They are not even selling tp stones just a item for opening a tp location.",1
Positive,"Actual game is amazing and has some of the best action combat i have played in a while. If you enjoyed the first game this game is highly reccomended.I have personaly been blessed with very few to no performance issues but am aware it is a big issue for people and hope it gets fixed for them.The fact you cant start a new game after starting is easily the biggest issue the game has and it should never have been missing in the first place even if its added later.I wont defend the microtransactions and am of the mind they should not exist in the first place but i am not bothered by them and can safely say they are compleatly skippable as you get plenty of what they otherwise sell ingame, including the character editor.If you are unsure, play the first game and see if you like it. Its possible to get it for very cheap when on sale nowadays.I am dissapointed that such a phenominal game is being overshadowed by alot of bad decisions around it and hope it gets better down the line.I personaly cant reccomend the actual gameplay of the game enough.",1
Positive,"microtransactions are very strange but you can totally ignore them since any of those items can be found easily, its just a noob trap. fuck capcom for pulling this on this game still.performance is bad. gameplay is very fun. long tedious walks between quests but thats the point and theres a lot to find walking around.",1

The performance can be an issue but only in highly populated areas such as the city. the gameplay is every thing I could hope for in a dd sequel and exploring the world truly is a sight to be hold. wait for the performance issues to be fixed and this game is a certain recommend if you've the money to spare, if not then wait for a sale. you do not want to miss this game just because of a poor launch",1
Positive,"Overall a good game, not great but good.Do not buy this game if you want a interesting story and well written character / quests. The main questline is extremely short and boring, just when you think it's getting interesting, it's over. Game is more like a immersive sim type of game, the exploration and trial and error stuff you can do is the meat of the game. So if you want to see the world, go anywhere you want to go, and farm up all the different jobs (vocations), you'd have an amazing time. Otherwise, not recommended for casual gamer who just want to see the story.",1

The map that there IS though is very good and no area feels empty or bland)overall 7/10 (biggest complaint is the empty map space and the fact that pawns get annoying as they will say the same things over and over and won't shut up.)EDIT: I know i only have 21 minutes on the game but i play on PS5 and have 40 hours there.",1
Positive,"Kinda fun. Runs poorly though. Still, I picked up a dude and threw him off a cliff. Only then to have my main pawn exclaim with joy that he'd learned something new. .Then watched him pick up a dude and throw him off a cliff too. Of his own volition. Ha!Would fist pump amongst cliff-throwing bros again, anytime. :D :p",1
Positive,"Me kill, me loot, me happy",1
Positive,I wait this for many years. One of the kind. Nice performance. The game gives so many hours of game play. If you play the game you do not need to buy anything so stop complaining about the shop.,1
Positive,"Hell yes, you will like the game for sure.",1
Positive,"wont comment on the micro transactions because like all capcom games they are worthless and can all be earned in game and its unsurprising by capcom. The complaint of performance is valid, the general world and its locations run mostly well and fine but its crumples in cities. However, the game that is present is rich and fun, with some of the best combat in any RPG ever. The Fellowship and through and through RPG feelings are ever present and still make for a very fun experience.",1
Positive,"despite the terrible optimization & cringey voice lines sometimes, the game is absolutely incredible. there's something just SO addicting about jumping on the game and killing monsters as a sorcerer (or whatever other vocation) along with your team of pawns. the gameplay is just So Damn Fun. i haven't continued that much in the story as i've been doing the side quests and exploring etc so i don't want to comment on the story overall, but the sidequests are fun to do as well. don't get me started on how amazing the character creation is. woah. 8/10 me thinks.",1
Positive,"Here are my experiences with the game:the bad:- Launch is really horrible, mainly because of performance issues and the steep price of $70- The mtx is just adding salt to the wound and a bad business decision that made the game launch even worse- Performance is really wonky even after the patchthe good:- DRAGON'S DOGMA IS BACK BABY, seriously if you are a fan of the first game the charm is all here, the spectacle the pawns it's there - There are multiple QoL design from the first game that address to exploration like oxcarts and camps tho I wish it was more in depth- The new vocations are cool, I personally don't like trickster but spellblade made up for it also wayfarer is sickOverall it is worth it if and only if you already like dragon's dogma. IMO the only barrier to most players is the price. Oh and if you really want to play the game but already doomposted by twitter because of microtransactions, worry not you can completely ignore it. If you have played capcom games before you know they love to use these unnecessary decisions (in dmc 5 for exmple you can buy red orbs with money).",1
Positive,"The game is great as far as combat, story, etc. But performance isn't consistent even on a high end PC, but not bad enough to ruin my enjoyment of the game. Zero bugs so far aside from some rare collision detection issues for NPCs. Only one crash so far, but I lost almost no progress because of the auto save. Micro-transactions are completely pointless in this game.",1
Positive,"Firstly, the controversies: Microtransactions - not an issue, never needed or used a single one. This is what Capcom did with RE games and no one complained to this degree. I suppose the fact they ARE totally useless is actually worse, because you are literally paying for nothing, but meh, it's a non-issue.Performance - a knottier one. If you have a 40 series card and a decent CPU this is not an issue - just download the Puredark framegen DLSS3 mod and you're away. There was one area (the aqueduct on the way out of Vernworth) where framepacing issues occur no matter what is going on, but with the mod, the main city is fine and I locked the FPS at a steady 120fps in both the city and the wilderness. For 30 series and below I can imagine it's pretty poor, as - before I used the DLSS3 mod, moving around Vernworth was making me motion sick - frame rate and pacing all over the place depending on how many NPC's are pootling around. So I wouldn't advise anyone without a 40 series card to buy yet, unless the FSR 3 mod works. Buyer beware.This game is the ""Monty Python version of Elden Ring crossed with Death Stranding"" (copyrighting that phrase), by turns infuriating and amazing. I'll admit I loved it. Planning a trip out of town to a far corner of the map, knowing you are going to have to camp out (risking camp invasion and the loss of your precious camping kit) felt like a real adventure, especially early on.Every good design decision in this game has an equal and opposite one, it's bonkers. The story is simple yet confusing; the fighting is chonky and exhilarating, whilst (for some vocations) being an imprecise mess and the graphics can be beautiful maxed out, with a luvverly RT implementation, and yet are just standard forest, desert and volcano biomes. But it has that 'something'. A charm that rises above the niggles and complaints, and is full of little moments that don't occur in the homogenous 'AAA' market that often anymore. I never stopped loving when a pawn held their hand out for a high five after a gruelling battle, or when one catches you when you fall off something in a panic. I jumped onto the Sphinx's back on a whim after it took flight and it carried me over half the map, before shaking me off at 300 feet, plunging to my death. Later sections invoke the creatures of the old Harryhausen films - the Talos-like statue of Jason and the Argonauts fighting a huge wyrm whilst all the player can do is watch from the next valley in awe; finding a Chimaera in a fog-bound valley in the rain or finding statues on the way to a cave, then stumbling across Medusa inside and legging it.Then there is the bonkers endgame, which finally uncovers the secret of the Brine and why we couldn't enter water in the first Dragon's Dogma.There was a bug in the endgame though, with a disappearing character that stopped me from evacuating one of the cities. Tried everything but no joy, bit annoying - just make sure you do Battahl first and make sure Menella survives.All in all, I just had a lot of fun basically, playing as a Magick Archer standing back and unfairly peppering huge monsters with insane attacks. Sometimes that's all you need.",1
Positive,"Feels like I am playing Dragons Dogma all over again except with a new region and a new coat of paint. That s a great feeling for me. Performance is pretty rough but playable; needs optimization patches ASAP.Really needs DRM and microtransactions removed as well Edit: Still really enjoying the game, but wish there was a Hard Mode.",1
Positive,"I've played for 13hrs and So far is a really fun game, seems like I am one of the lucky ones because I haven't got any major performance issue. Also, yes I've heard about the micro-transactions, but so far I've never felt like the items are hard to get, everything is fairly easy to obtain, so pretty much you don't need them to have the full experience of the game.",1

Positive,"So now my review. First of all, this review might piss off some people, namely the target group of gamers for whom this game is not made and who prefer to go back to their ""soft"" games. War against review bomber It pisses me off that people here are so quick to form opinions, don't have 2 brain cells to think outside the box, and let themselves be led by the masses. You are all weak in spirit and I am very happy that these people can't enjoy this game. The hype has attracted so many gaming groups, which is a good thing in the first place, but in this day and age where games are consumed rather than enjoyed, I'm not so sure. You hear everywhere that people are upset that there's a microtransaction store, even though it's been in every capcom game for the last few years and it's just an economic thing that the company does. i do not support microtransactions! Just to be clear. This fucking invention has always been complete shit and was only invented by the biggest demonic bastards. About the ""dlc"". I don't know if people have become too stupid to read or can't form their own opinion (I'm already worried enough about certain countries that this is the case anyway), but you can clearly see in the dlc store that these things are absolutely unimportant and are only intended for people who consume games and want to get to the next one as quickly as possible, who else of you monkeys would buy something for a single-player game to get ahead faster? How stupid can you be, please? (Dramatic pause for people to think about this for a moment). For anyone with a brain, it quickly becomes clear: oh, so you can buy a fast travel stone to get ahead faster. ""I don't need that"". DONE. This person wont look a second time in the dlc section and the topic is finished. Plays the game like everyone can and should and has a great time. (For the stupid people again. I'm not saying I support this mini scumbag store). Opinion This game has turned out great. It has its starting problems like every game these days, which shouldn't be standard but unfortunately is. But that's another topic. Rather this whining about a store that is 100% useless, from wimps who have come across a capcom game for the first time, not to mention dragons dogma for the first time, and then review bombing with 2 hours of playtime when it comes up is just incredibly sad and I am in no way behind this gamer generation. Educate yourselves more, go back to your fornite games, have fun somewhere else. Niche games have always been better anyway. Real Review The main story feels short but was the same in the first part. The world lives from side quests, from traveling long distances, from encounters with monsters, adventures and other creatures that are in the world. Traveling due to limited fast travel options is simply an ultra important aspect and it's done very well again. You find caves, chests, great landscapes, other items which makes the whole world incredibly dense in discovery. My biggest worry was that the world would be big and empty, but that's not the case at all. I would compare the world building to Elden Ring. If you are looking for something, you will always come across special things, awesome! Leveling is as much fun as in the first part and this time it seems a bit harder than back then. I'm the kind of player who grinds the crap out of something and doesn't stop milking the little lamb until it's empty. *cough* . So I think it's nice if you don't reach lvl 200 after 60 hours like in the first game. I am now lvl 54 with 60 hours and from now on I would say I am in the grind loop. Endgame: I miss this part. I know there was the bitter black isle later in the first part, but I mean in the first part the everfall was added after finishing the game and ur dragon slapping was just awesome. Something like that would have been cool but I can imagine that such content will be delivered later. New game + is of course available again. Conclusion I can recommend this game to anyone who wants to get excited about a really cool fantasy role-playing game that stands out from other games with its own strengths and, in my opinion, could be called a small genre of its own: Dogma like. You have to have played it. Anyone who doesn't want to pay the full price here, which is very understandable in these times, should get the first part for a few bucks and see if this series is for you.Rating: 85/100",1
Positive,"Running on an RTX 3060Ti and i7-10700kf on 1080p ultrawide getting locked 60fps and 40fps in city on nearly maxed settings. Performance isn't as bad as people are making it out to be, but will likely be optimized soon especially in cities. The game itself is great and improved from the first. Be wary of bad monetization, but they are largely unnecessary and complaints are overblown.",1
Positive,sees minimum specs>gtx 1070>runs it with gtx980m>gets 30fps>Happy it runs,1
Positive,"I've heard others have had performance issues, but the game works great for me even with ray tracing on and with a 2080 graphics card. I'm really happy with the team of pawns I put together.",1
Positive,"Dragon's Dogma 2 is a flawed game, But It's still better than most other games.They let Itsuno cook.",1
Positive,"Honestly, ignore the complaining about the MTX. You don't need them and they wouldn't really help you all that much. The game is the sort where it is fun to just wander around and see when you find. I love it.",1
Positive,It turns out the real Dragons Dogma 2 was the barely clothed friends we made along the way,1
Positive,So first and foremost the MTX is pointless. its all available in game so just dont buy it. and some people (not me) are having performance issues. ive had 4 crashes in 144 hours and i lost no progress on any of them.all that aside the game is awesome its everything i wanted from a sequel. its dragons dogma turned up to 11. all the core gameplay from the first with improvements and better graphics. 10/10 would get thrown of a cliff by a cyclops again.ps heres hoping they release a DLC as good as biter black isle or better.,1
Positive,Micro sucks but its consumables that you can gain 100's of in game sucks they added it as an option but it isnt going to force you to buy anything graphics are insane and the combat/story are fantastic so far ALSO the animations are next level. UI is still kinda clunky but that's Japanese RPGS for you. My computer is very beefy so there will be some frame drops for lower end PC's just take note that its in the main city not out in the wilds over all I think Twitter people were just farming interaction bait make your own decision.,1
Positive,"The game is great. It s nothing majorly different, but has a handful of aspect that makes it fun. I ve beaten the first game a handful of times and attempted to do & get everything.This one is basically the first, but with a lot more added. First off: STOP complaining about Microtransactions. FFS. It s all bandwagon stuff & you LITERALLY can ignore it without a second thought. You get everything it offers within an hour or two of the game. No one seemed to complain about Street Fighter 6 about their micro-transactions and they were more greedy on there.The performance? Not doing so great as of right now but, I m surprisingly doing okay with it and I have a mid-grade gaming laptop, maybe less than mid and It s still playable.Everything is turned down, but I genuinely don t care. I just enjoy gameplay. I m usually at 35-45 FPS but again, I don t care lol. It s still playable. (Lv.42)In town though? Yes, it can take a toll however it s also not as bad. It s more lag, but I m still able to do what I need decently.In the end, this is (sadly) a constant thing with games and even though everyone hates it, it s basically the norm. It just came out and they re updating it as soon as it s ready.PS.If you think your PC is good, then go for it.If I lag playing Helldivers 2 & you don t, then you literally should be fine compared to me lol.",1
Positive,Ok so after playing the game for 8 hours i'm here to give my review. I'f seen alot pf complaints about MX which isnt true. 1 they are DLC so can only be bought once. 2 they are very easy to gain in game just by playing the game so everyone is jumping on the hate for the wrong reason.The fps for me i locked on 50fps on 4K which is good enough for me playing with ray tracing on and shadows mid and I dont have a high end rig.So far i only get a lower fps in the biggest city which plays between 40/50 which isnt too bad.What I dont like is the 1 character only thing which is stupid and they realised they made a mistake and said they are working on.Now overall the game is beautiful and combat is really amazing.I pre ordered this game and went through it even after all the hate and I dont regret it a little bit.It's been a very long time since I had a game that got me excited to get home to play.9/10 for me. Would get a 10 if they fixed the single character issue and make it easy to restart the game.,1
Positive,"The first thing I need to say; this game has a lot of sharpening to do.Yet, I don't understand what people are crying about. The graphics and storyline caught me instantly, it's so interesting to follow. As someone who played DD:DA it got me hooked almost immediately. I do have to say that the controls and movement do seem to be based on controller a lot, which I personally find pretty sad because I like to play with mouse and keyboard. Then again, this is Capcom and they have favored controller input a lot in the past (Monster Hunter being a good example).This game has a lot of potential and even if it's not what a full release should be (then again, which games are nowadays, tbh) it is playable, and for me, enjoyable. Even tho I hope they'll update performance and controls in the future (especially the fact that you can reset keybindings).Now to the ""you have to spend money to make a new character"" crap. Honestly, if people are stupid enough to spend money on that, it's their fault. Because you certainly do not have to. I restarted my first campaign without spending a dime because I did not like how my character looked in the end. Don't believe all the bs they post in the reviews just because they're mad. Yes, the game could be better. It could be worse too. Find it weird that there is no option to restart the campaign tho in the menu itself and that you have to manually delete files.That being said, have fun, wait if you want a more polished version but don't throw around lies.Over 'n' out, have a good one.",1
Positive,It's a second Dragon's Dogma. GOATed.,1
Positive,Fun game but in dire need of an optimization patch. Capcom should not slack and quickly put out a fix as soon as possible. Take Helldivers 2 as an example.,1
Positive,"Normally I would wait until I've beaten a single-player game to review it, but I feel like I have to say something:It's sad to see this game getting review bombed for the mere existence of microtransactions. I understand the initial knee-jerk reaction to hearing a single-player game has microtransactions, but the only reason the word ""microtransaction"" has a poor connotation is because of their effect on how games treat players who don't pay for them. While many other games would make in-game items inaccessible, or lock them behind a brutal grind to incentivize players to purchase them, Dragon's Dogma 2 merely allows players to purchase items that are already easily accessible simply by playing the game. These items existed in the first game, and are largely unchanged in the second in terms of functionality, price, and general accessibility. The only difference is players are now allowed to purchase them for real money if they so desire. This isn't predatory, nothing is changed in the user experience except that an extra layer of convenience is available to them for a fee. Even modding is apparently unaffected. The game has been out for mere days, and already there are mods to add items or boost stats. These mods are not being taken down or blocked by the developers. There is not a single thing that the existence of microtransactions in this game has infringed upon. I will agree with some other reviews in that performance leaves a bit to be desired on my machine, but that's not at all unexpected for a brand new game on a computer that was built before Covid. I don't know how performance might be on a better machine, but while my computer struggles to maintain 60fps, the game has not once dropped below 30fps, so it's already doing better than some other games I own. While I do prefer seeing games in higher framerates, Dragon's Dogma 2's gameplay is slow-paced enough that I have never been inconvenienced by poor performance. So how is the game itself? I'll need to play through it fully to say for sure, but 20hrs in, I am enjoying the experience so far. Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen was one of my favorite games of all time. The combat was very unique, and still is to this day: few games allow you to pick up a fallen enemy and throw it at its allies like a living bowling ball, then scale a 30-ft tall monster and shoot arrows down into its skull like you're Legolas on a cave troll. The pawns were an amazing concept: personal companions from parallel worlds assisting you and teaching you of things they learned while traveling with other players. The world felt so interconnected and alive: npcs making comments on things that have changed within their world as a result of quests you've completed across the land. All I wanted from Dragon's Dogma 2 was everything we had in the original, but with some of its existing systems expanded and some small quality of life changes to make the game feel more modern. And so far from what I've played, it seems like that's exactly what we've gotten. Combat is still good and more fluid than ever. Climbing and toppling large foes has been refined with additional mechanics that are intuitive. Pawns are even more unique and informative and have more varied dialogue. They'll still repeat things they've said, but it's less frequent and with more variation, and pawns will instead say ""I thought that too"" or ""I agree"" instead of repeating what another pawn has already said. And though I'll never touch the system myself, if you're really struggling and strapped for time, you have the option of buying some items with real money to make your life a little easier.",1
Positive,Do wolves hunt in packs or not? I'm confused.,1
Positive,Just buy a good pc!,1
Positive,Really fun game just needs to fix performance issues,1
Positive,"Gameplay is great, physics are amazing, graphics look amazing, seems to have a lot of content, don't have any performance issues except in major cities which even then 40fps for not fighting is alright. of course launch couldve been better but the game is really great and a lot of fun.",1
Positive,"Ignore all the comments on the performance of the game and any negativity and TRY IT FOR YOURSELF. Trust me. Keep an open mind and try it. It is a SANDBOX RPG WITH one of the most DYNAMIC AI AND FREEDOM OF ACTIONS that will ever exist. No other games will have this level of AI and freedom to play with it. Combine that with a world that is full of dynamicism(?) like construction of cities, travelling patrols/hunters/merchants, random events/quests that doesn't seem out of place and I swear there's no reason to stop playing this game. It is the ultimate fantasy role playing simulator.I played Dragon's Dogma Dark Arisen when I was a teenager, and like many, i was super sad that there was no sequel that was announced, or even any news about the future of the franchise after I finished playing the game.Imagine how excited I was when this game was announced. Albeit I had no plans to purchase this immediately due to my financial situation at the time of the release. I guess I was a bit lucky because I avoided the duration of time where Capcom had to optimize and stabilise the game. I understand that optimization is a huge thing due to how big games are(in terms of scope and amount of power in the engine) in this generation, I guess it was a simple case of unforeseen circumstances or oversight that led to the minor optimization issues. I'm glad to say that the optimization issues are good now, even with RTX3060Ti I didn't expect it to run with 60fps. Even now, I can see that Capcom has not abandoned this game and is pushing optimization updates to cater to players that complain and complain and complain because they are stuck on 59.999999fps and need that UMPH EXTRA BIT OF OPTIMIZATION TO GET THAT PERFECT 60++++++FPS. Jeezz.Honestly, I'm also a bit worried that all the negative comments from players(either just jumping in the bandwagon/mob mentality) will make Capcom think twice to continue this franchise, because the way I see it, there are no games to have ever exist or will ever exist that will be the same/have the same feeling as playing Dragon's Dogma. On a side note, for those people that mod Skyrim to the max for better animations, better gameplay, better AI and better looking FX and all that. This is the perfect game for you. Trust me. I'm that type of person, that tweaks things here and there to get that satisfactory gameplay or whatever it is that is seemingly unsatisfiable(?) when tweaking a game, and trust me when I say, this game, gets it totally right.The amount of unexpected and dynamic epic/funny/awesome moments you will get out of this game is seemingly endless due to the intelligent AI of enemies and your pawns(your AI buddies). Give it a try, but do not rush it. Immerse yourself in it and at least play until the fifth mission. You will not regret it. Ultimately.just have fun!",1
Positive,"Writing this from the perspective of a fan of the first game, who probably logged over 6k hours across the platforms.Game is genuinely a straight upgrade from the first game, combat feels the same, but vastly improved. The environments are just incredible, making it a joy to travel and explore.The pawns, which in the first game were great, but had some rather big limitations. Are now constantly shocking me. They are talking to each other, seem to share information from their own adventures, and I might be losing my mind a bit. But. I think they're learning from each other? I can't figure it out, either I lost my final marbles, or I watched 1 warrior coach another on ""How to maul a cyclops 101"".As for performance, it leaves some to be desired, FPS drops pretty hard in larger cities, but seem to be otherwise really stable. It does need a lot of optimization work, but it is something I can work with at the moment. I've legit only had 2 crashes in 33.3 (at time of writing) hours.Lastly, I am still baffled by the microtransactions. Not that they're ""predatory"" in any way, just. Not worth considering.RC, or Rift Crystals, are earned from a number of ways, including opening chests, drops from enemies, as well as your own pawn returning to you after their adventures.In the first game, as well as this one, you quite literally can't keep up with how much RC you passively gain, you just don't need that much in all honesty.The ways to spend RC: Certain stores sell items, glasses mostly, as well as a voucher you can use at the Stylists to entirely remake your character. The prices range between a couple hundred and a few thousands, which are earned quite quick. If you want one of every item in the first major city, I believe about a week of just playing the game a few hours a day would get you there.All in all, I highly recommend this game, it is well worth the price, which I can't say for a lot of games.",1

Most of the game expect 50-60FPS if you set that cap (3080 12G + DLSS BALANCED AT 4K, 1260p internal). Game has a nice visual style. For game systems and other criticisms check the other reviews here, they are valid and don't let anyone else tell you they aren't.Don't buy anything from the microtransaction store you silly billy.",1

Positive,its an interesting game for sure. when its patched and updated a bit more im sure it will be better in the future. there have been a few rocky releases this is not one of the bad ones but its sadly not one of the great ones either. overall with time i think it will recover faster. i personally play offline always (network settings wise) obviously thats a bit limited with the devils DRM but. anyway offline in the sense of game features. The game requires you to just go out into the world and figure things out for yourself and im rather enjoying that. actually it even made me wan to go back and really dig into the first dogma as well. no chance on steamdeck at all with the performance and resource requirements. also with Denuvo you risk getting a ban if you change out proton version to much as it might register as new hardware.if you just go out into the world and explore and dont focus on finishing the main quests/story it will probably be a very long game especailly with NG+,1

Please don't buy them they're useless and Capcom's clearly trying to profit from idiots.Notes:As a PC player who doesn't own a controller and hasn't touched one for several years, the game thankfully works well without them. I tried the archer class for a bit but personally playing ranged classes with a mouse and keyboard didn't feel too great. After switching to fighter and rogue though I've been having a great time.",1
Positive,"This game is AMAZING. If you have a beffy rig, please ignore the backlash and get this game.The combat and exploration are amazing; I've lost hours just wandering around the world. Yeah, the performance is awful, but it is something I can ignore given how much I am enjoying the game. I'm getting from 60 to 90 fps on the open world and 30-45 in the big cities on 1440p.As for the microtransactions, literally EVERY SINGLE ITEM you can buy as a microtransaction, you can easily find them playing the game. As of right now, I'm 16 hours in, and I have 6 fast travel stones in my character's inventory. If you honestly need to spend money to get this type of item, you are a useless human being.",1
Positive,"literally unplayable due to crashingUPDATEif you have dual monitors turn your second monitor off, this fixed my crashing.Having a blast now",1
Positive,"Awesome game and I have not been having any performance issues.Make sure to update your drivers.I am running on a RTX 3070/i7 12th gen on 4k.Inside cities the fps does go to 40fps, but outside of that(when exploring) it holds up at 60fps.I do agree that MTX are not good. However, it is a requirement from Capcom and the devs put it there simply to check the requirements.The items are easily obtainable in-game. In addition to that, it is only possible to purchase the stuff in the store ONCE. So it is not p2w by any means.",1
Positive,"Everything about Dragon's Dogma 2 is unique and it means that not everyone is going to like it.Sure it has it's flaws, but this game is an absolute masterpiece.One of the best RPGs of all time, just like the original it's a gem, there is no other RPG that with immersion and player agency like this:The pawn system, exploration, combat, magic system, story (once you get to the true ending and everything comes together) all are phenomenal.It is difficult in the beginning and there's no handholding.Performance has been fixed, and the all micro-transactions items you can easily obtain in game.",1
Positive,This game is Phenomenal ! Spent all these hours and i haven't even covered 50% of the map yet ! Fights are tougher and poses serious threat if you do something wrong. Punishes you for wrong moves and timings. The map is huge and full of secrets that you can easily miss. There's just SO MUCH TO DO ! And the new mechanics are great ! Pawns are more responsive and helpful.Also Thanks to everyone who hired my pawn hehe . XoXo~,1
Positive,"Amazing game. Feels like Elden Ring had a baby with Outward/Monster Hunter and actually decided to keep the child.Disregard all reviews based on performance, bugs, etc. Irrelevant and will be improved over time. Just. like. literally every other game. So shut up.",1
Positive,"With almost 50 hours into the game and beating the game. I can say this is great game in the making, With hot fix's the performance in towns. This could be a game of the year title. The transactions problem is pointless, you don't need any of those transactions are just there. when you beat the game, you can recreate your character and your pawn at the start of new game plus. so there NO need to spend Rift Points or paying cash.",1
Positive,"In many ways its a fantastic experience and i've certainty had and have been having my fair share of great experiences in it. There are some areas where the game begins to show a need for optimizations like in the first major city, and certain cliff side areas, and the AI pawns decide to incorporate themselves into the ground by jumping off a cliff but aside from that its really fantasticYeah theres micro transaction, but literally all of those items and be gotten ingame, very early. Didn't like how your character ended up visual wise? Literally just play for like, 40 mins and once you make it to the first main town go to the barber and change it lmaoYou get wakestones so fast in this game compared to DD1 that I don't even know why its a micro transaction- i've already gotten 2 full ones in the few hrs i've played thus far. For real though, ignore that micro transactions exist because they will never affect you.",1
Positive,"I love this game. It is almost exactly the same as the first Dragon's Dogma, which I assume is why folks say it is a 2012 game with 2024 graphics. This is true, but I don't think that is a bad thing. The combat is fun, the character creation/customization is very in depth, and the open world is fun to explore. Some of the new classes are really cool. However, I miss some of the previous game's combat moves, specifically the sorcerer's moves. I also wish that some parts of the quests were a bit more straight forward. The likelihood that you will have an unfavorable ending to a quest is high because it's not always intuitive. In fact it's often extremely random what you are supposed to do to get the best outcome. But you won't know until you Google it. I wish there had been an eternal ferrystone. Ox travel is slow and the first half of the game ferrystones, for me at least, weren't as plentiful as I would have liked. But I really enjoy playing this game. It's expensive, but I have already put in enough hours of game play to more than pay for itself, which I cannot say for most of my movie and TV streaming services.",1
Positive,"Been playing Dragon dogma 1 ever since back on xbox 360 and have loved it ever since, I was overjoyed to play it again on pc Dark arisen was great fun.i always wished there would be a sequel and here we are.12 years later and i can scarcely believe it! to say that i was happy and hyped was a understatement!I spended days in the character creator of this game when the demo came out just to get my my character and main pawn like how they looked before or how i envisioned them i gues.although the game suffers from performance issues im still having much fun with it and the day i have played through it all will be a sad day but also happy one knowing i can just play it at ease knowing what to do just like before.i know they will eventually release a hard mode but right now the game feels a little to easy on new game+.Without spoiling anything i would say i was even more invested in what would happen to my arisen and pawn and after seeing the ending i cant help but feel things were just starting up and it left me feeling wanting more.Like any games it has its flaws but this is def my game of the year for 2024im excited to see the future of this game and its content that im sure they will bring along the way.(subject to add more later on as the add more thing) THE WIND IS PUSHING ME!",1
Positive,"TL:DR- If you liked the first one, I'm fairly confident you will like 2. If you never played the first game, this game is not your typical low effort game. The game isn't going to play itself or hand you a hot waifu because you killed a singular wolf. The game punishes people who don't take the time to buy/craft items and equipment, who don't read quests, and people who ignore their surroundings. Game is amazing. I loved the first game and this game really built on that foundation. Super uninterested in the micro transaction drama. Capcom does this with all their games from what I see. (MHW, MHR, MHS2, Resident Evil, Devil May Cry, ETC) This is an issue with Capcom not the games themselves. Also, everything you can buy, you can get in the game with rather low effort and if you actually play the game you can easily find better. I acknowledge people are having problems running the game on their pc which is indeed an issue with games. I personally have the settings at max and have yet to have issues. My computer is rather average and the game runs great, even in towns so there's that. If you are a fan of the first game there is so much to love. The quality of life and game play updates the vocations received are glorious. The stats you gain from leveling change when you switch vocations so if you play Sorc for a long time and decide to switch to fighter you aren't going to feel like a paper noodle. Different regions have different enhancement styles. There are more large monster encounters so you don't have to worry about fighting a griffin once or twice. Tons of little secrets and shortcuts that can move you around the map. Fashion can be on point from heavy armor, to looking like a whore. All in all its great.",1
Positive,"The original was better in almost every aspect, sadly, but this one has one of the best open-worlds ever. Really enjoyable and unique game",1
Positive,Step 1: Play ThiefStep 2: Pick up the Ensnare SkillStep 3: Find a pigStep 4: Hook the pigStep 5: LaughRepeat steps 3-5 until you've gotten your moneys worth,1
Positive,"I don't see what everyone's complaining about. You should love having to hotswap a new ssd once a week with Denuvo, It really enhances the immersion in the game. I'm already 2000$ invested into this game and its not even 24hr after launch. Already bought myself a good few hundred ferry stones and thousands of RCs. honestly it would really be awesome if they could add more micro transactions like maybe a game finisher. So It can automatically finish the game for me. I don't see why people are complaining about performance issues, stop being broke and buy a rtx 4090 already smh. I'm running at 4k max settings 120fps perfectly fine. Don't call yourself a real Dragons Dogma fan if you aren't willing to put at least 10,000$ into having a good PC to run it. Also I have Jesters privilage",1
Positive,I summoned a Pawn and his first inclination was to sit down.I believe this will be the start of a beautiful partnership!,1
Positive,Its a great game. It's been a while since I get the Souls-like feeling of adventure from a game. The MTX doesn't really matter nor make sense to purchase. Performance was actually decent on my average PC.,1
Positive,"Good game, needs lots of polishing, until then definitely wait for sale. Most micro transactions for items can be unlocked in base game as well. Either discovered or bought from a merchant.",1
Positive,"Bought it day one, and played so much I missed the controversy. The one's whose experiences were ruined by microtransactions are, putting it gently, barking up the wrong tree. I suspect the CPU issues will be resolved with patches eventually, and while it's definitely annoying that triple A games are being sold at $70 and have issues like this, it's also nothing new, and I think it says more about the corporate spheres than it does the devs or the game, so I can't justify having that impact the score too much. Putting that aside, the game itself is basically if Skyrim and Breath of the Wild had a baby. The random encounters are literally cinema. Leveling up feels good. Getting new weapons / vocations / skills is fun but not completely necessary to have fun, ie you don't need to master the systems to excel in the game, but mastering them makes you stronk. The NPCs are engaging, and there are consequences to all your interactions with them. I got a somewhat prominent NPC killed, and I didn't realize in time to revive him, and now I notice the space he used to occupy every time I pass it, and it makes me feel really bad. Amazing game. Worth the buy 100%, maybe wait for a sale, but idk.",1
Positive,"It's a great game, but greatly hampered by bad performance issues. Especially in cities and areas with lots of NPCs the performance is unacceptable. Also, microtransactions in full price (singeplayer) games is some extra crap on top.But besides these issues, it's a fantastic game. The combat is amazing, the world is engaging, and stumbling upon sidequests and or secrets out of nowhere feels really cool. The game has some hardcore mechanics, like limiting fast travel, is strict on its carry weight rules, but this also is part of this game's charm. It's something different than usual and it's also something I appreciate for a change.The game doesn't really hold your hand, and many times doesn't even give you quest markers. The best moments are when you stumble upon a huge boss, and the game is like you can figure it out. You can climb it and stab it in its weakness, you can try to shove it off a cliff with a huge blast, or just defeat it by taking your time and dodge its attacks. The world and it's combat are basically a mix of a huge sandbox and playground.So yeah, I mostly recommend this game because it's just really, really fun. But especially when Capcom fixes the performance issues. Luckily enough, they already promised this, so I hope to see this soon.",1
Positive,This game is exactly what I want from a DD title. I'm 108 hours invested at the time of this review and I have no plans of stopping. I'm a simple man who's been gaming short of 4 decades so my tolerance is extremely high. I really enjoyed DDDA and was looking for more of the same and it's exactly what I got with DD2 and some. My only complaints are the side quests being tedious at times and monster variety. I wasn't expecting a long main story just from my experience with DD as that's not the focal point of this game. Here's to hoping DLC makes its way some day. The game to me feels like OG Fable meets Elden Ring. Zero money spent on MTX and if you actually play the game you'd realize how easy it all is to obtain.,1
Positive,"Quite similar to the original, but improvements across the board. Wonderful world building.However, the notes about taxing your system are no joke.",1
Positive,"You guys should've been crying about Capcom's microtransactions several games ago, because it sucks seeing this game be the one to get review bombed.This game is amazing and you don't have to spend a single extra cent.",1
Positive,isekai the game,1
Positive,"Yes! there is a few bits here and there. but overall very very good.And BTW, the game has never crashed. not sure what everyone else is doing. But works like a charm for me. Some FPS issues here and there. but nothing game breaking.",1
Positive,"Incredible fun game. Combat feels great, the world is well done and the music in the game is awesome. Story is nice as well, but not the best part about the game. Luckly the game ran overall smooth for me. Can highly recommend this game to anyone who love to dive into a world.",1
Positive,"I found out the hard way and long story short I screwed myself over.If you do consider playing this. Be warned. Pick your pawns carefully. Some of them carry a disease that will wipe your whole city and kills everyone that's within it - and hard lock you out of your progression. Look out for glowing red eyes, a bad temper, head aches and reckless behaviour, If you see any of this, Throw them into the closest river and forget it ever happened.Overall, I had a great time.8.8/10 Would get the Dragon Clap again.",1
Positive,"The launch of DD2 reminds me of the launch of MHW, and I am pretty sure that the sequence of events will follow the same pattern: performance issues will resolve, and everyone will suddenly just play the game and go 'oh, this is pretty good, actually,' and we'll all move on with our lives. I can't speak to the performance issues people have been having, as I haven't had any, myself. Those always suck when they affect people's ability to play and I sympathize. With a i9-12900K and 3090, I haven't had any issues.I don't think my rig is *cutting edge* anymore, but it's probably still pretty chonky, idk.But I CAN address the extreme hyperventilation about the DLC: you literally do not need to spend any precious dollarydoos on those things to have a complete game experience. This is not a gacha, lol. Your play experience will be 100% unaffected by any choice NOT to buy those things. It would be like.if Monster Hunter World got review-bombed for selling gourmet vouchers, or something, without altering how you get them in normal play. You will end up with about five billion of them just through playing the game. And MHW *does* sell character appearance editing vouchers, so.that's pretty much exactly the same.Listen. I am fucking old and grew up when DLC wasn't even a thing, in the days before kids posted 'dead game' on things that are just literally *finished games,* because they have never known a time when games used to be things that developers finished and packaged up and sent out, and that was the end of it. I get the disdain for DLC. I just think the reaction here is out of all proportion to what's actually going on. I think some people saw it and got agitated and now everybody is on the agitated anti-hype train, and pretty soon, once the performance wrinkles are ironed out, people will get back to actually playing the game, realize that they never needed the dlc items even one time, and eventually forget that they ever wailed and gnashed their teeth, because the microtransactions here are of absolutely no consequence whatsoever. I cannot even fathom a reason that I would ever want to buy any of them outside of the appearance editor voucher, tbh, and even that one can be obtained in play. So.yeah.Game is good. Dire arrow feels fun. Go smash some big monsters and roam the countryside hucking goblins off of cliffs so that your hired support pawns learn how to do that, and take that knowledge back with them to their master's game. Fun times.",1
Positive,"Dragon's Dogma 2. Why am i recommending this game? Let's start with the ups and downs, and i'll put an anecdote in as a closer. I've played this game for 11 hours now, so i may change a few things the more i play.Ups:- Graphics. Be amazed at the world you're in, you can see into the far distance, and odds are if you see it you can reach it. With a MUCH larger map comes much more to explore, and DD2 offers a lot in that department. Monsters look amazing, with highly detailed models and amazing effects that occur when you set them on fire, electrocute them or do god knows what.-Combat: What is there to say? It's a massive improvement over 1. The initial changes i heard of were a source of confusion, but now that i have played it, i can see why they went this route: If you play a lightly-armoured thief, you'll zip around the battlefield and stab everyone in their critical spots. If you're a fighter, you'll hold your ground and do what you can to keep your enemies away from your allies. It feels great, and quite frankly is THE main draw of Dragon's Dogma.-Story and voice work: I haven't gotten far into the story yet, but the sheer number of questions that i have despite (and partly because of) having played 1 has left me yearning for more. Some of the commonfolk NPC sound a bit dull, but the pawns are the main draw here. Where in 1 they'd repeat the same texts ad nauseum, the amount of voice lines and how they're delivered is interesting! I feel like i'm having uncanny valley make remarks about the world around them, the quests they're on and even the party composition. Which makes sense, when you learn of what pawns are story wise.Downs:-Performance: This one's an obvious one that a lot of people have issues with: There's some performance drops in combat and larger settlements, and i HAVE heard of people experiencing crashes. Fortunately, Capcom has already stated that they're addressing and fixing this and my next issue soon, so let's hope they do. [edit]: A patch has been released fixing the performance issues a bit, larger settlements now run much smoother. [/edit]-New Game: So this is kind of an odd decision: There's no new game function for now. Perhaps it was bugged and they couldn't fix it in time for launch, perhaps it wasn't intended to be in. Either way, this was weird and inexcusable to me.Both the previous and current points listed here are fairly bad in my book, and if you want to wait for a patch to sort this out, you're valid in thinking this: the game isn't going anywhere.[edit]: A patch has been released adding a New Game option.[/edit]-Monetisation: As there's a lot of drama surrounding it, let me tell you this: Capcom has monetised its IP's in this manner for more than a decade, even the first game suffered from having rift crystal packs you could buy. Whilst i do not hold it against the game, as almost everything you can get in the store is EASY to get in game, i DO condemn Capcom and the greed of its executives, they are the main culprit in this i feel, and the developers and designers/creators should not be faulted for needing to tick off the corporate checklist lest their funding be struck. Do not bother with the DLC items, as they're literally convenience and meant to trick you into thinking that stuff is rare and/or necessary. It's not, they're not. Vote with your wallet and let the DLC store items sit there and gather dust. Find them in-game and enjoy yourself.-Anecdote:So. Earlier today i was resting in one of the major cities and preparing to exit when i was greeted with an unusual sight: The townsfolk started panicking. As it turns out, a giant armoured cyclops had entered town (which is possible due to the ABSENCE OF LOADING SCREENS BETWEEN AREAS) and had begun to rampage. I sprang into action alongside the local guard and started fighting the beast, but i wanted to down it quick due to the sheer amount of people there. Being a thief means i had access to some interesting giant killing tools, in particular interest was a grappling hook i could use to latch onto enemies and either pull them towards me, pull them out of the sky. or yank at their limbs if they're too big otherwise. After stripping its leg armour i set to work using the grappling hook to control the cyclops away from the larger crowds and into a relatively tight space between two buildings. Having pulled him away i started cutting away at him, until he started losing his balance. I then got an idea: He was relatively low health, i knew i could finish him if he'd get knocked down again, so i used my grappling hook to send him tumbling. Except i had forgotten that he was next to a large building: He slammed his head into the building as he fell and died instantly. His low health coupled with the damage from the impact meant he died fast, so i stood there a bit confused.then started looting.-Conclusion:Dragon's Dogma 2 is a masterpiece and you can't go wrong: As a returning fan i love what they've done and look forward to burning hundreds of hours playing and replaying the game. If you have the money to spare and think it's worth a try, then i wholeheartedly recommend the game, with its varied play styles, classes and party combinations you can make with your and your friends' pawns. Its main flaws are addressable by patch or by simply ignoring the existence of the DLC store.The vision of this game is marvellous, such that the blemishes wrought on by corporate greed do not really bother me all that much.",1
Positive,"The game is great even with it's problems. Yes there are micro transactions, but if you play the game you will realize you don't actually need any of them and anyone complaining about it is a little ridiculous. Things people complain about:People complain of the travel, but with the amount of enemies and things to explore it keeps you pretty busy. You get up to 10 Riftstones that you can place anywhere and port to them anytime you wish. You need Ferrystones that you can buy in every town and the shops reset daily. Gold may seem hard to obtain in the beginning of the game, but as you progress you have so much you don't even know what to do with it all. You can hire pawns from other people that have 10k gold reward if you kill certain enemies. Get 2 of those pawns go kill a cyclops boom you made 20k in like 4mins. There is a cart that can take you to pretty much all the main areas so traveling can be very fast if you want it to be. When the game released there was a lot of lag and performance issues but i feel like that's mostly been fixed.People complain about losing max health while out fighting. This can be negated by getting the augment from warrior vocation that makes you lose less max health when hit. There are certain vocations that make you pretty much immune to damage cough thief cough. You can also restore max health from campfires which are EVERYWHERE or in town at an inn. BUT THAT COSTS MONEY so buy the house in the 2 main towns and sleep for free.People complain about performance issues. Well that has pretty much been solved. I have an older PC with a 3060gfx card and the game runs fine now. I will admit those first few days were bad though.People complain about the story. Well even Dragons Dogma Dark Arisen's story wasn't that good. I will admit Dragon's Dogma 2 isn't that great of a story either, but who cares about the story when the combat is as fun as it is! If you want a story go play final fantasy.-SPOILER-People complain about dragon plague and yes I also think this is a bit on the cancer side for the game. Knowing you can kill everyone in your town when you go to sleep is annoying. You have to make sure you check your pawns before you rest or remove all other pawns and kill yours to be safe. There are big signs though like them rubbing their heads and eyes turning red. The pawns may call you stupid and complain of headaches. No reason you shouldn't notice this stuff. I've played a lot and haven't killed a town yet. I would recommend this game to my friends. Combat is great, the vocations are fun even though I'm not a fan of Mage or Trickster. They are too back seat for me. Warrior, Sorc, Thief, Warfare, and Magick Archer are my favorites and all seem to make the game super easy. Hope this review helps anyone who is on the fence reading the negative reviews from the first few days of the launch of the game.",1
Positive,"15 hours in and so far I am thoroughly enjoying it and do not regret buying it. But it is not without its flaws:Pros:* Stuck true to the original - this game has kept the feel of the previous Dragon's Dogma which I know a lot of fans, myself included, really appreciate. This game isn't for everyone but if you loved the first one, this one does it justice in my opinion* Combat feels more fluid than the original game and I've not yet got bored of encountering things in the world (and running away if needed)* Vocations are a lot of fun to try out and there is enough armor/weapons to be found to keep it engaging* Exploration is the make or break of this game. If you don't go exploring everywhere you will miss out on so much and your game play will be diminished. I love the fact you have to explore more organically than just visiting quest markers, and work things out for yourself. It's very rewarding.* Storyline - so far the storyline has been engaging and I'm intrigued to know more* The pawn system is a lot of fun and there has been an effort made to make it more engaging to players compared to Dragon's Dogma 1. Pawns sharing knowledge between players based on their owners play through is a lot of fun.Cons:* Performance is a bit hit and miss (but I must admit my PC specs, specifically the VRAM, are under even the min requirements for this game so I was never expecting it to be perfectly smooth.) Out in the world it plays fine, in the city I do suffer a few frame drops* Almost game ruining mechanic - now this is a big one for me personally. There is a specific mechanic in this game that affects pawns called dragonsplague. I won't post spoilers here but if you want to look it up please do. This mechanic does have the capacity to do something that has disastrous consequences that can ruin quests for you. In a game where there isn't multiple save slots this was a silly decision, as there is no going back once it happens. There is a way to ""undo"" what has happened but it takes a lot of effort and/or grinding.* Adding to the above Con - only 1 save file. Now I don't mind this massively but what I do mind is not even having the option to delete that 1 save file if you wanted to start again. There is a work around to delete it via your pc files but come on.I love the game but let's be honest here, this shouldn't be happening in a game at this level.Neutral:* There is a lot of talk about micro-transactions. But honestly, you do not need them. This game is similar to its predecessor in the sense you are going to walk around a lot (that's how you encounter things) but in my 15 hours I have never once struggled for money or ferrystones (the fast travel stone).Overall I am thoroughly enjoying my experience and I would recommend this game but I understand it won't be for everyone.",1

Positive,"In the depths of my gaming odyssey, I delved into realms where mastery meant more than just defeating beasts; it meant unravelling their secrets, understanding their vulnerabilities, and forging bonds with characters in a way that felt almost transcendent in our modern era of gaming. Every journey was an epic saga, every encounter a chance to grow not just in strength, but in camaraderie.Venturing clandestinely through the southern border to reach Battahi was no easy feat. With cunning strategy and the aid of my loyal companions, we concocted a scheme involving disguises, transforming ourselves into feline infiltrators to slip past vigilant guards. The road to Battahi was fraught with peril bandits, poisonous reptiles, winged harpies, and colossal stone behemoths all sought to impede our progress. Yet, amidst the chaos, we discovered the true essence of our quest lay not in the destination, but in the bonds we forged and the trials we faced together.Arriving in Battahi, we were met with wary glances from the locals, but undeterred, we pressed on. Amidst the bustling city streets, a gleaming weapon in the marketplace caught my eye the legendary Great Sword of the Wounded Heart. Determined to possess it, I resolved to return once our current mission was complete, a promise that fate would test in unexpected ways.Our mission led us to the Flamebearer Palace, where secrets awaited discovery and danger lurked in the shadows. As we journeyed back towards the border, a fierce battle with a armoured Cyclops left our transportation in ruins, forcing us to make the final leg of our journey on foot.Returning to Vermund with vital information in hand, I was rewarded handsomely by Sven, enough to acquire the coveted Wounded Heart. Yet, as I pondered my next move, a chance encounter with Wilhelmina sparked a different kind of temptation one that would test my resolve in ways I never imagined.In a moment of impulse, I succumbed to the allure of indulgence, trading my hard-earned coin for fleeting pleasure. Yet, as the screen faded to black and the realisation of my actions set in, a profound sense of emptiness washed over me. The fleeting ecstasy of the moment paled in comparison to the weight of my choices, leaving me questioning the true value of my pursuits.In the aftermath, as I grappled with the consequences of my actions, I came to a profound realisation: true strength isn't measured in conquests or acquisitions, but in the discipline to resist temptation and the courage to face the darkness within ourselves. Through the trials of this game, I learned a valuable lesson in self-control and the true nature of my aspirations to be not just a formidable warrior, but a virtuous one, guided by principle and tempered by experience.This Game is truly game of the year 10/10.",1
Positive,The camping scene blew me away with that live action camp roast. Love it.,1
Positive,"I enjoy it more than Elden ring. People overreacted for the mtx nonsense, I would not even call this mtx, it is some useless DLC that almost all games have. The game itself deserve nothing but prise, the only real issue is performance but it is far from being a game breaking. I recommend it strongly to anyone who likes this genre, wont regret it.",1
Positive,"A masterpiece! 115 hours only for the first playthrough. Best combat mechanics, fantastic graphics, decent story and great dragons. Better than the prequel. Is it perfect? Of course not. But still almost perfect and simply so much fun. My game of the year! 10/10.",1
Positive,"first and foremost. I would like to say yes I would recommend this game. I particularly enjoy the dark souls like combat, the mobility is exceptional yet very grounded. I do have to be honest that much of the game NPC interactions are a bit too forward by means of moving the plot with very little nuance. when it comes to the main quest characters there is so much ""here have this bucket of respect and this one, oh and look behind you we brought you a truck load of respect have it all. no you just proved your worth when you laid back like a hero while we attacked that troll but we couldn't have done it without you blowing up a dam and sweeping us a great distance down a river whilst destroying a naturally occurring boon to our infrastructure but yeah, we owe you a great deal of gratitude. but for all the goofy stuff this game does as an oversight so early in the game I do love the the gritty visuals, the towns aren't vibrant, they are brown, simply brown. this is supposed to be a medieval fantasy and it delivers. no one speaks with modern slang or a watered down version of it. for the first 20 hours I'm still running from minotaur hoping my companions dont die. I was really impressed when I was being chased by one only to be intercepted by a griffon mid flee and instead managed to begin a minotaur vs griffon gaiju battle which was awesome to see before they both took an interest in me once more after I ventured too close and planted an explosive for both of them. I really do like the timed missions that change outcome by not completing the objectives in time which is refreshing experience compaired to more linear titles. I do love that you can request other companions to join you provided you have the space.",1
Positive,"(Small preamble on performance: Game ran decently well locked at 30fps on 3440x1440 resolution in my GTX 1080 i7-7700k system. Other than CPU frame-timing issues in the two big main towns of the game, I have no real complaints, and the game still looked pretty good despite the lowered settings. This is just my personal experience.)Steam said my review was way too long so below is a condensed version of it, my full review is here: https://pastebin.com/DnM6GejXAfter twelve years since the original, a game I was a fan of since I was half my age; Capcom and director Hideaki Itsuno finally give us a numbered sequel to the cult-classic original. Mild spoilers for the review ahead. . . .It's not the sequel I wanted.The sequel 12 year old me wanted all those years ago; was a direct sequel to the first called Dragon's Dogma 2 released three-or-less years after Dark Arisen (which released a year after the original) that reused mostly the same assets to add even more monsters to fight, vocations to play, giving Warrior an L1 button, and building upon the storyline of the first, with improvements.But that would've never happened, it didn't happen; especially for those of us in the west that never got to play Dragon's Dogma Online which did technically work on some of those aspects, but also while failing in others, and so. I reconciled those feelings long ago. It is clear instead, that Itsuno had different things in mind for this sequel. Some great, some not so great, but I can say that, after at least 80 hours of playtime, and finishing the game with the true ending. That I do appreciate what he's tried to do and accomplished with parts of this game nonetheless, and I accept it as a new entry in the franchise without any bitter feelings for the wait, so long as this foundation is worked upon for hopeful future installments (and we aren't made to wait 24 years next time). The little quirks of soul and inspiration that this game possesses, that my mind could've never thought or dreamed of, that carry forward the spirit of adventure and discovery that made me fall in love with the original alongside it's fresh action-RPG combat, are what keep me most positive about this.I never would've thought of the Sphinx encounter, if I did it would be a simple boss fight of no consequence just like in DDON, nothing that really rocks the formula of other Dragon's Dogma encounters; but I wouldn't have thought of solving riddles and having a test of wit with the mythical beast like in the legends, I wouldn't have thought of being able to fulfill the Greek hero fantasy of being able to lop off a Medusa's head and using it's decapitated gaze to petrify any foe, even the final boss, I wouldn't have thought of pulling back on the handholding even harder for the game's questing and exploration and leaning into the emergent narrative and gameplay possibilities of this game and it's pawns, I would've never considered the Beastren nation and all its little intricacies despite knowing they were cut content of the original concept or all the stuff dealing with the Sacred Elf Arbor, never would've thought of improvements like the different upgrade disciplines or the change to the previously RNG dragonforging system. So on and so forth.My imagination extended to the first game, Dark Arisen and maybe some cut content, and it is these things that were outside of my imagination that are impressing me the most and will stick with me that make this game carve out it's own identity from the first. Alongside these new bits and pieces, there are ofcourse improvements to the climbing system such as being able to stand on parts of monsters strategically, monsters being able to lose their balance, giving more importance to heavy attacks due to the changes in the stagger mechanic, making the game less easy and long journeys more perilous with the addition of the Loss Gauge mechanic, among many others small to big improvements. . .I think that, if you are a new fan especially and someone not familiar with the first game, this should be enough for you; to figure out if you would like this game or not. I do think even at it's current price point and especially on any sale there is still enough value for newcomers to have a fun time and enjoy a great japanese western-inspired RPG adventure. I'm sure it will only get better with patches, and as hardware catches up, like with Red Dead 2 or Cyberpunk.The game IS an improvement in many aspects, I like plenty of it and I had more fun playing it than I have with a new release in recent years, and a Capcom game since DMCV. It is precisely because I love the original Dragon's Dogma, and that I like this game; that I put forward all these points forward which they can improve upon so that it can hopefully become better and better. Whether that takes the form of Title Updates or an expansion that would hopefully put Dark Arisen to shame.However, do note the difference in language there. In its current state, Dragon's Dogma 2 was simply unable to replace the unshakable, fond spot that the original game has in my heart, and in that sense, that's my biggest disappointment of all, not being able to bring myself to love it as much as I do the original, but it still retains it's soul and spirit, carrying it into the modern era, and thus I like it all the same. Newcomers have nothing to fear, it's an excellent jumping point for them to play this already.And for the few of us present fans. The game is a spring of potential, just waiting to be fully tapped and unleashed with some sort of expansion like Monster Hunter World was with Iceborne, and this budding young franchise barely in its second entry still has room to grow with sequels, even disconnected from it's director as it has in the past with Dark Arisen and Dragon's Dogma Online, as other Capcom franchises like Monster Hunter and Resident Evil do.In the end, with Dragon's Dogma II. It's a dichotomous game, both safe and bold at the same time, both an improvement and a downgrade, better and worse, larger and smaller, wilder and more restrained. My feelings on it still need to fully cement, it's not the sequel I wanted. But I think that's fine, I think I can live with that. I just hope I don't have to wait another decade to find out which side of the dichotomy it will truly turn out to be, looking back. Please do give us more Capcom, don't make us wait too long for a sequel or expansion ever again.",1

Positive,"it's a good game but performance is pretty bad, wait for a few patches before buyinginstead of complaining about microtransactions (which is a capcom staple at this point) you can wait 3 days for a cheat engine table to cheat in wakestones/rift crystals to your hearts content",1
Positive,"The Dragon's Dogma series is one that places a greater emphasis on the journey, as opposed to the destination. You'll form a group with 3 AI companions, and set out to explore the world. While there is a main plot to uncover, the game is at its best when you're exploring the edges of the map, scavenging to stay alive, and experimenting with the various classes.That said, If you've never played Dragon's Dogma before you should go play the first game, Dark Arisen, instead. You'll avoid the controversies, the poor optimization, and the lack of variety/endgame. Then if you end up enjoying it, you can check back on this one after some much needed patching, and hopefully some form of expansion.",1
Positive,"Like the original but better, great example of how to do an open world and encourage exploration. ""I just need to follow the road north a little bit"" turned into a three hour journey that finished so far south that I was in the neighbouring country.You can get all the MTX in regular gameplay with no difficulty at all. Sucks that they're in the game, but it's another DMC5 situation.",1

Positive,THE WIND IS PUSHING ME INTO THE CLOUDS AGAIN,1
Positive,"Nearing the end of the game now, 70 hours in.I have explored every dungeon I have come across, tried to find every sidequest (probably missed one or two).I've fought pretty much every enemy type.This game, like the first, takes some design choices that many people won't agree with, such as limiting the fast travel or cryptic quests.Most of the reviews you will see on steam are people being negative over the MTX, it's dumb yeah, but capcom has been doing this for ages, go look at Tales of Arise, you can actually just buy levels in the MTX there.The MTX items available for Dragon's Dogma 2 are all available in game except for the heartfelt pendant and the explorer's Camping kit, however there are alternates of these items available ingame that are either better, or close.The combat is superb, just like the first game, some Vocations (Classes) are missing from the first, and were promised to have been represented in some way or two by skills being given to other classes, sadly this is not 100%, for example: The Mystic Knight.Mystic Knight's Elemental Shield reflecting was given to fighter, but with no way to self buff your shield as a fighter, you have to rely on a mage pawn, so this is already much worse than Mystic Knight, so the Paladin style gameplay is missing.Thief not having a bow or double jump like Strider did feels a bit limiting, but the thief excels in melee so well that I can accept that.Now the Archer is a bit controversial to me, In DD1, the Ranger had a longbow AND daggers, where as in dd2, the Archer only gets a bow, your only source of melee is a kick, and your only way to avoid taking damage is to run away or jump kick flip off enemies, where as in DD1, every class that had daggers also got the roll dodge.This means that if you are caught unaware, and 3 goblins start to smack away at you, you get stunlocked with no way to free yourself other than hoping your pawns help you, or that there is a pause in the stunlock for a sec for you to either kickflip off an enemy or start sprinting.Sorcerer got gutted, while it still does good damage, it does so in less ways, as all of the fun spells from DD1 were removed, except for Maelstrom and Bolide.Glicel, Execui, Fulmination, Brontide, Comestion, Miasma, Torpor of all kinds. all gone.Mage however now feels quite strong, some new support spells makes it one of the most reliable casters you can bring, High Palladium and Celerity feel so strong.The music is pretty good, I do miss the Leitmotif of the first game, but theres a 2 dlc for that, I've not bought it, but I might.Dragon Plauge is a mechanic I wont go into too much, but it could have been much more interactive, like letting the player fight their diseased pawn-turned-dragon, instead of just murdering the whole town in a cutscene and peacing out back to the void.The Performance at launch right now is abysmal, and some proper implementation of things like Frame Gen or just making sure the game doesnt murder your CPU constantly would make it a lot more playable, as is right now I have to use a mod that enables AMD FSR to double my framerate, and it comes with significant hud glitches as a side effect.I'm not one for numbering a review, as that doesnt help to speak for all the small things I like or dislike, and ultimately giving something a number just does not convey the actual quality or enjoyment one could get from the game.DD2 is a must play for anyone who is okay with a game that doesn't want to hold their hand, a game that isn't afraid to put you in a situation you can't just brute force your way through, sometimes you gotta run, or rethink that strategy.The only thing I feel the game sorely lacks is an endgame activity to grind like DD1's Everfall/Bitterblack Isle.That and another semi-online Raid like the UR Dragon.EDIT: I have now beaten the game, true ending and all.For people who played DD1, this is one of the most incredible experiences.New players might feel a bit confused, and/or lost.",1
Positive,"MTX and performance sucks (Only in towns for me) but I only review games based on the actual gameplay and story and not it's performance problems. Great open world and environment. Combat and Vocations were great.Main story is very short and never really got interesting for me.Side quests were meh. NPCs and Pawns felt robotic while repeat saying the same thing.I just finished the main story and I feel kind of ripped off with how fast I finished the game. I did most of the side quests I ran into, did a lot of exploring and was starting to feel out every class to see which one I would take to the end. Suddenly I'm fighting the last boss, killed it, and credits.Overall, I had fun in the time that I played this game, but I wish the story wasn't rushed and the writing could use some work. Buy if combat is all you care about, don't buy if story or the ""adventure"" aspect of it is important to you. Because story is non existent and the 'adventure' is VERY short lived.To put a number on it, 7/10 imo not worth the full price tag.",1
Positive,"2024 Game of the Year. Amazing graphics, gameplay, sound. This game has it all. Only thing I would add is PvP",1
Positive,i think that most people are overreacting with the lag in the game. i have a prebuilt computer (so not SUPER good but still reasonabley good specs) and it works really good on like down the middle of quality. it lags a bit when first stepping in a crowded place but after like 1-5 seconds of lag it runs smooth for like a 15 minutes and then have a small frame rate drop that quickly fixes itself. NOTHING makes it unplayable or disruptive that ive encountered in my 15 hours of play. i even had a large fight in the main city without any issue. ive played many other games that have gotten praise and high reviews that run much worse than this.,1
Positive,"Really good game!I love the companian mechanic. They have a lot of depth compared to other games.I love the RPG elements in the game. You travel, eat, sleep, interact with NPCS and the world.The combat is really fun and engaging.The only downsides are:Not optimised for PC.Not optimised for Keyboard and mouse. Its a pain to be a warrior with a shield in this game.",1
Positive,Pros: It s like the original Dragons Dogma.Cons:It s like the original Dragons Dogma.,1
Positive,Technology behind the game is top of the line. Gameplay wise the game is one step forward and two backwards compared to the first entry. Some truly baffling design choices.,1
Positive,"Just here to offset the overreactive gamer rage. Game is fine, feels like an evolution of the original which I enjoyed as well.",1
Positive,"Game owns, and is very literally a re-do of Dragon's Dogma 1 with the intent to adhere closer to that game's original vision that couldn't be realized. Pawns playe smarter, areas are larger, more diverse, and filled with even more secrets, and the combat remains top notch. Everyone still speaks fake olde english too. Performance issues in the main city area do exist and it is valid to criticize them but anyone whining about the MTX can't read, since all of that is earnable ingame in vast quantities with little effort. Just play for an hour or two and you can get all the character edits you want, nerds.",1
Positive,"My initial review after playing the game for 7 hours.The game is fantastic. As a huge fan of the first game, the gameplay has been everything I'd hoped for and more so far.The performance in cities is pretty terrible and the game rightfully deserves flak for it.Hopefully future patches fix it.The mtx in the shop appears to be entirely superfluous. I see no need to ever resort to real money for RC and Wakestones when the game seems to be fairly generous enough as is with those.So while its irksome Capcom keeps doing this in their singleplayer games, in the end don't like it? Don't buy it.Edit:After fully beating the game, I can definitely say the game has major issues.Even with their variants, there's just not enough types of monsters. Everywhere you go its goblins, harpies, saurians, and bandits. Another 2 or 3 small enemy archetypes would have gone a long way to keep things more interesting. Same with large monsters, we really could have used another 3 or 4. The main quest starts off interesting but after what you would *think* is the midpoint, the story just drops off a cliff and hurries you to the end sequence. All the narrative points thus far futile.And the dungeons are lacking. Tons of little caves with at best something you can find in a shop already. There's no long or unique dungeons like the Catacombs, Watergod's Altar, the Shadowfort, etc. I think the game has excellent mechanics and gameplay. its just substantially missing the content it needed.It could have been a 10/10, but as it is it'll be an 8/10 once the performance issues are resolved.",1
Positive,"With 1,300+ reviews, make sure to follow The Cpt Froggy Club Curator Page for plenty more!After more than ten years, the long-awaited sequel of one of the smallest but most beloved Capcom franchises finally arrives and let me tell you, it s incredible that a game like this exists. Dragon s Dogma 2 is an improved version of the first game that takes place in a world four times bigger and introduces a new story that shares some similarities with the previous one. Playing the first game is not required because you will be doing the same stuff here, but it s still fun and recommended if you want to see how it all started and experience a slightly different story that is shaped by your actions.Just like the prequel, you start the adventure by creating your own protagonist through one of the most impressive character editors I have ever seen. You can choose a random, pre-defined character, or create one by modifying each part of the body in great detail. The main choices you will make here will be between human or beastern race (the latter being like the Khajiit from Skyrim), which don t seem to have consequences in-game except for how people refer to you. The other choice is selecting your starting vocation, which defines your combat style and abilities (you will be able to change vocation later). Keep in mind that you won t be able to change appearance until you visit the Barber shop later in the game. You will also need to create your own pawn the same way, an ally that will always accompany you through the journey. Needless to say, I spent nearly two hours checking all the options available in the editor and creating my characters, trying to give them the most realistic look.After finishing with the character editor, you start the game through a classic prologue that presents the story s main theme. You are the Arisen, a person chosen by the Grand Dragon who devours your heart and gives you plenty of authority. What you do with this power is up to you, but you will soon get mixed up with the political intrigues between the two available kingdoms, Vermund and Battahl. Compared to the first game, the story is way better and characters have their own (sometimes optional) plots that characterize them more. The choices you can make during certain important plot moments have long-term consequences for you and the world, including multiple endings.Dragon s Dogma 2 goes against the traditional way of playing games, supported by plenty of info and suggestions. This is a game that, after a short tutorial, stops holding your hand and lets you explore the world at your own pace. The map you have is entirely unexplored and you gradually unveil it as you walk through every corner of the world. Exploration really requires your full attention, asking you to look out for details in the landscape, to find unseen paths that may lead you to a treasure chest or hidden locations, such as caves or abandoned outposts, and rewards your curiosity with new quests and unique items. Fast travelling is very limited and requires using some rare ferrystones, so most of the time you will walk through the same roads or you will ride oxcarts that only move through pre-defined locations and are vulnerable to enemy ambushes.The quest design is something really unique. As someone who loved Elden Ring s subtle ways of doing quests, this is something I m always excited to see in new games. No check lists, no on-screen suggestions, no info on what reward you will get by completing a quest. There are also some time-sensitive quests that once accepted give you limited time for completion, so accepting many of them can easily make you fail some due to the lack of time. Some side quests will also disappear if you continue through the main quest, so the best approach is to explore everything you can before moving forward with the main story. There are often multiple ways for completing a quest and they have consequences for the characters involved. Quest givers aren t marked on the map, so you need to look for NPCs who stand out from the crowd and talk to everyone multiple times because some quests only become available with the passage of time (in-game days) or after completing certain quests.Combat is brutal. You have a health and stamina bar, but each action like attacking, using abilities, sprinting or jumping consumes the latter. Enemies feel like a real threat, especially at the beginning when you are weak but need to face giant monsters like cyclopes, ogres and griffins, which you can even climb and attack, like in Shadow of the Colossus. Compared to the first game, the bestiary is expanded but not as much as I hoped, considering the map is bigger. Too often you will fight against the same group of bandits, goblins, wolves or harpies, which later in the game become more annoying than challenging.Pawns are another important gameplay element. In addition to your own trustworthy pawn, you can add two more to your party. You can recruit them from other players online and likewise other players can hire your pawn in their own worlds. There are multiple incentives for doing so, because pawns constantly learn from experience. If they have discovered a treasure chest, finished a quest or defeated a dangerous monster, they will be able to give you suggestions when you face the same situation. They can even ask you to follow them and show you how to complete a certain quest, which helps those who might feel frustrated by the general lack of info. The pawn s AI is surprisingly good and quickly adapts to the combat conditions. They are able to assist you in many ways, jumping on enemies, grabbing them and even using traps or other objects found in the environment. Pawns can also get sick with the Dragonsplague, a contagious disease that, if not cured, can have disastrous consequences for all living NPCs.Graphically speaking, Dragon s Dogma 2 is the first open world that runs on the RE Engine and it s simply gorgeous. Thanks to photogrammetry, characters appear more photo-realistic and even the environment textures and global illumination are impressive. Unfortunately, the game includes Denuvo Anti-tamper and the performance isn t really great. The problem arises mainly when moving through the big cities where the frame rate drops drastically to the lower 20s, which isn t acceptable.As for micro-transactions, there aren t really any. Yes, you have a list of purchasable DLCs from the Steam store, but it was the same for RE4 Remake and Monster Hunter, yet nobody panicked. The most important thing is that these items are really optional and can all be obtained in-game without too much effort. Just to be clear, there is no in-game shop and no advertising banners, this is not Diablo IV. Dragon s Dogma 2 is everything you would expect from an old-fashioned action RPG that wins against the genre s modern conventions. A magnificent sequel set in a highly interactive fantasy world where anything can happen. You would be doing yourself a disservice if you didn't play it.Key provided by the developer/publisher for review purposes. Any opinions expressed are entirely my own.

Positive,"The optimization is absolute trash. I get constant framerate dips in the city on my beefy rig. The micro transactions are absolutely stupid, predatory, and unnecessary . The PC port needed another week or two to cook in the oven at least. Luckily my experience hasn't been as bad as many other players. The executives at Capcom who were involved with this game should be ashamed. However with all that being said; this game is so much fun to play. I have spent five hours walking around in circles, finding new things, and having absolutely BONKERS enemy encounters. You really FEEL like you are on an epic quest. Some of the best combat in any open world game. I've had so much fun in these first few hours. If you are worried about performance, or have a low tolerance for bad optimization, don't get this game. If you have a good tolerance, and feel like your PC will run it well enough, I highly recommend this game. This does not excuse the bad optimization, and the game just not running for some people. When I saw that MoistCritical couldn't get the game to run I shed a tear. LET CHARLIE AND THE OTHERS INTO THE CURRENT AGAIN!",1
Positive,"A game that I never imaged would ever get a sequel, much less actually released. Everything from the 1st one amped up to 11. The world is massive, combat is the best in the ARPG genre, and the AI of the pawns creates a Single Player game that ends up feeling like a Multiplayer game. There's an entire database of every single unique NPC, that fills out as you meet them, all /w real schedules and potentially affected or interactable, in some way, via gameplay. Monsters and battles can migrate into cities, entire populations, of uniquely crafted NPC's can be wiped out. .and there's a good chance they will if you aren't paying close attention to certain ""allies.""The game doesn't hold your hand, expect to fail. then proceed to work past your failures.""a fantasy world simulator"" -Hideaki Itsuno",1
Positive,"Great game hindered by poor performance on anything other than top-end hardware. I'm addicted despite the 40-50 fps in the open areas and 20-30 max in towns with (3080 and ryzen 5900). The microtransactions are near-useless, only there for people who want to cheat themselves out of a great single player experience, and not shoved in your face at all when you are actually playing the game.",1

Positive,"This game can be described in two parts:1. The game itself is good and fun.2. MTX and performance are shit.Overall I'd give it a 7/10, taking into account that I don't give a damn about MTX and performance is somewhat acceptable on my end. Yeah, sure, frames drop to 45-50 in towns, but it's manageable and doesn't completely ruin the experience.",1
Positive,"Pros:+quite beautiful at times+the best feeling action combat since the first game+wide variety of vocations to mix and match, and no real drawback for doing so+warrior has more skillz!+aught to be found all over the place+Pawns have so much more personality now+it's more dragon's dogma+the adorable cooking clip+cool health restoration/camping system+heaps of neat quests to find by just exploring or backtracking+awesome character creator (head 23 is the only ezpz to make hottie tho)+fun physics stuff, like knocking a cyclops over and using him as a bridgeCons-streamlined armour so you can't mix & match-pawn voices are tied to inclination, and the only nice voice is the weakest type for fighty pawns-the story feels a little truncated in places-only a couple of those delightful cooking clips (no fish or other stuff)-gear progression is a bit too linear-not many new enemies-limited stash, and clunky access to it (holdover from 1)-limited pawn rating system, and inclination system, and you can't gift from your stash-arrow types as skills. Come on capcom, just have the one special arrow skill and let us cycle arrows!-the music isn't as memorableClarification on stuff others are losing the plot over:~microtransactions are totally ignorable, and are the same as they were all the way back in dd1. mtx suck in general, but the hate is a little overblown. DD2 didn't invent them, and nor are they necessary in the slightest.~performance. (My PC is: i5-13400F, RTX3060 Ti, 32GB ram, big SSD. crappo 60hz 1920x1200 monitor) I get a solid 60 fps on medium-high settings, with some stuff cranked to the max. I don't use raytracing, nor any of the frame gen stuff. I occasionally get little 10fps dips in vermund and bakhbattal, but for the most part, I don't push the graphics beyond the limits of my rig and so I never really have issues. It looks nice, but maybe could look nicer. ~length of the game. I've not even completely finished it. I've just been exploring stuff, and even then, I've not gone into every cave. It's huge, and it will take as long to beat as you want it to. Maybe the ending sucks, I dunno. But it sure isn't short unless you're a speed runner. In which case, what game isn't?All in all, if you loved one, there are some steps forwards, and some steps back, but you'll probably love this too.",1
Positive,"The game is delivering what it advertises, there's 0 lies, the content is there. I've seen worse in terms of optimization, idk how people manage to have such low frames because I got 60-70fps average on low/mid graphics with my old 1070ti/i7 4790k combo. DD1 had the same shop, you can buy rift crystals and guess what, they're useless, same for the rest of the ""microtransactions"", these are just items that you can already obtain in game from merchants or by just playing and you'll always find a plethora of these anyway.At no moment this online shop will bother you, same as it never bothered me with DD1. It is totally forgettable (but not defendable, it's just useless in my opinion, how much of a r*tard you have to be to buy rift crystals or harpy baits).DMC5 got even worse microtransactions and funnily you don't hear people complain.""It's too similar to Dragon's Dogma 1"" No shit, you were not expecting a dragon maybe? DD1 was unfinished and DD2 is what DD1 should've been. Vets know that. Only one save is debatable but it's a feature, you're supposed to get attached to your adventure and not start ten characters just to finish only one I guess. And there's always NG+No FOV slider isn't that big of a deal because it's large enough already but i'm sure it can easily be tweaked in the game files.That was for the defense of the game because damn people are unhinged, come on, it's not Starfield or OW2 ffs. You haven't been lied to and Capcom didn't do anything particularly customer-hostile.It's beautiful, spectacular, kino, characters and dialogues are cringey, gameplay is fire and the soundtrack is a masterpiece, just like Dragon's Dogma 1 but bigger and better.I don't know much about Denuvo but from what I've heard, f*ck this, we don't need this filthy parasite on a solo game especially if is eats performance.I agree that the game should run better, needs to be better optimized.I'll have to play it more to see about the crashes people are reporting but so far and from what I've seen it performs as advertised, Capcom didn't lie, it's a banger. Unlike Larian with Divinity and BG3 on which I had to leave negative reviews because I can't stand devs that lie about their overhyped games.",1
Positive,"This game will probably never go above 'Mixed' reviews, to be honest - partly because of uninformed people complaining about microtransactions, partly because of people complaining more rightfully about the performance issues, and partly because of people that as far as I can tell just lack the fundamental sense of curiosity and wonder that's required to enjoy games like this series.A lot of people will blow through every quest in this game by taking the path of least resistance and hurrying towards wherever their minimap tells them to go, never considering that there might be more to any given task than they realize and only caring about the people involved if they get to kill something along the way. A lot of people will be disappointed that much like the first game, the New Game+ is more intended to let you try out vocations you didn't do the first time and experiment with different quest outcomes instead of providing an endlessly harder grind like some games do. A lot of people will overlook things and blame the game for the consequences, groan about the fast travel system, and mistake everything that makes the game so unique for an oversight that should have been fixed. If you're looking for a normal game that will drag you along through setpieces and ask for nothing more than your participation, there's nothing wrong with that, but this isn't that kind of game.If you're looking for something different, though, maybe you'll get as totally absorbed into this as I did. This is the kind of game for people who get intrigued by the implications of each major town having its own full-sized and functional morgue, love finishing quests without the certainty that even their most thorough efforts might have uncovered everything they could have, and just generally appreciate the creative ideas that this game is full of. It's a game where going out on long hikes deep into the wilderness feels like a journey, being out at night feels genuinely perilous, every potential campsite comes as a welcome relief, and at the end of it all your party trudges back to an inn feeling satisfied but exhausted in a way very few games offer. The world is small enough to feel hand-crafted and fun to explore, but big enough that it can take a lot of time and effort to find all of the secrets it has tucked away. Don't even get me started on the pawns, which are even more charming and funny than they were the first go around.And I could practically write an entire second review about the combat. Even the basic vocations each have something in their skillset you've probably never seen in a game like this before, and the physics-driven appeal of being able to throw and weaponize pretty much anything (even your own allies), hurl enemies off cliffs, or bat them around with a giant hammer never really gets old. Then you find the player-only vocations, each more comically unique than the last (sometimes maybe a little too much, in the case of the trickster), and realize you weren't even scratching the surface of it all.Despite all the glowing praise I could lavish onto this game, though, I do agree with some of the common complaints. The obvious weak link is the main quest line, which has a solid first and third act but the second act is almost missing entirely. The middle of the plot just kind of flounders around for a few quests that explain very little, and then comes back together in a way where you just have to take its word for it and move on to enjoy the rest. And while its opening act is where I would consider it at its strongest, several of the quests undermine themselves by having an emphasis on stealth and infiltration in a game that almost totally lacks a stealth system. There are a lot of quests that ask you to sneak into a palace at night to talk to someone, for example - and it's clearly supposed to be an ordeal, because even aside from the warnings about being caught and deceptively tense stealth music there are lots of ways to more covertly infiltrate it, like wearing the guards' armor to disguise as one of them or finding one of many more secretive entrances to the palace. You don't have to know any of this, though, because once you're inside the guards really couldn't care less about your presence, and you can even stop and chat with them while carrying escaped prisoners from jail if you'd like. What could be an exciting bit of espionage ends up feeling bizarrely simple and overshadowed by nearly every other part of the game as a result, and I can't help but feel like maybe they just ran out of budget before they were finished, much like the first game.Even despite its problems, though, and despite the odd performance quirks that prevent pretty much anyone from getting above ~30 fps in the main city (though most people will at least get more than 20! Hang in there!), this is the kind of game that scratched all of my itches, checked every box, and left me wanting more even 100 hours later. In a world effectively living in Baldur's Gate 3's shadow for the indefinite future DD2 still manages to stand out by the merits of its own originality, and as far as I'm concerned it's a worthy successor to the original in nearly every way. I think its $70 price tag begs a little more completeness in regards to the main storyline, but in every other regard it earns the premium price tag in my book.",1
Positive,"First things first. In my experience, the performance issues on PC are often exaggerated. If you have a decent PC and not a potato, most games criticized for poor performance on PC in the past several years are actually not at all bad, rarely going below 60 fps on a mid rig I have. Not this time. This time what you hear about terrible performance is completely true. The game struggles to keep above 30 fps. It falls all the way down to 20-25 in Vermund (The big city), which makes it very uncomfortable to explore.In the overworld, the game mostly sticks around 50-60 fps, sometimes rising to 80. But the FPS dip happens again during pretty much every combat encounter, all the way to 35-45 fps, even with the effects set to Low.DLSS looks especially ugly in this game, and does not help at all. None of the graphics settings actually seem to have any impact on performance whatsoever. The FPS stay pretty much the same regardless of whether the settings are set to low or to high. This is important. If you are a person who doesn't really care about graphics much and are ready to set everything to low, this will not help you here. You will get the same terrible performance everyone else gets.The issue is exacerbated by my high refresh rate screen (165 Hz), making 30 fps not only slow, but also extremely juddery. So even if you don't mind playing at 30 fps, keep in mind that it might still feel uncomfortable if you have a high refresh rate monitor.For that alone, I would not recommend buying the game now, at the time of this review publication, until these issues are fixed.The second important issue is microtransactions. While I do understand the overall concern and even agree with it that letting devs (or in majority of cases publishers) add microtransactions into premium games without a backlash implies expressing consent for such a thing and can potentially lead the premium games industry to incorporate f2p mobile gaming dark patterns in the future - I believe in this particular game these microtransactions are a non-issue. All the items you can purchase through microtransactions you can get in the very beginning of the game for in-game currency if you want to. So whatever you can buy for real money in this game has no impact on your experience aside from, maybe, giving you an additional edge at the very beginning.That said, these problems, while important and potentially deal breakers for some, are circumstantial things that I hope are going to be fixed in the near future and have nothing to do with the actual quality of the game, its gameplay and content. The game itself is a blast. Being a person who absolutely hates playing games at sub-60 fps, even I was immersed to a degree where I simply stopped caring about it most of the time because I was too busy enjoying myself.I played the original Dragon's Dogma years ago and tried to start over recently, but I never felt like I wanted to actually finish. I think the most I've played the original game was about 15-20 hours before dropping. I did enjoy the gameplay and combat, but the overall feeling I got from the original was, mostly, boredom. Dragon's Dogma 2, while not making any fundamental changes to the first game's formula (in my opinion), manages to fix most of the issues I had with the original by simply executing things better.The enemy variety is still pretty lackluster, but now enemies have more ""presence"", turning from a trivial obstacle to actual threat that forces you to make choices about who you engage, why and when, because you have limited resources and ""get tired"" more easily.The overwhelming majority of quests are still uninspired fetch quests with no interesting stories attached to them, but in this game it is the NPCs who approach you, not the other way around. The impact it has on your perception of these quests is surprisingly big. Suddenly it really does feel like you're helping people who need help instead of just collecting question marks across the map. Making it enjoyable instead of a chore.You still have to spend a lot of time managing your inventory. I'd even say that in DD2 the inventory management became even more necessarily involved, since you have way less carrying capacity. But, strangely enough, because of other small changes made to the core systems, it does feel somewhat right, making you feel a little bit like you're playing a survival game where you need to pay attention to what you have and, again, make choices about what to bring with you when you set out beyond the city gates. The inventory management, while more demanding in DD2, also feels much more meaningful and therefore less like an obnoxious chore. The overworld is interesting to explore, because it actually feels like a hostile environment that can get you killed, which forces you to plan your routes across it and prioritize where you go, making it very hard to sweep the entire map right away. At least that is my experience so far. It might change when my character gets more powerful, but so far the balance of challenge feels quite right to me to evoke the feeling of actual adventure. Unlike DD1 where the overworld is simply just a space you need to traverse in order to get from point A to point B. The only thing I am not decided on is combat. It feels good enough and is engaging, especially against big monsters like Cyclops and Griffins, but there's an issue I can't quite overlook. The combat feels very floaty. Your hits don't have the necessary impact. Slashing up enemies feels like cutting butter. And. the ragdoll physics. They give me the same feeling as Yakuza Kiwami 2 compared to Yakuza Kiwami 1 (if it tells you anything at all). From what I see, I assume that the devs decided to rely on physics engine compared to baked animations when it comes to movement and combat way more in this game compared to DD1. And oftentimes it feels very clunky. For example, playing as a fighter, when you used Shield Bash skill or Blinking Strike skill, in DD1 enemies got thrown away to what feels like a fixed distance every time. And once they landed, they stayed in place, which made it more comfortable to use these abilities because you had control over them. In DD2, using the same skills, you never know how far the enemy will fly away and for how much farther they will roll across the ground after landing, making these skills very unreliable because you have so much less control over them. Playing as a Thief, I gave up on using the first skill you get (I forgot its name, the one that makes you whirl across the arena between enemies), because it is so difficult to control what enemy you will hit and where you actually end up. The same can be said about thief's dodge. It feels like you have very little control over the distance you travel with it.The solution for me was starting to perceive the combat's clunkiness in the same way I perceive inventory management and traversal of the openworld here. Maybe it does feel clunky on purpose in order to better sell the idea of the overworld being more threatening. You need to rely on your wits more than on skills and weapons, because things can go wrong at any time in a way you don't expect, so you need to be on your guard and ready to improvise. If that's what the developers were going for, they did a good job. But again, when compared to DD1 crisp and highly controllable movements, the combat in DD2 feels completely different and much more uncomfortable. Overall, provided the performance issues will be solved in the immediate future, I would definitely recommend this game for purchase after the issues are solved.",1
Positive,F*** the frame drops F*** the micro-transactions.Beyond that. don't let the reviews scare you. This game is incredible. The rewarding exploration has given me a feeling I haven't had since Elden Ring. 30 hours in I don't want to put it down but sleep is needed. I have 2080ti/i9 and I have got it to a playable framerate thankfully. More performance patches will be appreciated.Will update after beating game. Might be my GOTY.,1
Positive,"Changing my review after 20 hrs in.If you dont mind spending 70$ - game is good. Microtransactions are dumb and seems like they just count on ppl to throw them money, since you just dont need them. At all. 20 hrs in and I didnt need anything from the ""DLCs"" a single time. Quest design is clunky and buggy. Exploring - awesome. Having actual blast with the game. BUT!If you dont have a good enough setup, you short on budget atm or you dont like buggy games and prefer to play completed version of the game - wait. Till fixes, patches and. Discount. Still dont think that this game worth 70$ they ask for it. But I'm having fun, thats all that metters by the end of the day. Yeah, its not even close as good as BG3 or Elden Ring. But its good enough. So ""mixed"" I'd say is fair. Game it self is very fun, but performance, micros and base price makes ""mixed"" fair. After all - tbf I'd wait till they fix performance on PC and some sale. But if you're hyped to play new game - go for it. Just be ready for some issues during the way lol P.S. if you play mouse/keyboard archer gameplay is just a joke, but thanks god you can respec pretty easy and really early in the game.",1
Positive,"Part of me doesn't want to leave a positive review, I support the rest of the players who add their complaints to the pile, hoping it will send some kind of message to Capcom. No, I don't support them but it is, sadly, the garbage that is expected nowadays from triple A companies. In this particular case, all of the items are easily obtainable within the game, and when I say easily, I mean it. Which begs the question of whether it's really worth it for these fucking shitty companies to fulminate the goodwill of their fans for this meaningless garbage. The rest of the complaints about Denuvo or performance issues are justified, while I haven't personally encountered any problems, it doesn't seem excusable that this game requires top end hardware to run properly.The thing is, when it comes to the game, it is worth it, looks great, plays great. If you're on the fence, liked the first one and think your pc can run it, you should try it.",1
Positive,Drop kicked by an Orge off a cliff into a group of goblins.Wild night.,1
Positive,"The game is really good after spending some time to learn all the systems and game play / control setup (KB&M)was a bit frustrating at first). It's just what i was waiting for, open, expansive, plenty of things to find while exploring. I am playing on an older p.c with a 1080-ti and have most setting on high with shadows on medium and have had decent performance with some slow downs in the city. While i am against the micro-transactions at least they are all available to find in game also, still should have taken one from the Larian play book for the W.",1
Positive,"To preface, I have a 13900k, 3080ti, 32gb ram, and an nvme drive. The game, in general, runs perfectly fine for me. I see some small dips in the two major cities, but not unplayable, probably mid 40 fps on max settings, 1440p. In open world/combat, I get 75-120fps on max, 1440p. So, my review is from a standpoint of someone who accepts the performance isn't great on others machines, but is fine on mine.The game is great. If you liked DD1, you'll probably love DD2. If you didn't like DD1, you likely won't enjoy DD2. It's as simple as that.A lot of people are going into it expecting Skyrim, Baldurs Gate, Monster Hunter, or Witcher, and it's none of those. In a lot of ways, it plays like a single player MMORPG. The classes are all fun and unique, the party system and mechanics are great, combat is excellent. The story this time around is more in your face than the first game.About the MTX - I completely ignore them. Every Capcom game has this same crap, and it can safely be ignored. It's basically a nothing-burger to complain about, since they are more or less there for Capcom to tell shareholders it has MTX, and if you buy them, you're just a fool.All in all, I love the game so far, and hope they can get the performance together so others can love it, too.",1
Positive,"There are problems with the game currently that are causing a lot of the negative reviews like the bad performance and having only a single save that very valid and has made Capcom aware of the issues.The microtransactions are utterly pointless garbage that have no place in the game and won't even have any effect on your playthrough as you get all the important things from playing normally, doing quests, and exploring.The game is genuinely really fun and I highly recommend it but you should decide for yourself if you'll be able to enjoy the game despite the current problems or wait for it to get fixed but at the very least don't believe there is any "" pay to win "" or "" pay to fast travel "", it's just stupid microtransactions, that have lead to some misinformation, that shouldn't be here in the first place and I assure you I haven't reached a single point where it's felt like the game was even designed around needing to spend extra real money",1
Positive,"This is a game you'll enjoy if you really loved Dragon's Dogma 1 as it's pretty much the same just with updated graphics and a few new gameplay mechanics such as the oxcart system. I'm a bit disappointed that it didn't have more new things (more bosses, more enemy variety, better story etc) but I still really enjoyed my time playing it. The pawn system is still one of the greatest systems made (basically single player coop) and I wish it was in more games. So while the game is not as great as I had hoped, it is still very good. I've just finished 100% of the achievements while doing 1 full run and a partial run on NG+. I hope the future expansion works on adding more content to the game.",1
Positive,"Sure this game has it's performance issues but overall with the little bit that I have played so far this is a phenomenal game. If you are interested in playing this game and have a low end PC, do wait for a performance patch of some sorts and then consider buying this!",1
Positive,"It's pretty much everything I wanted from a Dragon's Dogma 2. More vocations, bigger world, better visuals, but also a lot of the same systems and quirks that made the original quite charming. ""Wolves hunt in packs Arisen!""Performance issues for myself have not been terrible, just minor drops to 50 - 45 FPS in capital city, otherwise it's maintaining 60 (which I have it locked at) everywhere else with max settings and RT on, etc. Now this is WITH a 4090 and 13900k sooooo, the fact that's dipping to 45ish on this setup is certainly not ideal.The microtransaction drama is made up reddit drama. Everyone knows Capcom sells ""shortcuts"" as ""DLC"", they did in DD1, they did it Monster Hunter, they're doing it here. You don't need any of it.My only real complaint aside from the performance issues is that, currently, you cannot just ""start a new game"". It's limited to one save slot like DD1 but there simply is no ""New Game"" option which does feel like a very, very weird choice and Capcom has already announced they're considering changing that. If you want to start over like a new player, with nothing, you should be allowed to without having to delete cloud saves, delete local saves, etc. Otherwise it maintains the same feel that I loved from the first game. No fast travel, dynamic combat, and tons of enemies means every adventure, even to a nearby town, can be dangerous and exciting. And should night fall, it's got that same dangerous atmosphere, the kind that makes you jump a mile when a Chimera jumps out of the pitch black at you.One important point that even I didn't know going in; this isn't a ""sequel"" to the story in DD1, it's more of a parallel universe/retelling. So expect a lot of deja vu with locations and storylines early on. I don't really see this as a bad thing but if you are expecting a continuation of the story, you may be disappointed by that.",1
Positive,"Seeing some of the unfounded reviews, I had to post my review now, instead of after 30+ hours in the game. You do not need real money to change your appearance you can use in game currency (RC ) to do it. You get enough in game currency to buy what you need to progress in your adventure. The micro transaction shop is more of convenience store. As for performance I'm running it with Ray Tracing on a RTX 3080 and have not had any issues, with 60 FPS even in towns, some occasional drop in FPS but nothing game breaking at all around 50-45 minimum in some places but for a very brief moment, does not stutter or affects game play. For some who have better cards and have issues, I would suggest them to look into their settings. Tweaking some of the settings could help. Also the game starts with a default resolution that was not my resolution, so I would also suggest you check the in game settings and reset the resolution to yours. Once i did that everything looked as intended.The game is gorgeous and the combat is a blast. Imagine Baldur's Gate 3 or any game of that genre's set up, with your pawns but in a 3D open world, that's exactly what this game feels like.The story is entertaining and well crafted with some epic cut scenes. All in all keeps you wanting more.The questing system feels easy and suggestive rather than forced on you.The prologue could have been probably been improved on, feels a bit too similar to DD1 except for the Hydra, that was a nice change, but it does the job of teaching you the first basics of the game.Do I recommend this game, yes based on my experience. So far it's been real fun.",1
Positive,Dragons Dogma Online 2015 was better optimized than this.,1
Positive,"I finished the game today - Friday - (True Ending + Max Pawn Affinity).Firstly I have to point out that I had to apply quite some fixes for it to be playable in the first place for me, such as:1.Uniscaler FSR 3.0 & FrameGen Mod by LukeFZ => to achieve above sub-30 frames (a nice 70-91 fps average)(due to the wide CPU utilisation issues the game has, changing graphical settings does very little to frame rate).2.Applied a registry patch to always have the game start as ""High-Priority"" which I had since I first started playing (popular fix). May be one of the reasons I never experienced any stuttering in the game whatsoever and I do also have it installed on a separate nvme SSD, however the game does run like a pile of garbage if you tend to play it out of the box so no denying that.3.Needed a mod to have actual control over the UI functions, funnily enough there's options for ""Auto"" under HUD elements (which you would imagine would hide said UI bits when not needed) but simply doesn't do anything different from ""On"" except for if you go AFK for a long while it hides the UI.Hurray!4.Had to get a mod for ""infinite stamina outside of combat"". You're literally the most out of shape character imaginable no matter your carry weight, so no wonder it would make the world feel so enormous, since you are taking breaks every ~7 seconds after sprinting.5.Mod for showing NPC/Pawn affinity as there's literally no way to tell what's the state for anyone you meet in the game (Would think at the very least that they would act different, but a person with +150 affinity might as well treat you the same as -50).Literally only time it starts to show is when you've just about reached affinity cap which takes FOREVER.Anyways fixes aside I applied the bare-minimum to be able to actually enjoy the game somewhat vanilla.I should state too that I never played the original game, so I can't quite relate to the reviews mentioning the first game.Going to start with the positive:1.Game feels low-key ""clunky"" especially in combat, but in a weird good way.2.The world is very intriguing and something with purpose seems to lurk around pretty much every corner of the map.3.Really like just roaming/exploring the map and stumbling into unique NPC/Pawns and random events.4.A lot of choices for creating and building your main character (Arisen) and your main Pawn, (that strangers/friends can hire to their play-through) which they can stumble upon in the wilds too or through the hubs.5.Can also reward people through their pawn by giving them gifts directly and or when they are dismissed back to their master,people can also be awarded for helping others Pawns do set tasks such as ""kill a cyclopes"" and or ""Give Griffin Claw"" which in turn will have a gift set by their own master for the Arisen that helps said Pawn.6.Fun ways to deal with enemies, whet-ever you prefer to throw them around the field and or off a cliff is up to you,climbing enemies and fighting them that way really did give me good vibes of Monster Hunter World which was a ton of fun too.As for the negatives:1.The story felt quite a bit rushed, especially in the later bits where a lot of plots/characters takes place, they seemed to have been left out all the sudden and or ended abruptly, almost like they were told to wrap things up and finish it there and then.2.All classes are just super strong, especially Sorcerer & Magick Archer which after their very first upgrade just melts everything and anything in their way (most projectile attacks are auto lock-on too).The only reason that you would ever switch to another Vocation is to either try it out or just quickly level it up to get the best perks from it for your main class and never touch it again, there's literally no reason to.3.Performance (severe CPU utilisation issues - CPU bound 90% of the time which may plummet frame rates randomly, if not consistently).4.There are cases where you may potentially and unaware so kill off entire quest-lines without knowing, consequences that locks you out of them entirely too.5.There are NO consequences to stealing, literally can just dash into houses and steal everything while they watch you do it.I don't know if this is some type of lore bit that I am missing out on, but it just seems dull and quite boring to have zero reactions.6.Having the option to ""Save"" in the menu but the game auto saves almost every corner/interaction you take,only control you have over is the Save for whenever you sleep at an Inn or in your own house (There are two types of saves in the game, rest at an Inn/House which are actual manual saves and then there is normal saves that occurres automatically too, which are insanely frequent).Game is honestly fun to play but feels like a lot was left out, the price tag is steep too especially for the state the game is in(I myself picked it up for 50% off with the Deluxe Edition).p.sEverything from the Deluxe Edition (this includes for all the other DLCs too but one) except for ""Dragon's Dogma Music & Sound Collection - Custom Sounds"" rest can be earned in-game, fairly quickly too.So my advice would be to pick up the base game whenever, preferably on a decent discount.Pick up the DLC mentioned above which actually adds something worthwhile to the game(toggle On/Off track/sound replacements etc to the game from the original Dragon's Dogma through the game settings).I did however enjoy the game a lot still, really hope they'll sort out the terrible performance though.I recommend it since it was actually playable for me, got it on a hefty discount too.",1
Positive,"kino, fuck the haters and poorfags, those are the only ppl who don't like the game",1
Positive,"Runs pretty badly, but seems genuinely fun. I'll give them a couple weeks. The systems and vibes are where they need to be.",1
Positive,"Dragons Dogma 2!Thus far, it is Dragons Dogma! Just the second game in the series.It doesn't go crazy innovating and is just more of ehat we had but it looks better and is a little different!My one and only complaint is that I can't play as magic knight anymore, which was my main in DD1.This review is mostly just to offset all the people whining about the micro transactions that don't even matter. I've seen review bombing before, but this has by far been for the worst reason and this game deserves better.Performance isn't great all the time but my pc runs it fine and only has crashed once. So, if your complaint is about anything but the micro transactions then I'll say its a valid one.This is not the first or last single player game to include microtransaction, and the stuff you gain here doesn't even give you a real leg up in the game and are not necessary to play and have fun at all whatsoever.",1
Positive,"Fantasy Immersive sim 2: Electric BoogalooYea it sucks that Capcom is anti consumer. (They always have been)Performance is mega ass but I'm sure it will get better with updates like always. (Modern AAA Gaming)The game is fun, combat is great even at low framerates. lmaoI don't give a fuck about the story, combat is what I only cared about and it's great.It's Dragon's Dogma 1 but more so if that's what you wanted then this is a buy, just have to deal with modern gaming travesties. All in all, Capcom can eat the fattest part of my ASS.Hideaki Itsuno (and his team) is Tha Mutha Fuckin GOAT!",1
Positive,"The game is great so far, but the crashes and performance in towns is roough. Overall im loving it, and thankfully the game seems to be good as a game itself, so hopefully the issues can be fixed. The microtransactions are dumb, but you can literally buy all of them ingame with gold, like the character changer and all that, so its just dumb. They did this with the first game, however, so heres hoping they get rid of that garbage in this one too.The only thing id say (outside of shit optimization) that is truly awful, is the fact you cant make a new save. DD1 only had one save, but you could make a new character to overwrite your old one whenever. I genuinely see no reason as to why that couldnt be the case in this game.",1
Positive,"I wish there was a way to describe my recommendation beyond yes or no because the game was great for me for the longest time. Initial verdict is great gameplay but wait for it to be on sale because it has some other big issues for single player story fanatics. Fun gameplay with the vocations, I didn't play sorcerer, mystic, rouge, and magic archer at time of review. Looks great with some really cool animations (sorry everyone who is struggling to run this) I have an i5-13600KF & Radeon RX 6900XT. Story did not resolve in a good way in my opinion which I will expand upon below. Some performance issues still noted for me at time of review I never had the pawn sickness issue crop up in my gameplay but considering it, as Skaterskunk says in his review This sick pawn will murder the entire town you rest in. Quest givers, friends, vendors. Doesn't matter. Oh, and it's a cutscene. Even though there are some ways around this the fact that this can just happen if you are late in the game and not paying attention is crazy and going to ruin some people. I think the micro-transactions are so inconsequential in this case because everything is easily found in abundance in the game, if you are struggling with camping gear I don't even know how you are playing to have this issue.I think I would honestly divide this game into 2 sections for me. Running around and leveling most of the vocations part 1 and part 2 is the last like 2 hours of gameplay where I accidentally finished the campaign and felt so let down. In part 1 I spent a bit over 40 hours that left me wanting more running around having a good time with the combat system for several Vocations. Learning the quirks of each and getting better at defeating enemies through learning a Vocation or just knowing more about the enemy was great. I know it is not advised to jump around because of how the leveling changes what substats you get each level depending on what Vocation you are but I wanted to try and get all of them maxed for myself just because. Also, don't bother worrying about your characters voice because there is no voiced dialogue for them, maybe just some grunts if you are lucky. Now lets get into the story issues.This is mostly from my memory but lets get into it, start of the game story spoilers are here but that's it. You start out in a prison camp with memory problems not knowing you are the Arisen, not fantastic. Then you get rolled up on by Medusa and after a brief fight you escape, there's a ghost guy who helps out and I'm not sure what that's about. Then you make it to a settlement with a bunch of pawns and are really like ""oh word, I'm the Arisen"" so you start making your way to the city that is ruled by the Arisen but apparently there is a false Arisen ruling it currently. Now lets move into the other spoiler stuff. Note: I know I didn't get all the side quests and probably missed some context but everyone gets a different playthough eh? So lets be generous and say there are like 2 main story beats with essentially side quests under them. In the Arisen city you do like 4 quests to try and get evidence to throw out the false ruler. I couldn't do 1 of them because I couldn't get the masquerade to start and didn't bother looking it up but that didn't end up mattering because I went to confront the false ruler (I think you can do this after like 1 or 2 of the evidence quests) and never made it in the front door because he has spooky crystal that hurt/control my pawns. So we head out to the country that the crystal was made in to learn its secrets. For WHATEVER reason this leads right into a quest line where you are helping to MAKE another crystal that can hurt/control pawns. After doing like 1 actual quest where you go somewhere and meet the ghostly founder of the Arisen ruled land and get a broken sword from him that you can't use but its like the pawn control crystal apparently you then you have to kill a few drakes for the heart crystals to make the sword have the crystals power? Once the sword is whole it jumps essentially right into the final mission out with little indication of you starting the final mission, or at least it felt like it for me. You start following the guy who put together the crystal fake ruler has and your sword you cant use and you get to use the sword you just killed a bunch of Drakes for to. Open a door. and keep following them. As you follow them you do a very mellow dramatic ""fight"" with the Collosus where it is just walking along a path and you have to either climb it and attack a couple weak point or just run in front of it and shoot ballistas at it (these need a pawn at least to be able to turn more than a couple degrees and sometimes they don't want to help, also they get destroyed very quickly even by your own pawns shooting or attacking through it trying to hit the Collosus). There is no health bar so the only indication you have of doing damage or anything is how many weak points it has left. After defeating it you walk into a complex and see the guy you are following go into another area but the bridge collapses so you walk to an elevator that you start with the worthless sword you got then have a 1v1 fight with an NPC that you interact with a couple times but probably won't care about in the slightest. This is on a bridge so you can just stagger him and throw him off the edge, I completed this 1v1 in maybe 10 seconds. Then you see the false ruler is also there with crystal guy with some pawns and other people. Crystal guy is trying to summon the dragon and wants to control the dragon to stop the cycle and remake the world but this was quite literally the first time I had heard about this from this guy, I might have missed it but it felt so random. He summons a messed up drake that has boils on it and starts spouting generic bad guy lines then the real dragon drops in and deletes the drake. Crystal guy fell over and says some bad line before dying and the false ruler who I was fighting before this cutscene (I didn't even finish that fight there were a lot of enemies still up) is nowhere to be seen and the dragon starts talking to me. Bro pulls out some NPC that I maxed friendship with by doing like 2 quests for out of NOWHERE and says either fight me or walk away and I kill this guy. I didn't want to delete the NPC so I was like alright guess I'm finishing this game right now so I start the fight with the dragon. This fight was honestly too easy for me probably for a couple reasons. Before this little quest line I started on leveling the Mage Vocation and just got it to the complete support build I wanted at maybe level 6/10, no attacks in the bank but character level 52 maybe and some good gear. I was running archer and double warrior pawns. The whole fight I stood right under the dragon and popped heals and shields for maybe like 5 min before the fight was over. It felt easier than the fights with Drakes in open world because their spells are so much stronger. After that the game is over and rolls cutscene of you returning to be the ruler of Arisen-land. After you roll credits you return to title with options to NewGame+ essentially or load last save/last inn save. I was in shock the game was over so I clicked NewGame+ and it threw up so many warnings about how it was going to overwrite my save I backed out and tried load last save which put me right BACK INTO THE ROLL CREDITS CUTSCENE. I don't remember the last time I used an Inn so I wasn't going to do that and this lead to me making this review. I put recommend because the gameplay is fun enough that I think grabbing on sale will be good enough for everyone.",1
Positive,"Ok I've finished character creator, time to see what all the fuss is about.",1
Positive,"I spent nearly 5 hours customizing my character lol (had to repeat twice since I pressed the back button accidentally and my progress wasn't saved).After the character creation (5 hrs), I played the game for another hour or two and I honestly enjoyed the gameplay the same way I love Baldur's Gate 3 (but BG3 will always have a special place in my heart). BG3 > DD2.Unfortunately, a few hours in and there are a lot of negative reviews about this game already, not mainly for the gameplay but for the optimization and performance issues (and a few microtransactions). There seems to be a disconnect between developer vision and publisher greed.On my end, however, there were no hiccups or stutters on performance. I only have a 3060 with 6GB VRAM but almost everything runs buttery smooth, so far. Don't let the negative reviews easily sway or discourage you.Only get this game if you love open-world RPG games AND if your rig can handle the demanding system requirements to run this game. A lot of people are whining about performance but usually fall short of this. Also, if you have enough disposable income to not regret or whine if there's at least one thing about the game you'll feel upset about.TL;DR: Gameplay good. Performance and optimization bad. Unreasonable microtransactions (it's a relief that I got the deluxe edition for some useful freebies and kits that I don't have to buy separately). Here's to hoping for better optimization. No regrets but other people's frustrations are understandable.",1
Positive,impressively fun open world,1
Positive,"This is a great sequel to the previous game and I recommend it (If you don't mind the shoddy performance). If you're new to the franchise then I highly recommend you wait for patches and/or a sale. Is it worth $70? I don't think even the best games are worth $70, but as someone who really wanted to play this game, I don't regret paying for it.If you liked Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen then you'll almost certainly like this game. Bigger world, combat is still very good, pawn AI while still wonky at times, is much better than in the previous game. Almost everything is better in this game.For new players, the best point of reference I think would be something between Shadow of War and Elden Ring (Minus the punishing difficulty) in terms of how the combat feels. Some of the mobility and speed of Shadow of War meets the combat of Elden Ring. The combat is not slow/clunky like Elden Ring and other souls-likes though. It's fast and fluid.Story isn't captivating. I wouldn't say it's bad, but it doesn't land with me, and I doubt it'll land with a lot of others. You won't see years of lore videos like you do with Elden Ring and such.Soundtrack is decent. No songs stick out to me like they did in Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen.Inventory management isn't the worst thing in the world, but it's not great either. Lots of flicking through menus and checking pawn inventories for items. The designs of dungeons and the map is nothing special at all. Very basic. The charm comes from it being a well-designed medieval fantasy open world. You'll be reasonably rewarded for exploration. You will not encounter a single loading screen outside of cutscenes and fast travel.VERY poorly optimized no matter how good your PC is. On higher end machines it's certainly playable, but it will feel very rough at times, especially in the main city. I can't speak for lower end machines.I recommend installing one of the FSR/DLSS3 frame generation mods off of NexusMods. There's options for those without 40 series GPUs, and ones for people who have them. This will make the game significantly more playable. The microtransactions are not necessary at all. At launch, very many people (Myself included) were under the impression that editing your character was locked behind a paywall. This is NOT the case and you can buy an item in-game to customize your character and pawn.There's really no reason to buy any of the microtransactions, especially the currencies, as you will get everything in-game.I love this game a lot. It's a shame that it's released in the state that it did and with no warning on the (Pointless) microtransactions. This game is an action-RPG with lots of exploration to be had. Don't expect much from the story in my opinion. The absolute most fun will be had running into the open world without much of a plan.If you want a number rating from someone you don't know: 8/10.Switch that to a 9/10 if they ever fix the performance.",1

It's never mentioned, there's no shop, nothing. It won't affect your experience at all, what will is all the shit that props it up, like anti-tamper and other nonsense that powers it.

Positive,"Gameplay is what you expect from Dragon's Dogma 1 and more. Every bit of combat feels impactful. If you play this game with a relaxed view, take it slow and explore anything that catches your interest, you will have a good time. As you would expect from Dragon's Dogma games, it takes a step towards a more classic RPG, and in my opinion I think they did this amazingly well. I cannot emphasize how much fun this game feels when you explore. Multiple Vocations (classes) makes it easy to find a playstyle that you like that you can get the pawns built around to make a fluid team.Microtransaction complaints come from a real place, but you can only buy them once and they're common items you can find in game. I do not endorse the extra transactions, but I cannot say the game itself is bad, just marketing. People mention bad optimization, I have not experienced this myself.",1
Positive,"I am torn on giving this a thumbs up - Had I paid full price this would be an easy down. I don't feel there is a lot of value for the regular price ($94.99 in Canada) I got this at $53I did enjoy playing mostly (the constant goblin attacks annoy some but I am the type to grind and explore). Not a lot of thought was put into the story (to be blunt it's weak af) The battle mechanics of course are fun, graphics good, and no lag or freeze issues at all. (get a controller) Character Creation is well done (make sure to download the Character Creation as well) I 'thought' I did a good job until I seen some the characters other people had created (I also learned the DD community also makes DD characters.take that as you will) You can continue with the same Character but the enemies reset as the original weak enemies. I played the Original Dragons Dogma Dark Arisen and I loved that when you thought you finished the game there was more (and tougher enemies) BB Isle was great as well for tough enemies. I do hope they add a true game+. It also feels like a chunk of the game is missing.future dlc? .

Positive,"(3/23/24) Wow, there is a lot of undeserved outrage going around about this game at the time of this review. Not all undeserved, but a lot of it is. I suspect stomping on the game's reputation became the next trendy thing, probably because it's a AAA title with a AAA pricetag and people naturally want to blast these games.TL;DR: The game is great, but its performance is a serious problem, and if you're new to Dragon's Dogma (i.e. haven't played and loved the original) then you should probably wait for some performance patches.Is Dragon's Dogma 2 worth the price? This is why I wish steam had a 'neutral' option for reviews or at least didn't force you to pick thumbs up and thumbs down. I love the game and believe it is worth the price, but the performance issue is legit and it's hard for me to truly recommend it while it persists. The other issues people enjoy talking about-pay-to-win microtransactions, for example-are unfounded and circulating around 10 times before the reality has a chance to put its shoes on. Capcom has always included these garbage useless add-ons in a lot of their games, I suspect as a mandated requirement of business higher-ups, and they are either purely cosmetic or their contents can be earned extremely easily in-game. Even beloved Monster Hunter has these and people weren't complaining about them much.The ""can't start a new game"" controversy is admittedly true (and hilarious that something like that was overlooked), but it really shouldn't affect the typical player because there's basically no need to restart the game so early. Unlike DD1, there aren't mechanics that can permanently screw up your stats if you choose to go a different build later, you can easily buy vouchers to change your appearance using in-game currency, and switching classes is unlocked extremely early. They're going to fix it, so the amount of people who would actually be detrimentally affected by this is negligibly low while the game is new and few have gotten far.So what of the game itself, if we ignore the performance problem? It's essentially Dragon's Dogma 1 but far more polished with more interesting environments to explore, more mechanics to bring life to the world, and more options to combat. A lot of the systems present in the original are still here but with significant improvements, primarily the pawn party member system. While I've already heard some lines repeat, the pawns are actively helpful and will show you directly to loot they have encountered in other worlds, or where to go for specific quests, as opposed to previously where they simply had one line of dialogue to hint at where you should go if they knew but you didn't. They actually feel useful in combat, which is most important, and the many small interactions you can have with them-from high-fiving after a fight to chilling at camp together-grant them the ""not quite human, but definitely something of their own, and certainly helpful"" aspect far better than the three stooges you brought around in DD1.Combat itself for the player is a blast, of course. Many options to fit your own playstyle, whether you are frontlining to tank aggro and allow your pawns to channel their spells, playing fast and loose with bows or daggers, or setting your party up to tank for you while you channel the spells yourself. You can also use any environmental obstacles like boulders or conveniently-placed explosive barrels to your advantage, and one big plus is that the enemy may very well have access to the exact same skillset you do. As a Fighter, for example, you start the game with a charging strike that lets you close the gap nearly instantly from a long range. But you'd better be prepared for any enemy Fighters or even the better trained goblins with a sword & shield; they will do the exact same to you. They will even use environmental effects too, so be careful about ignoring those explosive barrels nearby because they can and will be thrown at you. While the story makes you out to be someone special lorewise, the gameplay shows you are pretty similar to everyone else in combat, and that's refreshing.But ultimately, the performance issue is bad enough that it actively eats into the enjoyment of the game. I can't reliably surpass 50 FPS when out in the world and fighting monsters, and god forbid I get anywhere above 30 FPS in the main city. My computer isn't top-of-the-line anymore, but I haven't had any performance problem in any recent game close to the degree in this (even Helldivers 2 only dropped to at most 40 FPS and that was due to a bug).So if you're unsure about the purchase, especially with regards to your computer specs, wait a bit and see how it improves after some patches first. But if you played and enjoyed the original, you'll have a great time with this one, even now.",1
Positive,"This game is a fuckin blast! In my last adventure just trying to get from point A to point B for the sake of lifting fog of war off my map. My party. ran into a cyclops that fell down perfectly on a broken bridge and we used his body to get across, where there was another damn cyclops who picked my fuzzy ass up and yeeted me into a wall where I swear my character had a come to Jesus moment. Ran back and did a jumping attack where I was unceremoniously planted into the earth sideways with a sucker punch this thing pulled so far outa left field I forgot who I was. After killing the clops and healing my pride a griffin did its best Gandalf impression on a mountain I was trying to climb where I decided to climb up for a shadow of the colossus style face shanking. SO OBVIOUSLY the griffin decides to FLY THE FUCK AWAY with me on its back like my dumbass said ""Yip Yip"". I am crying inside with how far away I'm getting from the area I wanted to explore when this thing dive bombs a damn bison or buffalo or gruffalo or Mark fuckin Ruffalo. For those of you keeping track, this is the 4th time I kiss the earth so damned hard that this game should have been rated M for mature due to sexual content. My party is lost in the fuckin shadow realm and I'm counting the birds flying around my head as a literal wolf pack grabs me and drags me into a surprisingly pretty area covered in these glowing blue flowers that become TINTED RED WITH MY BLOOD! Luckily pawns are either practice partners with Usain Bolt or they have them old Nike Pumps on, know what I'm sayin? PUMP IT UP! My pawns, otherwise known as my portable Wambulance and company, free me from my slow death by chump chomp. Its getting dark, I look for a campfire I saw while being DRAGGED BY MY JUGULAR! And I see a blue light. Oh cool, an NPC must be fighting someth- WRONG! ITS THE HEADLESS HORSEMAN! BECAUSE OF FUCKIN COURSE IT IS! He's sucks the soul from me . pause. and I die. And now I'm sitting here looking at ""Do you use a wake stone"". And part of me is like, ""Well that was a hell of a journey, would be a shame to start from the last auto save, might not have been that far back"" And another part of me is going ""Or. we pretend this series of unfortunate events never happened and we try again with our pride intact"". 2 more wake stones later, I have the horsemans head. pause. and a few more gray hairs to add to my collection from game induced PTSD.10/10. Buy it. But it twice. This game is so much damn fun!I have a 980 ti. I run it on lowest settings and the towns run like molasses in December. Fuckin worth it though. OR RIGHT! As for the DLC shit. Everything in the DLC section you can earn in game so don't worry about any of that trash, pawn edits, character edits, all in game with in game money, rift stones, RC, the works, all earnable. Only having one character is a bit. dumb. But the gameplay is what matters most and its such a good time!",1
Positive,"I love this game. I'm IMMERSED in this game. Just wandering around hills and dales and stumbling on a ogre and a drake fighting and just standing and watching from a far off cliff is such a strange and intimate feeling. I dismissed a pawn and he said, ""I've strangely grown fond of you."" and I nearly cried.",1
Positive,"1st playthrough: 152hPraises- Amazing combat echoing the design of the first one. The options you have in each vocation are very fun, but I'm especially happy warriors are shining in this game- Atmospheric lighting that lifts all locations, day or night- Greatly rewarding exploration- Emergent gameplay thanks to a combination of pawn AI, player moveset and enemy interactions with their environment. There's really no other games like this, but Monster Hunter may come close- Great combat music. The dynamic regular combat theme of Vermund and Battahl are some of my favorites.- One of the best character creator I've seen, and not because there's many sliders, but because it has THE best preset system in any creators, ever. You have dozens of presets to choose from, and each of them have 9 subpresets, with 7 more slight edits of those subpresets. This allows players to go in character creator without being overwhelmed by options, as they can just tweak some existing preset choices that they like.Criticisms- Barely serviceable main story with weird pacing, especially near the end concerning a certain tower.- Dialogue writing is definitely inferior to DD1, especially when it involves The Dragon.- Lots of characters don't seem to have enough involvement in the main story, including Empress Nadina who's featured on the cover art.- Controls can be frustrating, like your character jumping off a ledge where you barely pressed movement (especially bad with keyboard)- Lack of FoV slider. The super close 65 FOV is insanely straining to the eyes and claustrophobic. Too often did I misjudge a ledge's height because of the FOV (8/9 of my deaths in my whole playthrough were non-combat falls).- Lack of a very strong main theme. Not reusing Eternal Return from DD1 is criminal, and even moreso that the main theme's barely present in any other songs in the OST. Eternal Return's leitmotifs were part of why the OST was so memorable.- Lack of enemy variety in some regards, especially big monsters. Without spoiling anything, there's even some areas that could benefit from HUGE creatures like the hydra, but they left them awkwardly empty.- Lack of variety for NPC quests (culling the monsters and escorts are the only ones)Overall experienceAfter waiting more than a decade for a sequel, and despite my criticisms, this is still a dream come true and I'm absolutely happy with my experience. I'm looking forward to possible expansions in the future, but I really hope it also gets the same treatment as Monster Hunter: World with free DLCs that expand on existing content. Perhaps we can get notice boards back to Pawn Guilds with hunts, and also add more variants that can sometimes replace the roaming ones in the world, such as Gorecyclops, Cockatrice, Living Armor, and more. Please do not repeat Dark Arisen's mistake of locking them to only one content island!Thank you to Itsuno-san and the whole team for bringing this game back to us long time fans, and allowing new players to try out on this series!",1
Positive,"20 hours post launch review:. Game is indeed poorly optimized on launch. It's especially apparent in the main Capital where there are many NPCs. It looks like NPC AIs are bottlenecking the CPU to GPU stream. The game is much more fluid in open world areas even in big fights.Here's what I get on my potatoes:PC#1: i5-6600 / RTX 2060 = Mostly low settings: 45-60fps in open world / 25-35fps in capital. PC#2: Ryzen 5 / GTX 1070 = Low settings: 25-35fps in open world / 15-25fps in citiesI personally think the game is still gorgeous with Low settings. Microtransaction drama is overblown. It looks bad but they're all essentially Pay shortcuts for things easily obtainable ingame. You can still hire your Steam friends' Pawns for free for easy RC. Gold is easily obtainable ingame. Personal take on the game so far: Save for performance issues, I absolutely love it. This is the sequel I dreamt of and I'm so happy they actually delivered something 200% faithful to the original. Everything feels like Dragon's Dogma and honestly given the kinda niche popularity of the first game I wasn't sure they'd go all in on that.Combat is tight, varied and goes beyond the heights of the first game in terms of sheer Epicness while strangely not suffering much from the performance issues. You can tell they mixed the DD / Monster Hunter combat formula even tighter in this one. This is absolutely Top 3 Action RPG combat tier.Open world exploration mixed with Pawn interaction is further refined from the first game. No immediate fast traveling, Max health reducing from taking combat damage combined to carry weight limits forces planning travels carefully. No exploring the whole map on your first time like in Elden Ring, which leads to no Open World fatigue. The world feels alive, breathing and varied and random encounters of all kinds keep it fresh. Pawns are very useful in guiding you to your quest locations and hidden treasure on the way. No loading screens anywhere. World evolves in parts depending on your actions. Map looks absolutely huge and there's hidden treasure everywhere. Harvesting materials and crafting is well designed and actually really useful, and Pawns help a lot with it. This is the most alive I've ever felt an open world be.Pawn system is similar to DD1 with a few novelties: You can set Quests and rewards for people who hire your Pawns. Eg: ""Slay a Cyclop - 2000G reward"". You can still rent your Steam friends' Pawns for free no matter their level. Pawns also seem much more competent in fighting, especially Vocations that were lacking a bit in DD1 like the 2handed Warrior.35 hours update: Upgraded the 2060 with a 4060, and retired the 1070 with the 2060. Now have:PC#1: i5-6600 / RTX 4060 = Mid/High settings: 50-60fps in open world / 30-35fps in capital. PC#2: Ryzen 5 / RTX 2060 = Mid settings: 45-60fps in open world / 25-35fps in citiesGame is of course much more enjoyable that way for everyone.",1
Positive,"this game is good when you don't have somebody whining in your ear about micro transactions, the micro transactions are more of a Capcom issue than anything else, they were in DMC5 and RE4 too. the thing is though that all of them are completely pointless, all items can be acquired in game and easily too, and no where in game are you ever prompted to buy them. this is a game you have to play for awhile to really appreciate, you will not get a complete picture in only 1 or 2 hours. if you loved the first one, you'll love this, if you're on the fence pick up the first one for cheap and play it for awhile, if you like it or are intrigued then pick this up, it's basically the first one but much bigger and more modern. it's definitely not a game for everyone but for the people it's for, it's like nothing else.",1
Positive,"FUCK DENUVO FUCK MICROTRANSACTIONS To new players: you don't need to buy any of their microtransaction shit, everything is easily obtainable in-game by playing casually. We may even watch CAPCOM learn this isn't console so there is a GPU and it should be utilized instead of expecting the CPU to do everything. With today's (29.03.) Patch, the RAM usage and VRAM usage have been increased. The FPS finally stays above 30 even in crowded cities and towns. The game is a great, fun action adventure, literally Dragon's Dogma but 2. Just don't expect immersive roleplaying. 8/10",1
Positive,"Good game but definitely needs updates. (Edit- I have Given this Game a Positive due to Mods/soon to bechanges)[Will be changed soon->Such as New Game and Save Slots] and Some Optimizations. And So FAR into the Story you only are allowed to Equip 4 Skills unlike the 6 you could have in DDDA So No Mages with 3 Support spells and 3 attacks. No Bowmen with 3 Dagger skills and 3 Bow skills In fact it seems like they Split the Archer class into 2 ClassesNow longer are the days where you are Range and CC. its either or now with Archer using just a basic Bow and ""Thief"" Using the Duel Daggers.And to those who are talking about the Microtransactions. You literally can buy those items once you reach the City. (Its the Same M.T that DMC5 had with Red orbs and Blue Orbs)The Microtansactions are whatever to the Bigger problems.Taking a look at DDDA. you can change your characters looks in the Main Menu And it doesnt cost anything Unlike In DD2 you goto the Barber and it costs 10k for basic shit!, and theres New game and Load Game. and The Beds didnt cost an arm and a leg. The City Inn costs 500 gold in DDDA. And not to mention you want to be sleeping alot at the Inn's to have a Save point and to Update your pawns, which doesn't happen while camping.Camping should Do what Inns or atleast being able to update your Pawn for players. Spending 1000-3000 gold just to sleep and update Pawns is Crazy. not to mention if you never slept in an Inn and loaded by last inn rest you could potentially lose on HOURS of play time I misclicked not lost maybe 2-3 hours of playtime involving running to the Left side of the map to deal with the Lizards and exploring the top left of the map along with who knows how much XP i just lost. If i never slept at the Inn before going to the Bar to talk to a guy, I would have RESTARTED FROM THE START. because i did that already right after the first fight you do.Wait a month or 2 for patches and maybe when the game starts seeing positive reviews ill change my review because SURELY it got better.",1

Positive,No idea why people are complaining about microtransactions. I've played 7 hours roughly and still have yet to find a single one. Game is very similar to the original so if you liked it I reccomend. Also I have seen lots of bad review due to negative performance and optimization. No idea what their graphics settings are but I have a 3070 and have no issues other than some motion bluring in the main cities where there are lots of npcs and this is with the graphics set high.

Positive,"OK, i know of the bad reviews and some points are valid, most importantly the lack of optimization, The game gets wonky in large towns and when several NPCs are around. But the game also has an amazing level of detail which I greatly enjoy. Like . i jump off a cliff and use my shield for protection, leading to a audible metallic clonk when I land. Or when pushed the gigantic bird together with my team down a ravine while it was immobile. Or the time I jumped off a cliff to land on an ogre, hitting its head causing towns of damage. The quests are nothing outstanding but not terrible either. I so far enjoyed my 30h and look forward to completing the game.",1

Positive,"It's Dogma.I could say a lot of things but instead focusing on one:If you persist, do as many side quests as you can, learn the world and the NPCs, then Dragon's Dogma 2 will reward you with an amazing, epic endgame experience.",1
Positive,I was turned off by the mixed reviews but I purchased it anyways. As usual most of the negative reviews are entirely over dramatic and childish. So far I've really enjoyed the gameplay and storyline. I have had ZERO FPS or crashing issues.,1
Positive,"First of all, if you're not certain what ladders look like - this game has got you covered. Second, if you think exploration was done well in BotW, this game goes: ""hold my beer"" - and shows how much better it can be done. Third, the attention to detail in DD2 is just phenomena. Oh look, a ladder! A good sturdy ladder. I wonder where it leads. 'Tis a well made wooden ladder, most likely capable of holding the entire party of 4, filled with precious stones and weaponry.Fantastic ladder, truly. 10 out of 10.",1
Positive,"The way I see it is, if people want to spend $70/ 50 on a game, then pay money to reduce the time/enjoyment they can actually get from their purchase by buying items/shortcuts, then good! These idiots need separated from their money! If it wasn't a game developer getting their money, it would be some other snake oil type grift. At least this way the profits help game developers put the money back into game budgets, which directly benefits us all. Why don't all of us with two braincells to rub together all just chill and let Capcom do their thhaaang. 12/10 - not enough micro-transactionions.",1
Positive,"Dragon's Dogma 2 is a faithful sequel bringing everything that the original had to offer to modern devices.The game features engaging combat, beautiful landscapes, a great sense of adventure and exploration on an unique fantasy setting. You can easily get lost going from combat encounter to the next, or maybe just going around completing sidequests or finding secrets around the map. It is everything it promised to be and a marvelous experience to go through.Playing this game is nothing but a guarantee that you will have an unique action fantasy adventure full of tales of heroism as you go back and recall all the epic battles you encountered.There's nothing greater than videogames can achieve as an artform than an unique experience catered to you. Every encounter has the potential of being a one in a kind with it's plethora of synergizing mechanics and engaging combat. I am incredibly happy with this game and my purchase.Next I want to address some of the common complaints when it comes to this game as I feel many of them are unjustified and paint a wrong picture as to what Dragon's Dogma 2 really is. This game has received an unfair amount of reviewbombing from less-informed people and seeing the backlash was nothing but heartbreaking as an avid fan. Everyone is free to dislike or like whatever they want but when there's this amount of missinformation going around I feel it is unfair to the game and those that want to experience it having played the original Dragon's Dogma or not.On the game's launch, there's been a great number of reports of performance issues in the game. Some people even resorted to committing mass murder of the NPCs in towns to increase the FPS. This was addressed by Capcom not a day after launch and they have announced a performance patch coming our way. If you have concerns regarding this you can wait a few weeks until this patch rolls out and see if the game runs better on your device by then.I personally have not had any major issues regarding performance. Though it is noticeable on certain areas, being this a single-player action RPG, I'm not really concerned with some frame drops here and there so I still managed to have a very enjoyable experience, but I'm aware that this is different from device to device. And since Capcom was quick to announce a performance patch I will save any critiques regarding performance until then. The microtransactions of this game are unnecessary, unintrusive, and they also were present on the original Dragon's Dogma in the same format. I do not get the backlash regarding this at all, if you do not believe these microtransactions should be in the game then don't buy them and leave a bad review on the DLC page , the game still offers a great experience without them. My only guess as to why this got blown up out of proportion is that at the game's launch many people were not accostumed to the game's inventory and felt like these items were necessary / inaccessible through normal gameplay which is not true for any of them.If you left your bad microtransaction review on the DLC page you are incredibly based and deserve a medal.Dragon's Dogma 2 is a very faithful sequel. That includes doubling down on the mechanics and gameplay experience that the original offered. One of my fears on this games launch was that the Dragon's Dogma experience was going to get drastically changed to fit a ""modern"" playerbase. Not to say that the game is outdated, quite the contrary, it adapts greatly to the modern landscape while still maintaining the original gameplay experience.In the current gaming landscape of a million souls-like and ""modern"" game design decisions present on every single game, Dragon's Dogma 2 is a breath of fresh air bringing back some forgotten design decisions and player experience.Some people are not a big fan of this, however I am. There is no better time than now for games to bring back everything that is now forgotten from the previous generations. Not every game needs to follow the same template, there were countless of creative minds in videogame development decades before the games of today who were trying to innovate and bring something new to the table on each installment. This was lost throughout the time.Gameplay like this should be celebrated.This is another common complaint I hear, mostly by people that have not experienced the original or are seeing the game from the outside trying to make a decision and they are unsure if to make their purchase or not after their 15th Cyclops fighting gameplay they watched.I understand how this can be concerning to some people, but I assure you this is less of an issue than it seems. The combat of this game brings you the tools to face an encounter in a plethora of ways. Every enemy is designed to be faced from multiple angles, multiple strategies, team compositions and builds.I most prefer 1 encounter built for 100 scenarios, than 100 encounters that only bring 1 scenario.That being said, the game does offer more enemy variety that is first apparent, but these are more hidden encounters that you learn of as you get further into the game, bringing a breath of fresh air and a new challenge to the Arisen as they grow stronger fighting the most regular enemies.Furthermore, due to the very engaging combat and gameplay variety, you hardly feel like you are on the same battle each time. Give it enough time and you will notice how unique these encounters can be. Hadly any Ogre I faced was the same as another.You made it to the end, thanks for reading my review first and foremost.I wish I could've spent most of this review writing about the things I liked and unique encounters I've had rather than spend so much time addressing these complaints. Like I said, it was heartbreaking to witness the public reception for this game. But hopefully after enough given time, people start looking at the game for what it truly is. An incredible action adventure fantasy experience.My hope is that as time goes on we start seeing more games like this where developers are not afraid to bring back gameplay experiences that are not present on the current landscape of games. Let's strive for a more diverse and engaging videogame sphere.",1
Positive,"TL;DR - Great game overall, There's *a lot* to do and see. exploration is the highlight for me.There's so many things you can do in this game with pawns and the different vocations that you really need to experience that for yourself. exploitation was a lot of fun. I'm not a fan of the escort quests and found them mostly annoying nor of how you need to travel around to upgrade weapons/armor.Beautiful game with some of the best environments I have seen in a game recently.A lot of fun to be had with this one and a lot of hours you can sink into it. recommended.PSA- it's extremely easy to be locked out of certain achievements and quests. you've been warned.they fixed and patched most of the issues I had with the game in terms of performance and crashes. this might not be 100% the case for everyone but I'm now able to play for hours without crashing or having huge performance issues.The main selling point for me here is the freedom (limited but still a lot more than other games) and exploration in the game.This game gave me a lot of hours of fun and I recommend it.",1
Positive,"No other game beats its sense of adventure, not even the first game. Grab some pawns, pick a direction and go. That's when the game is the most fun. You will still find hidden areas and dungeons long after you thought you had seen everything.",1
Positive,"This sequel has blown the original out the water. Absolutely amazing. After completing the game several times, updating my review seemed to be right with inclusion of afterthought.The game itself on a mechanical level has, in most parts succeeded it's previous game into sharper, more reactive gameplay. However the story is somewhat lacking in terms of depth and feels like nothing more than a hollow quest chain with no real value towards itself, I had more fun roaming the world than the main quest itself.All in all, the games still worth playing but if you're looking for a story to greatly surpass that of DD1 then look to be disappointed.",1
Positive,"Hey I see you need a revive. *reads Ubisoft micro-transaction manual* For 99 cents you too get this ONE use revive. Don't worry we have plenty in stock! For all the good Capcom did with this game you really are selling revives for 99 cents?! how can you justify charging people for RC like this? This game is full price! You were supposed to be the chosen one! you were meant to defeat the dragon not become it! This is basically a remake of the first game and while its a damn good game, in its current state of poor optimization and micro translations.** Edit** I should not recommend this to anyone but im going to because its WORTH playing. These items are obtainable in game, yes and they are pretty easy to get. Please don't pay money for a game and then pay money to not play portions of it. I look forward to hiring your hideous pawns and THROWING THEM INTO THE WATERFALLS!",1

Positive,"I'm sold, this is great game!",1
Positive,"Before i get into the review I gotta say my specs, Ryzen 7 5800X, RTX 3070TI (overclocked), 32gb ram. My feelings towards the game equate to like a 70% satisfaction rating and my reasoning for this is first off the speed at which the player can travel without the aid of the ferrystone, It's a very slow process that some can say brings them joy but for me I just wish the devs had thought about adding mounts or something because the oxcarts are useful but they don't get you everywhere. World size, I thought this game world was gonna be fuckin giant right but you get 3~ major cities (elves are secondary and not even required to beat the game or are even implemented into the main story) and a handful of shitty little shantytowns/ military encampments. How do you make a world somewhat large and feel monotonous to go through?the microtransactions don't bother me at all cause you can either actually play the damn game and get them or go to the guy next to the big ass rift stone in the main city and buy the items (playing the game gets you items? no way ) cause as said in pretty much all the dlc besides the custom sounds, its all obtainable dipshit you just pay to get it earlier.Story was aight ig but how are you gonna make a threat that can essentially bring the world into a dark age and only implement 2 races into the story? this isn't like aliens only landing in bum fuck nowhere in the states like every movie bro its a whole ass world that's meant to have other races besides beastren and humans.Performance def does have something left to be desired but I'm running max everything and getting 40~ frames in the city and 60-70 in the open world (before making a review check what settings you're on and before you buy a game check the recommended specs)Lots of stuff to do in the game and I accidentally beat it cause I had my brain off while doing the last few quests. Once again the dlc is literally just so you get shit early so how about you dipshits complain about game flaws not extra shit you brainless retards. Im just saying this cause I hate when people don't even know what makes them mad and when people hate for the sake of hating.",1
Positive,"You shot giant ass ballista bolts at flying griffons/dragons or puny harpies. You do what has to be done. Protect the kingdoms of man from foul creatures.You chop up small monster and bandits, or swing your gigantic sword in the face of dumb trolls OR dragons. You see big health bar go wooooop. Life be gone. You get to command your own 4-man party and decide if you want 4 warriors in your group for even more ass whopping or if you want sorcerers in your line that bring down burning meteors.If your slaves pawns are acting strange or talk too much because they want to show you the billion of chests nearby. you introduce them to lake. Show them the brine that lurks in there to free you of endless chattering. It's honestly a really refreshing game because you get to make decisions. Help the local people now or later. maybe they're dead later on, or you get a different reward. Decide to forge copies of items to fool innocent NPC's and give the real item to a scumbag next door that offers you waaaay more and double crash in your rewards from both. Sure, the MTX (DLC's) is annoying to see, but you don't need to interact with it. It's a singleplayer game anyway. If you want an extra portcrystal then you can pay for it or just earn it honest in-game. You don't NEED these items, everything you need is in-game achievable.Honestly, this is the biggest flaw this game has currently. (there weren't any patches as of now)If you don't own a pretty beefy system, this game could be frustrating to enjoy.I haven't played on low, my system can play this game on maxed, but even my PC gets down to 40fps in cities because the game calculates every NPC. Bigger cities = more people = bigger CPU load.Hopefully they improve the performance with patches SOON and or put frame gen in this, that could help some people.I'm really enjoying this gem. Glad I bought it!",1
Positive,company makes game only 5% of steam users can run and then are shocked at review bombs,1
Positive,"I was a big fan of the first game and Dragons Dogma 2 did NOT disappoint. I didnt have so much fun with a game for a hot minute. Also to whoever is reading this, most of the negative reviews are from salty people who didnt bother to inform themselves about anything and just wanna hate for no reason.This game does not deserve the hate, it is drop dead gorgeous!Plus, my PC sucks sometimes so I expected a lot of lags etc. but esp since the update its really smooth even tho my setup is not the best :3",1
Positive,"A really enjoyable sequel in my opinion. The exploration, the combat and the look of the game is stellar, its one of those games that you cant wait to get back into, and spend half your day playing if you can until you finish it. Sadly it has some issues, such as the low enemy variety, the constant fighting, and the low replay value. Still if you liked the previous game you will probably like this too, but might worth it to wait for a discount if your standards are high.",1
Positive,"Really enjoying it. So much hidden loot, collectibles, exploration stuff, despite capcom outlawing garden gnomes. The main story was a bit weak, but all the side quests and dungeons pad it out so much. I had so much fun exploring. Lot of novel mechanics and interactions too. Fps issues seem to have been fixed now. Few annoying quest bugs prevented me from full-clearing in 1 playthrough, but all in all I had a blast with this @ ~130h for my 1st run. My pc isn't super amazing so I had to tone down some stuff.mostly-stable 1080p60 w/ opts: https://imgur.com/a/udpDdP9 on a 5600x, 3060ti, nvme, 32g ramStarting the game was a bit frustrating as I had fk all carrying weight, like loot 10 plants and get heavy. Seems tied to character weight/height - 46kg @ 160cm :c No target lock = hard to maintain a persistent target with targets moving acutely relative to camera on movement-heavy classes like Thief.But lotta fun classes, though warrior and trickster seem undertuned, with the latter just being an exercise in frustration. At least you can level everything passively via warfarer.mtx stuff is whatever since it's minor resources in a 1p game. By the time I beat the game I had 20k RC and ~900k gold. As long as you hire pawns around your level, you'll never go RC negative.",1

Positive,"Great game, unfortunate MTX and bad, though playable, performance. For clarification, I have a Ryzen 5 3600g & GTX 4060 (8gb VRAM) with 24gb RAM.Game's fun, controls take a bit to get used to but I personally don't mind it a lot. The microtransaction is, despite what a lot of people are saying (and it's their fault for not clarifying that), obtainable in-game easily, which makes it better than MHW and considering it's Capcom, I have to snort copium and consider that a W.Runs smoothly at ~50 fps outside of the main city for me with some sparse drops when there's plenty of effects, but I did have to customize my graphics. DLSS on auto, High (1GB) texture are the only changes I had to make from the High preset on my setup. Experienced only one crash so far. Performance in the main city seems to be CPU-bound, so lowering graphics won't help much there, and I imagine there will be a fix sometime soon.",1
Positive,"This game is honestly fantastic. The setting is dark and gritty, the combat is fluid, and I've been enjoying the player created pawns. Subjectively, this will be my GOTY 2024.I do wish this game performed better, there is no reason with RTX off, I should be getting sub-60 FPS.[5800x, 32GB RAM, 7900XTX]FSR3 does nothing but ruin fidelity in this title. I understand this will come with time, and the game is completely playable. I haven't encountered any game breaking bugs yet.The only negative I have regarding gameplay is the vague quest destinations, or no information at all. [All is solved with simple Google search]But I don't wanna use a 3rd source, I prefer to figure it out and some of the quests don't do a great job leading the user to the objective.[Beggar, Shadow. Iykyk]I recommend buying this at a price point of $45 or less.",1
Positive,"Dragons Dogma 2, where do I even begin. This is easily one of the best RPGs released in current day alongside titles similar to Elden Ring. The game-play itself is immersive and the amount of depth and sheer exploration potential is seemingly limitless. The map is huge, the pawns/followers interact and actively chat, making adventuring seem incredibly immersive and detailed. Between personalities, applications of classes and vocations, experience, you name it, all these things come greatly into play in Dragons Dogma 2. The enemies can be towering or minuscule, each posing their own challenges and rewards. The amount of side quests, areas to explore, and depth of progress along with hidden items allows for very long playtime. Renting friends' pawns and giving them gifts or experience for the future is also very fun, as is creating your own custom pawn and renting them out to others! Cheers to hoping they add a DLC as vast and intense as Dark Arisen was for Dragons Dogma original. Regarding the micro-transactions, they are all optional items which are *very easily* found in-game, therefore they simply exist as a customer idiocy trap. Realistically i believe these shouldn't even exist, just simply bad practice, though luckily no actual powerful elements to be found here.Regarding performance, this is probably the key factor driving many customers away currently, as the game could run so much better than it is currently. The game DOES suffer quite a lot of performance issues in terms of FPS and stability, however this can be somewhat remedied through launch settings, ingame settings, and control panel settings. Hoping for improvement so those with lesser PCs can still enjoy this amazing title in full glory as deserved. Immersion and gameplay : 11/10Performance and FPS: 4/10Main story and soundtracks: Classic Dragons Dogma, 10/10Customization and replay value: 10/10",1
Positive,"First of all. My old ass pc is from 2017 and runs this at 55-65 fps with medium to high settings. Only in the capital it drops to around 40.Second of all. Everything that can be bought with real money is easily obtainable in the game. Its not even endgame locked, you can literally get the change appearance thing in the first two hours of the game. Its even easier to get than in DD1.I absolutely love this game already. The world is beautiful. The combat is basically like in the first game but so much better. I defeated an ogre so early while traveling with a women, that it made me feel like theres also more skill and enemy knowledge involved than in the first game.The world is designed in such a lovely way, ive been missing something like this for years. There are secrets everywhere you look. And not just basic open world stuff. There is like a cave thats so large and complex with multiple hidden bosses and loot and you could just walk past it. (Or should because youre gonna get fd up if you go in there in early game lol) There are so many little things to explore, the world feels a hundred times more alive than in DD1 and id say the last time an open world was this good was in witcher 3. Then there are all these little interactions with your pawns. It feels so much more alive. Like you just fought for your live to defeat an ogre way to strong for you and then your pawn comes up and gives you a fist bump like that was just another day lol.Dont review Bomb Games folks. Think for yourselves and build your own opinion.",1
Positive,Game is fun and i'm having fun,1
Positive,"FPS is a bit shaky when you arrive to town.And that ends my list of complaints, performance is a big element. But one should take the context as a whole when evaluating a product. I have the luck of having the game run smoothly otherwise (in towns the FPS goes to a shaky 45+). But the art direction and game systems managed to bring new life to a worthy sequel of a hidden gem from the previous generation. The game is solid, the story is good and the NPCs ""matter"". I really like this game.",1
Positive,game so good i can't breathe help,1
Positive,"DD2 is an absolute masterpiece. If youre a fan of dark fantasy (LOTR, Berserk, Claymore, Castlevania) then this game will knock it out of the park for you. The first game was great, they took it to the absolute next level with the 2nd. The visuals are breathtaking, the combat is super fun, story super in depth and shrouded in mystery. The absolute vastness of the world and the monstrosities that inhabit the land make this a game worth picking up. 30 hours in and i haven't even scratched the surface of what is beneath. Don't listen to those who complain about the microtransactions (yes, you get everything in game. Just be mindful of the resources you earn/collect and youll be fine) and framerate (yes, its a little rough in cities. But you are in them for literally 2 minutes shopping/quest turn in and that is pretty much it.) Highly recommend 12/10.",1

Positive,"15 Hours in and loving it. Best 1-sentence summary of what it feels like so far for me is: A janky but incredibly fun combat system, ensuring lots of memorable moments in boss fights and exploration. tons of different enemies, lots of environmental tools and tricks to work into your play style etc. Big variety of skills and passives to play around with. (don't forget to equip your main pal with combat skills and augments!) Personally this was my biggest concern about the game since I am not a ""summoner build"" type player and generally dislike managing too many characters at once. Once you get the flow of the pawn commands and what they bring to the party and how to swap em out, it's relatively smooth sailing. I thought I would be annoyed with them quite soon, but it does actually feel kinda cozy to explore that way, and can be very useful in terms of exploration and problem solving. Improvements can be made on player-pawn inventory management tho. The setting and world building is great: Lots of lore to dive into, voice acting is believable most of the time. Vast fauna & flora, different religions, cultures, languages and overall scope make it a very immersive experience. NPC vendors outright being pieces of shit and scamming you blatantly hits a bit too close to home, but shows the different approach they've taken to the world interaction compared to the generic AAA RPG approach. Game running great for me in general (I do have a 4080 Super + Ryzen 7800X3D so it should), with some fps drops (45fps lowest) here and there in cities like Venworth due to NPC densityAs a MTX-aversed person, you won't even notice them being in the game at all: it was not pushed upon me in any way during the 15 hours I've played so far, I wouldn't even know they exist in the game if it weren't for the controversy noise in the gaming space.Is it dissapointing that MTX is in this full priced single-player game, especially one relating to ""fast travel"" with the director making applaudable statements about ""making the journey fun"" being the solution? -> Yes. Did it impact my experience within the game at all, by it either being pushed down my throat, or essential comfort of life being virtually pay-walled? -> Not once, not at all. Looking forward to sinking a ton more hours into this as of now!",1
Positive,"The performance of the game is pretty poor. The primary stated reason by Capcom is that the processing for NPCs is complex and demanding, but this doesn't seem to benefit the player in any clear way. Their behaviors are hardly more complex than what we've seen in previous games in terms of how they decide to move around, perform their role in a quest, and the sorts of things they do as in-game time passes. I'm not sure if the performance seen here is a problem unique to Dragon's Dogma 2, or if we're seeing a possible achilles heel for the engine itself, but it's notable and is worth mentioning. The deluxe edition contents (and as an extension, all of the separate DLCs you can purchase individually) are a scam. The contents of them are no better than what the game will award you for normal play, for free, without really going out of your way to grind for it. So it gets to occupy an uneasy position of not being so potent that it feels like a must have, while also being so impotent that any price you can pay for it with real cash is too high. This is the sort of fluff that you'll often see in deluxe editions or given away as pre-order incentives for other titles, where their value is unknown to the player prior to playing the game, and they get the marketing benefit of listing a lot of different things to trick you into thinking there's something of value to be had. Don't fall for it here, but also, stop falling for it in other titles, too. I promise you that those exclusive cosmetics or cheater items will make you stick out like a sore thumb and often completely hose the balance and challenge of the game for some time.Anyway.I think the game is good. Everything points back to the absence of cheap or convenient fast travel being crucial to the design of the game. Every threat the game has, every resource you can bring along to mitigate said threats, every form of currency or collectable item only has value because just getting to and from any one location comes with an inherent degree of risk, and the cost associated with attempting to bypass it either comes with more risk (using oxcarts, camping on the trail in place of sleeping at an inn) or a high in-game currency cost (10k gold per ferrystone, always a limited quantity in stock from NPCs, the value of gold never truly goes down and 10k is always a lot, this same gold you'll very much want to be using to buy better equipment or offer as rewards for pawn quests to get items and pawn badge progress from other players.). Any paid system that bypasses this serves to eliminate one of the most unique things this game has and one of the few things it does to stand out.In general, I think gamers have forgotten that we're not on a linear track towards some ideal form of game, where every modern convenience we've come to take for granted is some absolute that we can never go back on. Limitations and restrictions breed creativity, and in this case, it's leveraged to make exploring out in the field for too long or at the wrong time genuinely threatening. Even as you out level an area, acquire and fully upgrade the best gear you have access to, and in general pump your stats up so high that enemies can scarcely damage your HP anymore, they can always use the environment to kill you, or you can still be careless in a larger fight and get poked to death from a series of stuns or debilitations anyway.Some decisions you make are permanent (the selected race for your and your pawn, choices you make during certain quests), others are costly to alter (voice and appearance for you and your pawn, resurrecting an NPC that died), and some of the quests don't have a completely predictable outcome given the choices the game offers you. The combat and action appear simple on its surface, and players that have a decent amount of capacity to theorycraft for their party composition and build choices will find it easier yet, but a lot of what the game has to offer is a constant wager of attrition - enticing you to stay out just a little bit longer to get as much as you can done and explored before consuming a precious Ferrystone to go back to town, or even trying to tempt you into walking all the way back to avoid using one to begin with. You've got all of this Loss built up, doesn't it sound like a good idea to sleep at this camp instead of going back to town? Etc.The main quest storyline is probably the least engaging part of the game, as it's also an area where you're offered the least amount of agency in terms of outcome. There's a script and you've got to play your part - though there are 3 possible endings, the one you get largely comes down to a series of clear choices right at the climax. I found exploring the fields and participating in side quests to be far more engaging. Not only could I ""make my own fun"", many of the side quests have at least two possible outcomes based on what decisions you make or actions you take, and the stakes feel high - failure to help someone now or even thinking you're doing the right thing by intervening at all can get someone killed or make them hate you, closing off the rest of that quest line at a minimum. Here is where the NPCs manage to make themselves interesting, and how the world ends up feeling more lived-in and believable. Much of what I've said here is true of the first game, also available on Steam, ""Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen"". This isn't so much a sequel to that as it is a re-imagining, and it was fun to play in the presence of, and compare notes with someone close to me that has beaten that game, but not yet played this one. I think both of them can co-exist. New players shouldn't feel pressured to play Dark Arisen, and those hungry for more have an entire other game to play that is very similar on a surface level, but does enough differently to feel like you're not just doing New Game+ in Dragon's Dogma 2.You pretty much get what you put in for this game, but as an aging gamer that tires of everything out there trying to be my Forever Game with endless multiplayer fun or procedurally generated levels and runs to contend with, it's nice to pick up a single player game that has something different to say, and the decency to come to an end before you may be finding the action or the world tedious. If the price turns you away, you don't have a computer or console that can run it well, or you want an adjacent experience that's more friendly to portable computers like the Steam Deck, pick up Dark Arisen instead. This game is fine and good for those that have the luxury of being able to play it and a tolerance for highly variable performance or the ability to tolerate console-like framerates by capping the game to something between 30-45 FPS.",1
Positive,"Runs very well and thats just the only good thing about it.Game is extremely woke and thats disheartening for a father of 3 little gamers who were excited to play this mess of a game. I cant allow them to play something that includes: furries, democratic party cameos, & men on men lovemaking scenes. SPOILER WARNING: YOU HAVE TO LAY WITH A DUDE AND ITS A 20 MINUTE QUICK TIME EVENT",1
Positive,"Game fixed a lot of the jank in Dragon's Dogma Dark Arisen, the MTX aren't a big deal to me, all of the items are things I've found in game, even if rarely. Game is gorgeous, though framerates could be better on a 3060.",1
Positive,"Game is a blast, nothing better than traveling the world with the pawns of your friends and working together as a team. After most fights there is an opportunity to high five a pawn, 11/10.",1
Positive,Just spent thousands of dollars on teleportation items and now I no longer need to walk everywhere. Stay walking broke boys,1
Positive,"Having a great time. Don't listen to negative reviews about microtransactions, all of those items can be earned in game.",1
Positive,"Love the game play, the story, the pawn interactions and randomness, love the giant monsters, and the character customization is amazing! The fact there is micro transactions in the game sucks but just ignore them. Its just the company trying to squeeze a few extra bucks for stuff you can earn in game.",1
Positive,"There is an incredible game tucked just under a slight layer of likely Publisher-inflicted scum at the surface. I don't condone the microtransactions (aside from the audio pack one, that's honestly neat!), but it's both safe to ignore them, and more true to what the experience of the game favours to ignore them.The experience of roaming around, letting discoveries snowball into interesting, dangerous detours, or having surprise run-ins with larger monsters out in the wild, paired with the distinct feel of the different vocations (at least of what I've seen so far, can't wait to try Trickster), hits a real sweet spot for fantasy expeditions. Pawns are interestingly fleshed out, aside from some Lemming-esque pathing at times, and the way that quests start to loosen the reins and trust you to figure things out is refreshing.And, since the internet can't seem to stop talking about it, it seems the game is quite willing to put real, earnest pitfalls in the player's path. Ones that it warns you about in subtle and overt ways, though I've only gotten the former so far. Ignore those warnings, and you'll be severely punished in ways that may take a ton of effort to recover from. It's wild in a real cool way to me to have that sort of Consequence slipped in at a game of this scale, the kind of thing that might happen in a roguelike that you'd eventually reroll. But it seems like the game is built for you to take that occurrence in stride, move on from it, work to correct it as best you can. That's something built into the game's systems that's earnestly scary as a player, that you don't really see a game commit to very often. It's a bit of a shame that I've had it spelled out for me across various headlines and bits of info, and it's why I'm very nebulously talking around it.Lastly, I do appreciate the rate at which you gain vocation levels; between that, and a quest nudging me to try out Archer for a bit, I left my usual fighter-warrior go-to and found it surprisingly satisfying to rain down support from afar in this game. It feels like it encourages exploring more vocations, compared to the first game. I highly recommend giving it a chance, and putting some trust in the sorts of friction it gives the player.",1
Positive,"This game is literally everything that I wanted from a sequel for the original game. Please ignore all of the Redditor tier garbage takes about the completely and utterly irrelevant MTX this game has.The gameplay is an absolute upgrade from the first game in every single way, the world is dynamic and very vertical, the story is perfectly serviceable, remakes of all prior gear and skills are just what old fans like myself wanted. All classes are genuinely fantastic now, which is a huge positive for this game as well. I genuinely can't see any wrong with this game, as someone that has actually played the game before reviewing it, I would highly recommend getting this game. If you've come looking for a dynamic, eventful, epicly scaled, and jam packed RPG ripe for perfecting then you've found it.Whether thyself be a former Arisen, or one that ne'er once entered the cycle, steel thyself for the coming journey.",1
Positive,"The game is good, a lot of people had or keep having knee jerk reactions to some issues like the MTX, or the performance, however the things in the store are a scam, everything can be earned in-game. Performance wise, there's a lot of things you can do to troubleshoot and fix your performance, I went through the trouble of doing so and I'm now running the game on ultra at a steady 80 fps, ray tracing on and effects. Only turned down the shadows and I think the tree details. However, the performance of the game out the gate should not be like this and it's unacceptable. Hopefully whenever they remove Denuvo down the line, performance increases significantly, along with further improvements and updates. I haven't even finished the game yet at all, but I am having a blast. It's been a really, really long time for me when I got lost in an open world setting and explored while fully enjoying the journey, and this game has achieved that for me. Hopefully people do give this game another shot because the game is a gem. The first game was phenomenal, and I believe this one is too. I was taken aback by the performance issue, but was determined to power through it and giving the game a shot and can safely say, this is my personal GOTY.",1
Positive,"Game greatOptimization badUseless mtx, it's like if Bethesda had minerals as dlc for Skyrim. Buy them if you're lazy and don't want to play the game, or don't, and just play the gameIf you like this one, play the original game too",1
Positive,+Amazing successor to original Dragons Dogma+Very Pretty+Harems-Micro-transactions +Micro-transactions are only in 3rd party stores not the actual game. +Micro-transactions aimed at dumb whales for stuff you can get effortlessly in-game.-Poor performance even on high end rigs +Can be tweaked to be playable if your autism will allow you to play anything at 60fps and lower. +Still looks ok on lower settings +Future patches likely to improve performance-$100Great game but maybe wait for a special and patches to fix performance.,1
Positive,"Great game, already living up to it's predecessors fame and beyond. For me atleast, running very smoothly without any hiccups and no bugs either so far except a couple sidequests but nothing groundbreaking.As what comes to the mixed reviews status, I get that the smoothness is a privilege unfortunately to top of the line rigs and Capcom will definitely push out performance patches to combat this, by appearance the game doesn't warrant such kind of performance hits.As what it comes to outrage of the available DLC's, in this day and age I've grown too used to them. But then again, Capcom did the same with the other games and nobody batted an eye (RE4 etc.). In the end, it's just lazy tax, doesn't affect anyone else in the slightest (it's a singleplayer game) and merely promotes a culture that has existed and will stay for eons, in this game's case being insignifcant by their true purpose, there's not need to bring an elephant to a room where it doesn't fit.Enjoy the game and the necessary performance patches will surely arrive asap. :)",1
Positive,"The MTX scare is overblown you can earn everything in game very quickly. Having played a lot more the main quest and overall game isn't as good as the first game. It seems like they rushed this game a lot. The combat and overall graphics are nice, just some performance issues. Armor is per class now instead of being universal like in Elden ring. There are less spells and skills. There is no bitter black isle. I barely remember anyone in this game. I still remember the jester, Mercedes, Fornival and many other characters in the first game. The quests in this game is legit trash. Also lower amounts of vocations. No Mystic Knight. Only redeeming part is the combat.",1
Positive,"As of now they are working towards letting people make new save games at their leisure.Combat is fun, and fighting monsters is still great when compared to DD1. There are less portcrystals however, Gold feels like a constant battle to get in the early to mid game, and if you want any good gear then you MUST do quests to afford much of it. The PLOT however is absolutely mindboggling to me. No spoilers here but it breaks DD1 over it's knees and most established lore is ignored from the first game. Go into this as a fresh experience, dont try to apply what you know (plot wise) from the first game. TL;DR, Its Dragon's Dogma 1 but simplified and slightly more refined, with a stellar graphics overhaul and a mediocre plot. Buy this game for monster slaying, not for Baldurs Gate esque dynamic NPCs.",1
Positive,Great RPG so far. Needs some performance updates for major cities though.,1
Positive,10 hours in good so far,1
Positive,"Just like the first one (pre-DA), but slightly better (and sometimes slightly worse in equipment management).",1
Positive,I made my cat my pawn,1
Positive,"people complaining that they have a 3090 and the game runs bad must have the most bricked pc known to man,have a 3070 and the game is absolutely butter smooth and looks amazing. game feels great, looks great and im very happy with the combat so far. recommended",1
Positive,"All the micro transaction stuff can be farmed in-game for free except the music/sound collection. ALL OTHERS CAN BE FARMED in-game entirely for free, and for example: I had earned 4x the rift crystals required to buy the character modification item in-game in less than 5 hours of playing.The performance does sucks a bit, but it's still very playable for me (high settings, 1080p, RX 6600XT), averaging between 40-60 fps. Adjust your settings a little bit and the game still runs fine. The most noticeable performance hits are in cities or highly populated areas.This game is way too good to toss aside over some of the superficial complaints you'll find here in the reviews section. I see a lot of knee-jerk responses, like negative reviews happening with almost no time actually played. The majority of which are over non-existent problems like these freely earn-able items which people would realize if they played the game for longer than an hour before blasting a negative review.Don't get me wrong, I don't like micro transactions existing in single player games either, but if you're giving a thumbs up review to games like Helldivers II, Warframe, and Path of Exile, then giving a thumbs down to Dragon's Dogma 2 for micro transactions that are completely free to unlock by just playing the game. well. that's bordering on hypocrisy wouldn't you say? Unfortunately this logic will fall on deaf ears most likely.Well, whatever. I'm finding the game tremendously enjoyable. I am flabbergasted by all the recent negative reviews, and the common cause of the negative reviews also left me confused and sad, hence my positive review. I hope it finds someone interested in the game and helps them see through all the sheep.",1
Positive,"I enjoyed this game because this is a genre i am really into and was a big fan of the first game. First of i gotta say no other game like dragons dogma has made combat so damn fun it was the same feeling i had when i played the first game, the class systems and abilitys are fun to use and can swap then out whenever you want. The world is beautiful and full of mystery and kinda of makes you feel like your playing an old school rpg, while its not has hard as i hoped it would be one thing i love is this game doesn't hold your hand and just lets you have an adventure, there are lots of things in this game the game straight up just doesn't tell you so figuring things out yourself is the best way to play i definitely recommend staying away from guide if you can. I really wish more games would take a more risky approach at a game like this.Unfortunately. If you also played the first game you would know it had some major issues as well that really took away from the experience and fun of the game, and almost none of these issues have been addressed in this game at all. i'm talking about these 3 Main issues. 1.Monster variety: the lack of monster variety is easily this games biggest downfall in my opinion. You will be fighting the same damn goblin, wolves, harpies and saurians from start to finish only with different variants as you progress. and just like the first game they will spawn in the same places most of the time is seems too just like the first game, and it seems like there are way more enemies packed together so going travelling between place to place mean you WILL be fighting a whole damn lot of em unless you just start dark souls sprinting past them all. the only saving grace of this is the combat. It's easily the best part of the game so at first you want to cut down everything in your path but things can really start to feel stale after a awhile. Big enemies repeat way too often too and while are awesome to fight become tedious and while there are some cool new big enemies introduced most of them are one time fights and some can even be missed.2.The pawns: Don't be complacent! if you the thought the pawns talked a lot in the first game, but damn its almost like capcom fired it up a notch for this one. At time it can be charming and kinda funny listening to the pawns talk back and fourth as i toss them across canyons to grab loot for me, but i do not need to know every time we pass a ladder or a damn flower that it can be used. It works when there sharing quest knowledge or locations of chests or caves but most of the other times its just damn annoying. there is an option to turn the dialogue off but then you could potentially miss out on important information in case your not paying attention to the subtitles. I was hoping for a little more innovation with the pawn system from the first game but theres only a few new features added nothing to write home about.3.The story: Now i actually like the story of dragons dogma, theirs a certain mystery about it that intrigues me to want to learn more about its world and how things work. But i wouldn't say its an improvement on the first games story, sure it feels more cinematic and has a pretty cool endgame. but something just feels missing from the story. i cant say the real reasons that bothered me about the story without getting into spoilers so il just say there are some real yawn inducing quests here and some subpar voice acting as well, theirs very little interesting side quests or side story arcs and it almost feels like theres a chuck of the main story missing from the game at the halfway mark. i can get over the lip syncing and character models but and rpg should have interesting side quests and adventures and this game just doesn't have enough, and the main story quests arnt really that special either. However it has fixed some issues the first game had, the big one for me fast travel did not feel like such a chore this time, unlike the first game there a multiple ways to get to alot of areas meaning there's room for more exploration and with the world being much bigger than the first you wont be visiting the same areas over and over again breaking up some of the repetitiveness. New ways to fast travel the world other than ferry-crystals this time and there's quite a few inventive ways to travel too. ferry-crystals are a little more common in this game too especially in the late game, and you wont need them for the first bit of the game anyway as you will be exploring the map on foot most the time as you go.All in All i enjoyed my time with dragons dogma 2 and would recommend this game to any fan of action fantasy rpgs with a heavy focus on combat, first story second. none of the micro-transaction interfere with the game at all and can easily be ignored. all of the item you can buy for real $$ are super easy to get in game. Easily a must buy if on sale to atleast give it a go if you like fun combat and wielding big swords.",1
Positive,Best game I've played in 4 years,1

Positive,it good i guess,1
Positive,"Accidentally load from last inn instead of last save, Instantly and Irrevocably lose 5 hours of progress. 12 Years.But GAME GUUD",1
Positive,"this game is SO close to being VERY playable on Steam Deck with decent graphics settings. my only issues are that it tends to stutter and the framerate drops in areas where there are a lot of trees, and it freeze-crashes when i try to acquire and equip new skills. please continue to try and optimize this for deck. it is MUCH closer to being playable than y'all think it is. if i can run Horizon Zero Dawn on ultra graphics settings, i should 100% be able to run this.",1
Positive,"This game has it's issues, not doubt. Poor FPS performance in towns, and a story that ends a bit too abruptly (DO THE SIDE-QUESTS BEFORE YOU DO THE MAIN GAME, TRUST ME). The MTX are just parts of the deluxe edition being sold back to us in pieces, with no baring on the actual game. You don't need to buy any of that crap; it's totally inconsequential.But.what's here is a beautiful successor to one of the most underrated games of all time.The vocations are fantastic, the combat is the best in the genre, and the world is absolutely stunning to look at.If you aren't playing this because of the noise of some angry kids on social media, and some clout chasers on YouTube, then you're missing out. The exact same thing happened with DD1 12 years ago. People gave it poor reception, reviewers crapped on it, and barely anyone played it. And then, YEARS later, people gave it a shot and realized how good it was, and what they missed out on because of the influencers.Don't let that happen again.you'll regret it.",1
Positive,"Performance has been great on my mid-range build, RTX 3070, 10700K with most settings on high. Able to maintain 60fps in the field, some dips to mid 40s at lowest in moderately populated areas like Melve. Anticipating worse performance in the main capital once I get there, but I've been very happy so far.Pawn AI is great; I enjoy them interacting with one another which is a massive upgrade from DD:DA. Love high-fiving them after a tough fight, too. Worth the 10-year wait for me. Disappointed to see the prolific MTX's that are being pushed, particularly ones surrounding customising appearances (this was purchasable with rift crystals in DD:DA, and could be done at any time after you got a specific item iirc) but I'm not going to touch them.Edit: After reaching the city and the main pawn guild, I found a vendor that sells the majority of MTX content for in-game currency, which is very easy to earn. So, this is entirely optional content and not a required buy with irl currency. Wakestones and their pertinent shards (3 shards = 1 stone) are abundant in-game, too.",1
Positive,"First off I would like to address the comments where people say you can't change what your character looks like, this is false it can be done later in the game by all accounts without spending real life money. Second I am using a 3080 and mostly all high settings except no RT/MotionB and I have shadows down and dynamic reflections off, I am also playing on a Super Ultra Wide 32:9. I am around the lowest at 47 fps to-60 fps with no crazy dips or stutters at this point, it's been very crisp for the most part. Now that's out of the way the gameplay has been awesome so far and the game is just beautiful. So far the pawn movement and actions and the combat seem leaps and bounds over Arisen which I played at launch on PS and bought it and played and beat again on Steam. This game has always been quirky and different, I'm sure there are plenty of issues to nit pick but I feel that's all gamers do these days is whine and moan about every game then review bomb refund with 1-2 hours of play. Everyone is acting like this is a cash shop game which is a gross exaggeration. It's been a long wait and so far I am loving it, I shall come back arisen and give another review update further in. I love the original but, I wouldn't say a fan boy by any means. The original deserves it praise for those of us who know and rightly so. Try to enjoy the game and make sure it's what you are looking for and I am sure you will enjoy yourself, never thought gamers would be some of the whiniest cry babies in the world. There are other things in gaming right now that deserve far more scrutiny *cough Sweet.B"".Edit: With even more hours in this game has proven to be amazing and filled with secrets and content. If you choose to listen the review bombs then you will be missing out.",1
Positive,"Dragon's Dogma 2? A Dual-Edged Sword in Fantasy RPGs! ( ' ' )""Dragon's Dogma 2 melds immersive fantasy exploration with deep customization, shadowed by microtransactions and performance hiccups, presenting a rich yet flawed action-RPG experience.""In the realm of action-RPGs, Dragon s Dogma 2 emerges as a beacon of immersive player-driven storytelling and customization, juxtaposed against a backdrop of technical and design challenges. As a single-player, narrative-driven adventure, it beckons players into a rich, expansive fantasy world where choice and companionship redefine the solitary journey.At the heart of Dragon s Dogma 2 lies its expansive, open-world design, allowing players to sculpt their Arisen and journey through a meticulously crafted fantasy realm. The introduction of Pawns, otherworldly beings that accompany players, adds a layer of depth and strategy, making each foray into the unknown a unique experience. The game's combat system is a testament to its commitment to creativity, offering a plethora of vocations that cater to various playstyles. This flexibility, combined with the game's physics, AI, and cutting-edge graphics, crafts a world that is as enchanting as it is immersive.However, the game's ambitious design is not without its faults. User reviews highlight significant concerns, notably the presence of microtransactions in a single-player game. While these can be bypassed, their existence raises questions about the game's monetization strategy. Performance issues, such as game crashes and inconsistent frame rates, further mar the experience for some, though these are not universal experiences and vary greatly by hardware configuration.On the brighter side, the gameplay and combat mechanics are universally praised, offering a balanced and enjoyable challenge that encourages exploration and experimentation. The game's vast map and diverse monsters ensure that adventure lies around every corner, waiting to distract and delight. The narrative, while critiqued by some for not innovating beyond its predecessor, remains engaging for those willing to delve deep into the game's lore and world-building.Yet, Dragon's Dogma 2 s reception is a tale of two cities. While many celebrate its engaging combat and vast world, criticisms regarding the game s vocation system, enemy variety, and adherence to original elements without meaningful evolution are pointed. The unchanged Pawn system and perceived stagnation in storytelling and game mechanics reflect a missed opportunity for innovation.In conclusion, Dragon s Dogma 2 stands as a monumental achievement in creating a deeply customizable and immersive fantasy world. Its success in crafting a unique single-player experience with the illusion of companionship is noteworthy. However, it is not without its blemishes microtransactions, performance issues, and areas lacking innovation dampen its shine. As such, it represents a complex tapestry of immense potential, partially fulfilled promises, and areas ripe for refinement. It's a journey worth embarking on for fans of the genre, provided they navigate its turbulent waters with patience and an open mind.Interested in discovering great Steam games?

Positive,Exploration feels like it MATTERS. Combat is so smooth and the interactions of different characters together to tackle large foes feels better than any other RPG I've played. Beautiful graphics. Feels like a truly dangerous world that I can't stop coming back to. 10/10 would recommend if you enjoy the journey and not the destination.,1
Positive,"UPDATE: 4/25/2024 - Game crashes constantly now with the new patch. Can't play more than 5-10 minutes it seems. I've done all the usual things, updated drivers, verified integrity of files, and so on. The game is more of the same from Dragon's Dogma 1. The world is bigger but is less exciting and new. I still enjoy the game quite a bit just for the combat but I can't recommend it unless, you really enjoyed the first and just want to play that with a slightly newer coat of paint. The quests contain to much back and forth and with the limits to fast travelling can be quite tedious after you've done a few. Very few new creatures exist in this game all the same stuff again. Would have liked to see more creatures. Beastren race seems like a waste of time. I personally filter them out when hiring pawns. They still have the same lack of classes available to pawns as the first which seems like a real shame. Could have given pawns access to more classes and abilities than they did to add a little something to the game. Also the game is still kind of bugged. I did the Sphinx quest to completion and shot her with the unmaking arrow which kills anything in the game but apparently the sphinx never got that memo, so I watcher her fly away unscathed. Now I'm saddled with reloading an Inn save because the game forces a save when you fire that arrow making your choice permanent, which would be fine if the thing worked the way it's supposed too. So I lost a day of progress thanks Capcom, I love it when you waste my time. Still a pretty fun game, I keep plugging away at it.",1
Positive,"Fantastic experience! This is a more than worthy sequel that simply does everything the first game did smoother, slicker, and cooler. Beautiful world, rewarding exploration, and very fun combat. The core of the game - exploration, fighting, and world-building - is done magnificently, and it's what you'll spend the vast majority of your time doing. Pawns and their behaviors are a noticeable improvement over the first game. Performance is very solid, though it takes some tweaking to get it balanced. Gorgeous game.Cons:- Quest design is still lacking in a major way, being either boring, unclear, or downright dysfunctional for even the most basic things. You never know what part of the ""follow"" AI will break next. Even NPCs trying to follow the Arisen down a straight hallway will not always work correctly. Other NPCs will hurl themselves off of cliffs to their deaths or into deep water during a fight. Some quests force players to micromanage their personal inventory for quest-specific items in advance, rather than just allowing the player to pull needed items from storage.which works perfectly fine for other quests. Terrible quest design and execution, overall. (Frustrating.but it's a fairly small part of the game, weird as that sounds.)- Inventory management is better than DD1, but not great. Not even ""good"", to be honest. Not awful, but definitely below the bar.- Fairly lackluster story, made much worse by horrendously stretched-out, terribly implemented quests. So much player time is wasted just running back-and-forth simply to trigger dry dialogue or uninspired cutscenes. Very few exceptions.- Game can progress between ""points of no return"" out of literally nowhere. Take your time with side quests before engaging with main quests._TL:DR / Final verdict:Despite all the flaws, DD2 is well worth the time. The sheer fun of the combat, size of the world, cool character builds, and a very cool premise/lore for a fantasy world makes it worth every minute and every penny, and these things are the vast majority of the game. It can definitely be improved upon, but what's here builds upon the original's formula in a lot of great ways. Recommended!",1
Positive,"An amazing game where you can be wandering down the road, randomly encounter an ogre, climb on its back to slash at its head, then have that ogre carry you thirty feet away into the path of a rampaging minotaur, who then goes on to fight said ogre in a kaiju rumble that attracts the attention of a griffin who swoops down from the sky, picking up your character and delivering them halfway across the map until you finally fall off into the depths of the ocean and get disintegrated by red tentacles. As all of this happens, one of your pawns will say something like, ""Look! A ladder!""Play this, it's epic",1
Positive,"I was worried when I saw the DLC list and was very close to just skipping the game, but I went for it anyway. And am I glad I did. The game is great. The combat is different to what I am used too from most RPGs, but I got the hang of it and am havving a jolly old time. Quests are missable. The game warned me and any mistakes are on my own head. Only for one quest I had to check a guide, other then that the in game hints, as well as the pawn system, work wonder (the storeteller quest, waiting for that closed door was just very long, first three times I just left looking for other trigger to pull). By now I (think I) ended the first chapter and a whole nother world opened. It's probably not a game for everyone, but I am definitely liking it so much I want to recommend it.",1
Positive,"The game has everything Dragons Dogma fans wanted. And nothing for anyone else. I don't care if other people cant make it past 2 hours, that's their problem. Does the game need better optimization for being a triple A game? Yes. Does the game have Micro transactions? Yes. Will I down vote and try to make some arbitrary political statement about the climate of Video games? Hell no. I'm having fun and there's no buts. We can be critical without being overbearing. Now that's all I'm gonna say because it's my favorite game right now and I want to play it. And no it doesn't need to be my favorite of all time I'm enjoying it for what it is and when it is and I think more people should try that these days. Thank you CAPCOM.",1

Positive,I like the gameplay. Climbing on fantasy creatures to stab them in the eyes is all I need.,1
Positive,"Core gameplay is good, don't pay much attention to the micro-transactions.If you want a fix for the game running like shit when in towns, set the CPU priority of Dragon's Dogma 2 on your Task Manager to High.Buy it on sale or when most of the issues are fixed.",1
Positive,"If Baldur's Gate 3 is D&D 5e as a strategy game, then this is D&D 3.5e as an action game. It has a lot of issues and jank, but still manages to be a lot of fun. Each class feels like playing a different game, and combined with the pawn system makes it feel like you're going out in an adventuring party where you have to rely on each other.Don't buy the DLC, everything there is easily earnable in-game (or you could just mod it in)I get a solid 60 in town and 90+ in the field on max settings (RTX 3090ti, i9-13900KS), but overall the performance isn't great. There are some mods that hugely increase FPS (by ~25%) using DLSS if you have an RTX card.",1
Positive,"TLDR: I'm having fun. The game is good. The launch has been marred by people that cannot read.Dragon's Dogma 2 is exactly what I wanted. DD:DA but better.The world is so much larger, the Pawns seem a lot more fleshed out and combat is just as good as I remember DD:DA being if not better. Unlike a lot of games where I think a larger world is just filler or bloat, in DD2 it feels like every off-beaten path has something at the end of it.Also, stats normalise at Level 200. So if you're going to stick with DD2 for the long haul, don't feel the need to min-max vocations early. Play what you want, you'll be able to swap later on without any issue.Is performance an issue? Sure. My 5700x3D/6800XT/32GB RAM struggles in town at 1440p. It sucks, I hope it gets fixed but its not the end of the world for me.Re - MTX: All but 3 items (music pack/affection item/a camping kit that weighs slightly less) are readily available in game. No you cannot just buy fast travel for real money. You can buy Port Crystals but not Ferry Stones. Please stop saying otherwise. Get out of the reddit hive mind cesspool.Do I agree with MTX in a single player game? Nope.Has Capcom been doing with literally any game they can (e.g DMC5/RE games)? Sure have.Don't buy them.",1

Fans of the first will like the second, comes with lots of Quality of Life upgrades without destroying the core Dogma experience.I recommend the game, but only because you have a 2hr window to see how well it runs for you.More reasonably, I say you wait a week for a performance patch.",1
Positive,"This review is primarily for people who are Downvoting the game because of the microtransactionsFeeling robbed that the game is not complete or anything of the sort.So first things first Capcom is not new to microtransactions, If you played any of the recent highly upvoted Monster Hunter Games you know this. So having microtransactions in a Capcom game is to be expected.Second None of these Microtransactions are nessesary within the full game. They dont improve your the way you play your game neither are they Intended to BE in the game. They are there for lazy people that have a shit ton of cash to make their game easier. The entire game can be played as the DEVS intended without spending a single dime besides the main price. Fast travel was never a thing in Dragons Dogma, The whole game is based around you traveling across this big open new world from point a to point b. And fast travel will genuinely ruin that experience as even tho you take the same paths you have taken before you can find new things happening. There is a item that allows you to augment your character, Dont buy that cuss you can easily buy that in game and grind the required currency quite easily. All the purchasable currency makes you able to hire overpowered pawns very early on which defeats the entire purprose of the gameNone of these items will improve your gameplay experience! And are by no means nessesaryGood thingsCombat feels glorious, Taking out big monsters feels incredibly rewardingCharracter customization is interesting and allows for alot of diverse buildsThe Pawn system is very fun to play around with.It gives a way to interact with friends even tho you are playing a single player game.Being able to help them and other people while not having to directly impact the others game is a great concept.Negatives i had with the game so farNot being able to have multiple save files in a single player game is bothersome. The NPCs i so far encountered are a bit bland and dont hold as much story as for example Skyrim does.Its very confusing to differentiate a actual NPC and a Pawn. So I dont always know who to chat and interact with and who to ignore cuss its a pawn.Neutral thingsGathering quest isnt always obvious but, that also has its own charm to it.Tho pawns do help alot on that as they can point you in to the direction of new usefull information or quests.All in all this game is amazing, Capcom does a great job making new games.Genuinely not a fan of microtransactions but,There is no Gacha no randomization in the game, the costs of the microtransactions aint very high.And none of those are even benefitial to the game.They make your experience absolutely worse just highly recommend you dont use emThey are for the true casual players that want to just experience the story and nothing else and they can use them to make the game easier then it already is.",1
Positive,"I have finally finished my first playthrough of Dragon's Dogma 2 after around 90 Hours and i started NewGame+ Here is my full Review:The Game is gorgeous! I love ALOT of things about it.- The Character Creation is one of the best i've EVER seen. - The World is Huge and fun to explore- The Armor and Weapons are Cool- The Pawn System is amazing.- The Vocations are amazing, i love the Archer the most because of it's Agile and Nimble attacks. I use Warfarer to combo it with other armor pieces that i like.- The enemies While low in Variety At the moment are still fun to fight.I love that it feels like a D&D campaign everytime you set out into the world, every journey is different. I Lost count how many times i walked from BakBattahl to Venworth without Fast Travel simply cuz i wanted a adventure and see where it takes me.I ran into Little to no Issues, Performance is Good across the Board for me, even in the Capital Cities and i have a 5+ years old PC.Now I'm overwelmingly Positive, yet there is ofcourse some Negatives like the Microtransactions. They aren't huge GameChangers, By the time i finished with the Game i was Loaded with FerryStones and WakeStones anyway, I have Tons of RiftCrystals as i don't see the point of Hiring Higher Level Pawns, I Probably got Ambushed Once while Camping in my entire playthrough so my storage is full with Camp-Supplies. So you can do fine without purchasing anything in the game.As finale, that is probably it! I love the Game, I love the World, I feel Immersed in the game. They did a good job! And i'm Looking forward to what Capcom has in Store for this game as they'll continue Supporting the game. I'd be verry happy we get a DLC similiar to 'Dark Arisen' of DD1. Perhaps Bringing Necromancy back, some more endgame content,. Going for a NG+ Playthrough! Looking Forward to DD2's Future!",1
Positive,"2, . :1. .2. ( , ) 10 , - , .3. , ( Capcom )4. Customization( ) ( ) :1. ( ) 2. ( ) ( ) . , .What I want to say about Dogma 2, the game is very cool and thoughtful.The pros of the game are:1. Passing the mission is varied and creative.2. vast map ( yeah, it can be empty in some places) I for 10 hours which I have played has not yet reached the big city, you go like a path and then bang a small path somewhere will enter, interest takes over and you are already in a cave with a Troll in the embrace.3. Gameplay is interesting as in the first part, for example, to defeat the same Ogre or Troll you need to know where to hit and with what to hit him and constantly think and monitor the situation (the game does not forgive mistakes and Capcom too).4. Customization of the character and pawns is very advanced and flexible compared to the first part (I can be wrong because I haven't played for a long time). Minuses of the game:1. Obviously microtransactions (I don't see the point of introducing this into the game at all) 2. optimization of the game (this I think soon to correct with patches ) (this is a temporary disadvantage).I didn't notice any other disadvantages of the game. If you liked the short review of the game please put please like in advance thank you.",1
Positive,"In this review, I'll delve into the multifaceted experience of playing ""Dragon's Dogma 2,"" a game that has captivated my attention in various ways. It's not often that I share my thoughts on a game, but this title compels me to do so, given its mix of impressive features and some noticeable shortcomings.-The Good-Firstly, the game triumphs in its combat mechanics engaging and fluid, providing a satisfying sense of control and challenge. The expansive map is another high point, offering a stunning canvas for exploration. As I journeyed across this vast landscape, I found myself continually impressed by the detailed backdrops and visual splendor. Additionally, the dynamic movements and interactions of the NPCs add a layer of depth and realism to the world.- THE BAD -However, the game is not without its flaws. Questing can be a mixed bag at times intriguing, yet occasionally hindered by inconsistencies. A notable frustration arises from frequent interruptions during combat and exploration, with pawns and quest givers breaking the flow of action, often leading to unsolicited cutscenes. This disrupts the immersive experience one would expect from such a well-crafted world.Furthermore, despite being rated 'M' for mature audiences, the game's approach to adult themes, particularly romance, feels underdeveloped. The interactions lack the depth and authenticity one might anticipate, often culminating in simplistic sequences that don't align with the game's mature rating. This aspect feels like a missed opportunity to deepen character relationships and narrative immersion.Another point of critique lies in the game's environmental design. While some elements are meticulously crafted like the impressively detailed cooking scenes others suffer from a noticeable lack of diversity and originality. The repetitive use of textures and items, even in a large and varied world, can detract from the overall sense of discovery and wonder. It's perplexing to see such attention to detail in certain areas, yet a reliance on recycled assets in others.- Overall -In conclusion, ""Dragon's Dogma 2"" is a game of contrasts remarkable in its scope and design, yet hindered by certain gameplay and narrative elements. Honestly I would say give it a try, and use my pawn while your at it!",1
Positive,"Good game, i just love it",1
Positive,Despite some performance issues (which I expected given my specs) the game feels amazing to play so far.,1
Positive,"Bought the game expecting it to run like crap after all the negative review bombing and backlash, and that the MTX would be mobile F2P gacha levels.Well, the game is actually really fun. I have had zero performance issues or crashes in my first 10 hours. Steady 60 FPS even in the big town. Combat is fun, exploring has been tight tight tight with a ton of hidden stuff to find basically everywhere.Pawn system just as good and awesome as first game.The DLC/MTX is huuuuuuuugely overblown by review bombers and sensational news websites.Everything is very easily obtainable in game (The gaol key literally seems like a scam, you get one for free in jail and you can buy them ingame for 3k gold which takes no time at all to get. It costs as much as staying at an inn for the night. Unlimited number to purchase.)You get the fast travel items, the rez items, everything ingame and quite easily. I have several of each and imagine they get even easier as you get farther in the game.You can edit your character in the game, change your class as much as you want, etc.People complaining about one character slot, which is exactly how the first game was, and makes it so your choices actually matter. You can't reload and choose differently. If you want to make different choices, you gotta start over.Ignore the reviews, just enjoy the game. People out here eating up Helldivers 2 and then complaining about microtransactions.The game is fun.",1
Positive,"Awesome game, dumb community. Give me my clowns peasants.",1

Positive,"A long awaited sequel. The gameplay is all a fellow DDDA enjoyer would love. It improves on the first opus really well. The only issue right now is poor performance.People complaining about the micro transactions don't know the games, all the items are easy to get in game without paying. It offers pretty much nothing, but if people are willing to pay for those ""DLC"" and support the dev, sure why not! Won't change a thing on my playthrough.",1

Positive,"Hot garbage performance and iffy storytelling hinders this game so goddamn much, but it's an honest to god Dragon's Dogma game and that's all I ever wanted. Even now, as I am winding down from finishing the game, I can't stop thinking about going into NG+ to do all the side content I missed out on as well as thinking up all kinds of runs exactly like I do with DDDA. Very far from a perfect game, but it's practically perfect to me.",1
Positive,"I tried the first Dragon's Dogma years ago, but I never got into it and left after a few hours. In 2024, I gave Dragon's Dogma 2 a chance, and I'm having a blast. I spent like 74 hours on my first and blind run, trying to explore everything and complete as many side quests as possible but still missing a lot. And I didn't go to the True Ending yet. Some argue that the story can be concise, and that's indeed true if you head straight to the end. But Capcom has designed an expansive open world for players (like me) who enjoy exploration. There's a plethora of points of interest to uncover, including secret locations, dungeons, chests and more. In fact, Dragon's Dogma 2 is made for exploration. Futhermore, the camping system does contribute to immersion in Dragon's Dogma 2 (and yes, camping tools don't disappear after use!).The pawn system is amazing. You can recruit AI companions to accompany you on your journey. Your main pawn can be customized with special behavior and personality, in addition to character creation. Recruited pawns cannot level up, so you have to recruit new ones, which adds a good amount of diverseness. My character is a thief with my main pawn being a warrior, while I've recruited a mage and a healer.Dragon's Dogma 2 has a lot of classes (referred to as vocations in the game), ranging from starting vocations to advanced ones. The latter require specific quests to unlock them. The good thing is that you can change your classes anytime at the inn and try out other vocations. Even your pawn can change, although not all vocations are available to them. Indeed, being able to change vocations adds a lot of flexibility to gameplay, allowing players to experiment with different combinations and strategies.Combat is really fun. I love climbing on big creatures and putting bombs on their back.Visuals are quite nice, especially with mods. Towns and areas are really immersive ! As for the story, I won't spoil anything, but it's essentially about the relationship between you and your best friend forever, a big dragon.Regrettably, there are some deceitful aspects: I mentioned the world is huge, but it's overrun with too many monsters. The fast travel system is frustrating, demanding consumable and rare items for teleportation, and the necessity of another item to establish teleportation points. Needless to say, this teleportation point item is also scarce.Even they are 100% optionnal, I cannot endorse microtransactions in a single-player video game ; especially those offering advantages like fast travel. Dragon's Dogma 2 have only one saving slot, that can be problematic in some cases.Moreover, the performance on PC is underwhelming. Even with a high-end setup, you'll encounter issues, particularly within towns.Additional note : you should mod the game. There are plenty of mods that provide some Quality Of Life improvement. I made a small video about my top 5 mods for Dragon's Dogma 2.I do recommand Dragon's Dogma 2, it's an awesome RPG. And better once the game will be cheaper because the price right now (65 ) is a bit expensive. Also wait for performance patches.",1
Positive,"The wind is pushing me.Despite the rocky performance in cities (which I've been able to cope with just fine), this game has managed to be worth the wait. I highly enjoyed plugging 100 hours into this game and fully enjoyed every minute of it. Exploration has to be some of my favorite in games, though finding a hidden chest just to have a wakestone shard or a couple of potatoes does kind of suck.My only wish is that there was MORE, especially vocations. I think green and yellow could have for sure had some advanced versions without making them samey, but I suppose we'll see later on.",1
Positive,"I'll say this. There are performance issues, yes. But nothing so abysmal that you can't play at all. I'm playing at 1440p myself, game is mostly stable at 40-50 FPS. Not perfect, mind you, but I've seen so much worse. As for the MTX dilemma, sorry, but most of the items are obtainable in-game, and the game throws a lot of the currency at you, even early on. While I agree that the presence of MTX in single-player games is not something that we would want, nor likely need, these are not as scummy as in other games. Also, I don't believe so many people batted an eye when Red orbs MTX were available in DMC5, or in RE4 remake. Just saying. Overall, enjoyable game. Wait a bit if you must, for some patches, but a good game,EDIT (after finishing the game): In my opinion, it's well worth the money. Really a great game which does the first one justice and then some. Also, the performance issues were mostly fixed with the first update (also used the GeForce Experience suggested profile). TL;DR: Buy the game, enjoy, don't buy MTX (not needed at all).",1
Positive,"Rough around the edges, shipped with awful monetization, has the shackle that is Denuvo, and is quite unoptimized, but hey it's Dragon's Dogma. A buggy good game can be fixed.The framework's there, gameplay and voice acting are so far good enough to scratch that DD itch. I'm sure it'll eventually be good. I'd like to support the devs and tell their corporate overlords that the DD franchise is worth investing in.Recommending it for now solely on the merit of being Dragon's Dogma. May edit later with a more proper review.",1
Positive,"Yes, I know. Pay for RC if you want. Me? +Collect the materials like DD1. +Expanded Pawn utility. I like the quest setup for them that way players can request different kill types or items .+Not only is cinnamon bark good for making curatives? Its needed for equipment enhancements. Like that the like items are stacked nicely. Dangit, why no boar tossing?!I have my 2 hander. Need to hunt wabbits to upgrade my pawn's archer gear. They made the baseline pew pew stronger so I think thats why they merged some Ranger stuff into the base vocation. 2 archers firing away with me as the warrior + switching out a mage or thief makes for a fun combo.My 1080 TI is doing pretty good. The only bigger slowdowns is when I am in the main big hub so far.Edit: You can BOAR TOSS! It has to be via Simple Inclination Pawns!",1
Positive,"Game of the year material here. Don't listen to the hate.I do not support the microtransaction in a single player game. However, you don't need to pay a penny to use any item in the game. In fact you can get any item easily in the game. The microtransaction is for the lazy people who do not like to grind in an RPG (Then don't play RPG).The combat system is amazing and the pawn system is unique. The world is beautiful (you are beautiful for reading my review). If you keep exploring, then you will be rewarded for your time. Lots of hidden secrets, side quests and treasures.The only bad thing in this game is probably the story. But, this is a problem with most RPG nowadays. For me I prefer if the main character is a ""character"" and not someone with no personality who can't talk (The Witcher III is a good example of a good main character in an RPG).",1
Positive,Game is good cant say the same for the optimization lol,1
Positive,"Good game. Sadly it has some pretty big downsides: microtransactions in a singleplayer game, and Really bad performance. If your willing to power through these problems you will have fun. :D",1
Positive,the game ever,1
Positive,It's a new Dragon's Dogma.,1
Positive,"Game is janky AF but it's fun. Performance isn't great, and it for sure feels dated but IMO that's part of the appeal. Story is stupid but the combat and exploration is where the game is great. Pawn system is also neat. If you like RPGs and dragons might as well pick it up on sale.",1
Positive,"The game is fantastic, spent 24 hours playing in the first day and a half.Open living wold, everything has a weight to it that you don't get with most other open wold games.Explorations is great and has lots of varied and interesting side quests.Other then a bit of performance issues, and DLSS graphical issues runs fine.Didn't know there was mtx until i noticed other people complaining, didnt interfere with how i play at all.",1
Positive,"Review going into NG+: It's Dragon's Dogma 1, but better. If you played DD1 and didn't like it, you won't like this game. The microtransactions are all obtainable within the game extremely easily, so it's a non-issue in my opinion - I did not even notice there were microtransactions until I was halfway done with my playthrough and it was only because I saw people malding about it in another app. You can change your appearance for 500 rc in game - I had like 10,000 by the end of my playthrough and I was using it throughout the game to hire pawns slightly above my level. You can also change your appearance in NG+. I am a rabid fan of the series so it's been a 10/10 experience for me, but this doesn't mean there aren't things I think they can fix.The performance/optimization is just as bad as you've heard. I have a 13th gen intel cpu and a 2080ti and I got along at around 100 fps which dropped into the 50-60 fps range in densely populated areas while using DLSS. DLSS causes a noticeable blur at times, and imo scaling shouldn't be mandatory but right now it is unless you've got the newest gen hardware. The pop-in is HORRIBLE, nuff said. Random pawns solicit their services to you half the time you encounter them in the wild, which is annoying and immersion breaking. Voice acting is decent mostly, but the lows are very low. Also, you should be allowed to choose a whatever voice you want for your pawn regardless of their inclination.Would recommend if you liked the first game and have decent hardware. If you never played the first game, just know it's a unique rpg unlike anything you might be thinking of. It's not elden ring. It's not skyrim. It's not baldur's gate 3. If you didn't like DD:DA or your hardware is lacking - I'd definitely wait on it.",1
Positive,"I enjoying the game immensely, the only issue is the City performance could be a lot better. Everything people are complaining about for microtransactions are able to be purchased with Rift stones which you get by playing the game (mostly through the pawn system). The game is very similar to the first with better design all around, but this time, it's not 20 FPS like it was on my PS3. Here's hoping the end game has an everfall equivalent!",1
Positive,Running with no fast travel gets tiring soon.It's like ARMA for RPG players.Not everyone will like it.Bad CPU optimization.Don't care about MTX.,1
Positive,"Got the true ending. Game is awesome, no microtransations needed.",1
Positive,"To start off, there are some problems with this game. As of right now, there are PC performance issues that I am confident that the developers will work on. While the micro-transactions are annoying, they are basically an easy button; there is no reason to buy them, but if most of the other CAPCOM games can get a ""pass"", then I feel like this one should too.If you are a returning player, then you might feel a little too at home, as the director said that this is what Dragon's Dogma was supposed to be, so it is essentially a remake or reimagination.-{ Graphics }- You forget what reality is Beautiful Good Decent Bad Don t look too long at it MS-DOS-{ Gameplay }- Very good Good It's just gameplay Mehh Watch paint dry instead Just don't-{ Audio }- Eargasm Very good Good Not too bad Bad I'm now deaf-{ Audience }- Kids Teens Adults Grandma-{ PC Requirements }- Check if you can run paint Potato Decent Fast Rich boi Ask NASA if they have a spare computer-{ Game Size }- Floppy Disk Old Fashioned Workable Big Will eat 10% of your 1TB hard drive You will want an entire hard drive to hold it You will need to invest in a black hole to hold all the data-{ Difficulty }- Just press 'W' Easy Easy to learn / Hard to master Significant brain usage Difficult Dark Souls-{ Grind }- Nothing to grind Only if u care about leaderboards/ranks Isn't necessary to progress Average grind level Too much grind You'll need a second life for grinding-{ Story }- No Story Some lore Average Good Lovely It'll replace your life-{ Game Time }- Long enough for a cup of coffee Short Average Long To infinity and beyond-{ Price }- It's free!

Positive,Play if you want to know where the ladder is,1
Positive,Game requires some FPS improving bug-fixes,1
Positive,This game is brilliant though it does have some technical problems (particularly in the main city).Even high end HW will suffer in this area until Capcom sort the CPU utilization.It's fine with very high end (playable in the city),1
Positive,"I'd really like to give this game a negative review solely because of the MTX, the inclusion of which is incredibly shitty, especially for a singleplayer RPG.But everything else about the game is incredible, and contrary to so many other reviews, have had 0 performance issues or crashes in 56 hours of play.Also fuck Capcom and their greed",1
Positive,"Its another flawed Gem, just like the original Dragons Dogma. The game looks Beautiful but needs more optimization from Capcom.Combat is outstanding but needs a difficulty option and more enemy types.Dungeons are bland, exploration and the environments of the outside world carry the experience.The story is disjointed, however there is hidden and timed quests that give DD2 a unique feel. A substantial portion of the game is possible to miss on a first play through. Its a flawed, one of a kind gaming experience. If you can stomach DD2s shortfalls i think its worth full price.",1
Positive,"Played 30 hours so far, adventuring has been very fun, finding things for my friends' pawns and being shown the secrets they find is very cool! Level 8 Thief, Lvl 5 Fighter, Lvl 5 Archer at the time of this review. The story opens strong and the introductory plot already offers more than Game of Thrones/FFXVI. I noticed the micro transactions and while I was at first disheartened at their presence, the items for sale are very much available in game. For portcrystals are obtained via questing, and you still need ferrystones to even use said portcrystals. Play the game and have fun.",1
Positive,"This reviews are getting out of hand, the game is good, I recommend it to fans of the first, if you did not like the first one, then move along, now let us look at the complains.1. Bugs, sight, you know when game developers realize the could improve a game by pushing updates gaming has change, in the olden times, if there was a bug you had to eat it, like it, and move on, people are too attach to perfection, by the way no game is perfect, none, 0, zero, give me your so call perfection and I promise there is a flaw in it.2. Micro transactions,. what micro transactions, I feel people refuse to read now a days, all the items been sold are for convenience, they all can be acquired in games, please stop and read, or if you have issues reading take a college course, if you buy the extra stuff is on you, now show me the micro transaction that changes your game play so drastically, that is not available in game and I will tip my 18 inch rim hat to you.3. Technical issues (Frames), sigh, don't talk to me about frames, so far on my 40 years of life frames have made little to no consequence on the enjoyment of my games, and I play a sh** ton of games, I upgrade my PC when ever I have the money and time, and is not very often. At the end it all comes down to our own decisions, I like it, I recommended, be informed and make your choice.",1
Positive,"I'll preface this review with this: WAIT UNTIL THE OPTIMIZATION PATCH AND IGNORE ALL THE DLC WITH MAYBE THE EXCEPTION OF THE DD1 OST IF THATS YOUR THING, EVERYTHING ELSE IS EASILY OBTAINABLE IN-GAME JUST BY PLAYING.Dragons Dogma 2 is one of the most addicting Fantasy ARPG games I've played in years. It scratches an itch I thought only a new Elder Scrolls game might scratch while offering extremely engaging combat that feels weighty and nice. True to the dev statement, on foot travel is a massive part of the game and I have still yet to get bored of it with how much stuff you can discover just walking down a path. I feel like an adventurer playing this game and every hour feels like minutes.",1
Positive,"First: IT'S NOT PAY TO WIN, all items are obtainable in game, there are no pay walls. The things in the store.do not I repeat do not prevent you from anything. The items are not even hard to get in game. Now with that out of the way. It's a good game, which will surpass the first when more and more gets added. It is however a very demanding game, this game will test your system, it takes my 4090 with a 7700x Ryzen to push 60 fps in a town without dlss on max settings. They will patch the optimization I'm sure. Outside of large towns I'm getting like 120 fps and it's smooth the entire way. If you're having issues, just fiddle with the setting like a normal pc gamer. What I like the most? Is the pawn system. Pawns are so much more lively this time around. They banter and smack talk and actually actively try to help you. Even the run of the mill npcs have surprised form time to time. The second would be the world it feels lived in and there's a lot to see and find. They really took what made the last game good and dialed it up to 11. You will want to play this game, they'll patch out the bugs soon at any rate and I heard they're adding a restart button too. All is well, just have fun it's only going to get better.",1
Positive,"good fun with the combat and the exploration; the ""dlc"" items for $1.99 can be found/purchased in the game so I wouldn't pick on THAT. When the story can definitely feel incomplete and performance is so abysmal that I need FRAME GENERATION AT 1080p, the ""micro-transactions"" are not the problem at all.Still, I enjoyed it with all these flaws; I was personally generally pleased with DD2.Full review:",1

Positive,"Great game, ignore the babies crying over MTX",1
Positive,"People need to stop comparing this to DD1. Yes, it does rely on that base lore / world building, but it is it's own game with it's own themes and story and impact. Highly recommend playing it and taking your time to explore the world, talk to people, do side missions, and play it multiple times; that's what's always made Dragon's Dogma an amazing series.",1
Positive,"Good successor to the previous game, but still needs a bit of polishing.I hesitated a bit at first, because of the negative reviews regarding the microtransactions, but to be honest I didn't feel the need for them as it seems they are only for those that don't like to explore the map, or constantly want to be able to revive themselves.For example, I used only 3 lazarus stones during the whole play through on myself and 3 to revive NPCs, but found a lot more.Regarding the game itself, the classed are rather similar to the ones in the first game with a few changes, but they added a few good features. A few are still better against certain bosses.There are also random encounters like it could happen that suddenly a griffon joins a fight, as he was flying over your location.The music and voice acting in this game is high class, even though a few of the voice lines for your pawns get repetitive. Still, they managed to add a lot of comments from your companions there regarding a lot of quests, which makes them feel a bit more alive.The cutscenes are very nicely done and reflect your actual gear, which does rarely clip :)Regarding the world, it is nicely crafted, and doesn't feel out of place and fits the general setting of the story too. One bad point here is that the NPC should have more tasks to do during the day, a lot of them just stand around for a long time.Regarding the quests you sometimes have the option to clear them in different ways, and it felt refreshing, even when there are still a lot of gathering quests.There are also a lot of hidden ones and you need to listen to the npc, as some hidden information will not be found in the quest description and you don't have markers for everything.In the endgame you can get overpowered quickly, but maybe a dlc will bring some more variety there in the future.If you liked the first game, definitely give this one a try, as it adds a lot to the story and lore.Had 3 crashes so far, and needed around 45 hours to clear the game (with the true ending).Still missed exploring a few locations and did miss to unlock 2 classes.Regarding overall performance it should still be enhanced for the title menu and the gear menu, as its rather performance heavy.",1

Positive,"I won't defend capcom for their mtx bs, there are way to many when there just should be none. I am trying to look at the game without even paying attention to them and that's mainly what this review is going to be.Having played a good(15ish hours as of writing this) amount it's rather faithful to the original, and playing as all the different vocations all feel very good. The enemies were made a bit tougher, but maybe that's just because you can do so much more against them now. Once you get past level 10, you can practically beat any of the early encounters unless you heavily fuck up somehow.Story is about what I expected so far, I won't go to into details with it. They do always make you explore around the main hubish area just like the first game.Overall games pretty alright, if you want to be able to come into combat encounters and be able to approach them differently each time this games prob for you. There's also a shit ton to explore and collect, so people that like collecting everything will have their work cut out for them, I've only managed to explore less than 10% of the entire map and it's not like I'm not trying to. The only real gripe is the change in the loss gauge, in the original you could just use healing items to get it back up, now you are forced to rest. Be that camping or at an inn, it kind of pulls you out of the game for a bit like, ""Shit I now need to stop the exploring and fighting to rest."" lolEither way it's a good 8/10 so far and I might update this later when I beat the full thing. Fuck the mtx still, they shouldn't need to exist.",1
Positive,"Goblins arisen! Their kind hate ice and fire both!Edit after 50 hours played:This game is great, especially for those who fell in love with the first one back in the day. I can see the performance issues hindering it some, but the core game-play is just so satisfying. The beginning feels like a survival game, and you can end up in some very pulse pounding situations. As you fight and level up you can explore new abilities and classes to find your preferred method of monster extermination. Even though you switch classes your level carries over so the monsters that gave you trouble in the beginning will still be a breeze to deal with later on.I haven't gotten to the end yet, but so far my favorite thing to do is just wander off into the wilderness and stumble upon the encounters present in the world. The addition of camping is such a much needed improvement over the first one, that really fleshes out the exploration for me.The worst part of this game is the main hub city and quest givers. I can confidently say that I couldn't care less about any of these npcs. They all feel so fake and robotic, and the hub city makes my computer cry, so any quests focused in Vernworth were just the vernworst. It also felt like way more bugs occurred in the main city. All of the npcs randomly spawning in front of you was so jarring and felt unfinished. This games strengths lie in its untamed wilderness, so I was actually disappointed to see more civilization present in the sequel. The one saving grace is that you barely spend any of your time in the city, you can save anywhere and camp to restore health all over the place. You don't even have to go back to store your stuff because you can just load up one of your pawns like a mule, and then proceed to throw them into the nearest body of water. (all of their inventory goes back to storage) (you could also just tell them to go home, but lets be real)All in all, I have thoroughly enjoyed my time in Dragons Dogma 2 and I expect that I will for another 50 hours. Fingers crossed for a cool endgame like the last one, or a Dark Arisen-esque dlc expansion.",1
Positive,"Not far into the game but I am having blast! Story is throwing me for a loop, but in a good way. Graphics are nice too!Spent hours in character creation. and i mean. hours. Which that doesn't bother me as I enjoy creating characters. Which brings me to one of my downsides. one slave slot. Not a fan, but that is okay. Fall damage is challenging as well. Much more brutal than it was in the first.Other than that the game seems like its going to be great. For those that enjoy games with character creation a good story and exploration, Would highly recommend.",1
Positive,"EDIT :90 hours in and this might be the best game ive ever played. No matter where you look there is s*** to do and find, you never go looking somewhere and leave disappointed. Im totally off the deep end with this game. Unbelievable. Enemy variety changes with your level, starter zones remain dangerous no matter what stage of the game your in.Ive maxed every vocation and enjoyed every single one apart from trickster that can suck a fu**ing d*** boring ass vocation but the rest are fresh and entertaining.Writing this after smashing this game for 12 hours release day.Performance isnt awful, not the best but its playable without it really effecting my gameplay unless youre in a heavily populated area.Combat feels amazing, theres a nice weight to all the spells and abilities pretty unique. Things that i thought would be buggy like clinging onto monsters is totally seamless.Exploration is MASSIVE. I spent the majority exploring caves and killing stuff.Not sure why they put microtransacitons in tbh bit of a weird move but everything they sell i have got in game easily.Im gonna level each vocation and continute exploring.8/10",1
Positive,"This is great and immersive. I love having to figure out what to do and the surprises in this game keep you on your toes! The combat is easy to pick up and forgiving. The dynamics of battle is amazing. You can ignore all the MTXs, not needed, they are already in the game once you get going.",1
Positive,"Dragon's Dogma 2 does interesting things in a world that is enjoyable to explore but never really goes far enough in any area to be exceptional and has confused people into thinking it is more unforgiving than it is.You play as the Arisen, a character meant to battle a certain dragon and rule one of the main kingdoms while also having control over characters called pawns. Pawns are warriors that are said to have no personality or much in the way of reactions to others but travel around fighting hostile monsters, who exist to obey the orders of the Arisen, and who when killed seem to be transported to another place where they might can reappear later through riftstones (never mind that narrative, world design, and mechanics completely clash here as the personality thing is clearly not true and even narratively them going around themselves often defending people doesn't fit that either and it makes even less sense later on that they might allow themselves to be attacked or captured and moved around by random people, or what in the world Pawn Guilds are if pawns were incapable of doing or acting without the current Arisen). You create a main pawn alongside your character who is always with you and you can take two other pawns created by other players or by Capcom to join you in your journey. Pawns can play as six of the game's ten classes, have one of four different personality types that change what they say and some of their combat and exploration AI, and can be given one of a few different skills that might allow them to do things like speak another language so you can talk to certain NPCs or know the locations of rare crafting materials. As you travel the pawns will speak to you and amongst themselves depending on things like their personality, your location, the active quest or world situation, and their class choice which is nice but it does become clear fairly quickly that having some more conversation variety would have been a good thing. Pawns might congratulate or high five you as you walk by them after a battle. They can pick up materials and open chests on their own (with you having access to their inventories, though you can not take the equipment of your guests pawns into your own inventory). They almost always do a good job in battle, in navigating the environment, will often prioritize healing you or carrying another downed pawn to you to be revived, and in general, are probably a hell of a lot more competent than the average PlayStation stoner who doesn't even remember where he is in real life that you often get stuck with if you were playing with real people instead of NPCs.The entire world not revolving entirely around the player character is felt is felt at times and leads to more interesting world, quest, and combat design than it otherwise would have. Certain quests will give you different outcomes where characters can be saved or killed and character plots can succeed or fail. Characters in the world are each named and do their own thing throughout the day and night and if killed will remain dead unless you revive them with some slightly rare items that you can find in the environment. Pawns aren't the only characters who fight monsters as there are patrols of soldiers and mercenary/adventures that you can frequently run into on the roads fighting enemies and towns themselves can even be attacked where people and soldiers will join in fights against them. At one point a dragon landed in the capital city and was fight be me, my three pawns, another pawn or two who was walking through town but not in my party, a group of soldiers, and random people in the area who either fled or joined in the fight with it ending with the body of the dragon laying upright against a building with its wings spread out over merchant shop stalls, a guard standing on top of its body, and a random passerby stopping to ask ""what happened here"". And while NPCs can die, the game doesn't make it an overly annoying feature where everyone but you is pathetic, normal soldiers can often hold their own fairly well and do damage to enemies. You won't walk into town one day to find half the people killed because two goblins entered the area.Fast travel is less prevalent than in most games like this. Early on you will likely need to make trips walking to places and making use of campfires to rest to heal you and your pawns but you can also pay minor fees to ride oxcarts to larger towns that allow you to sleep in the back and hit a button to skip the journey (or to at least move on to a spot where you were attacked before you can get back on and continue on your way). Two of the towns have a portcrystal that you can travel to with the use of a rarer to find and expensive to buy early on ferrystone that will transport you, your pawns, and anyone following you for a quest or escort to that area. As you play you can find or be rewarded with mobile portcrystals that you can place in most areas that give you new fast travel ferrystone locations. The second half of the map has passenger and cargo lifts that go over areas of the environment that have to be cranked as you go by yourself or one of your pawns, this is slower going and frequently might see you attacked by flying enemies (who might grab and throw someone out of it likely to their death) and also requires to to wait to wheel a cart back to your location if it isn't at the spot you are trying to leave from but it is still a way to speed up travel a bit and something different for the game's world.Quest design can be fairly interesting as it often goes beyond just going to a spot and killing a monster or collecting an item and giving it to someone. There are multiple quests with different outcomes depending on who you give certain information to or how you interreacted with a certain scene or who you agreed with, you might be able to make forgeries of certain items to get a reward from multiple people or to trick people who want something that will be a danger to them (in one cases trying to pass a forgery off to a merchant that might very well know better creates another set of unique circumstances), you might have to dress in a disguise for some, not entirely well done, but different quests involving subterfuge and locating information. There a series of quests that can relocate people to other areas or even free a minor village from a corrupt overseer that has you fighting guards with them after finding their confiscated weapons or buying them new ones before they all relocate to another town. The only disappointing thing with the quest design is that there aren't more of them to give a bit more life to the larger number of named NPCs in the towns and there are certain things you can do that seem like they might lead to more quests later in another area or help an important character who might come back later for new quests or to aid you but this just doesn't really tend to ever happen.For all the people saying how complicated and difficult the game is, it ends up being very fair and helpful. Your allied pawns are strong and usually perform their roles very well and at times can be almost as strong as you (better if it's a sorcerer with the Meteoron spell). You can lose maximum health over time but this is a fairly slow process and there are camping spots to rest all over the place. Pawns can lead you to quest locations and goals if you take one with you that has done the quest already with their own master. When it comes to upgrading equipment you get full access to your storage while doing it so you don't have to go collect needed items you already own. Money is easy to get rendering things like the fast travel ferrystones extremely easy to get at replenished item shops, oxcarts can easily be taken between different towns-Full Review: https://www.backloggd.com/u/Kennan/review/1947267/",1
Positive,"This game is breathtakingly beautiful especially now that performance updates have made the game run quite smoothly ever since. There are still some growing pains as a franchise, but this is just the second installment. The attention to detail in the pawn system and play style is really what makes me keep coming back! The exploration is quite good as well, and I hope we get a DLC soon and maybe even a DD3 down the line!",1

Positive,fun game. I played it for more than 50 hours without getting bored. I've seen reviewers treat the game unfairly regarding in-game purchases. Whoever wants to enjoy does not need to pay. I have played the game for over 100 hours and I don't need to buy anything. My rating is 8.8/10,1
Positive,"Of all the games on Steam saddled with mixed reviews, Dragon's Dogma 2 deserves it the least. It is a masterful execution of the archetypal Fantasy Adventure, with all its foot travel and unexpected detours and cooperation with your fellows, and a triumph of video games as an interactive medium. The simple ability to pick things up, pick people up, throw things at people and throw people at things gets more mileage in DD2 than I've seen in all the games I've ever played combined, both in and out of combat. I once was presented with a stubborn NPC who refused to meet with the NPC I was helping. and so I picked up NPC B and hauled her over to NPC A, and the quest was checked off my list. Speaking of quests and NPCs, the characters in this game are admittedly pretty flat, but they're all charming enough to make an impression. The pawns- while they can get grating- are almost always delightful in how they chat with you and each other, and how they interact with their surroundings.I think the primary weakness of the game is that the combat just isn't challenging. There's around three enemy types that ever really tried to kill me, and I shrugged off what should have been infuriating levels of stunlocking (from wolves and bandits in particular) just because there wasn't any damage backing it up; it just made the fight longer and provided some slapstick to laugh at in the meantime. Thankfully the combat is still loads of fun, due to the aforementioned lifting and throwing, as well as a surprising attention to detail in things like elevation and whether or not somebody's wearing a helmet altering the flow of combat. The class system, too, is extremely satisfying. Freely switching between different playstyles while collecting augment skills with which to slap power bumps and quality-of-life improvements (e.g. greater lantern illumination, slower stamina drain while climbing/tackling opponents) on my favorite classes is just fantastic.In summary, DD2 is a true adventure. Assemble a band of weirdos, journey out to meet a whole world of weirdos and do weird tasks for them, and beat up hordes of leathery, feathery and scaly weirdos in order to save that world. Despite how simple and played-out the premise sounds, there's really no other game like it.Except for DD1, I guess, which I will buy as soon as it goes on sale again. Please, Capcom. Please.",1
Positive,I made a review in video here if you're interested: it s a very good fantasy sandbox with tons of creativity and exploration bogged down by crappy performance and the decision to put in meaningless one time purchase microtransactions that made everyone literally foaming for no reason. It might not be for everyone but everyone should try it if only to experience a different way of making things than the usual AAA openworld garbage that we re used to.,1
Positive,"Genuinely one of the best games I've ever played, was worth waiting a whole decade for the sequel, I've used the same pawn as i have in DD1 so the bond I have with him is way too strong and let me tell you if you have maxed out affinity with your pawn, the end of cycle ending is different and not gonna lie, it made me cry hahahaha I highly recommend this game, you genuinely won't regret it, if you are new to the series, it might take some time to get used to it, but after getting hang of it, you will love it <3",1
Positive,"DD2 has one of the most annoying reasoning why one would give it a worse review than expected: Due to easily missed opportunities. Things that DD1 with BBI had already established, have been discontinued for whatever reason and it feels like the devs (or direction) tried to ""invent the wheel"" anew. So in no particular order whar irks me:- fewer skills for the vocations due to a new gameplay system, which then again is hard to put as a pure negative since it does work really well within itself (big winner of this system are warriors, though, while mages/sorcerers are losing in their viability due to missing spells)- fewer items in general (no more bottles or airtight flasks or potent greenwarish etc.)- what feels like fewer ""hidden"" spots or discoveries to make; there are still plenty but they feel more hinted at due to pawns pointing them out- fewer weapons and fewer weapons with magic effects (there's no GS with a magic effect)- some enemy variations missing (no hydra, evil eyes, walking armour or mimics ), although this is slightly offset by new enemies (slimes, minotaurs, medusa, more variations of goblins, harpies and lizards)- some of the aforementioned new enemies are just fought once during the game- a main story that is okay-ish in the first 50% but then loses track of itself entirely later on as if there are missing a bunch of quest steps in the middle (then again, DD1 was not so different in that regard: basically going Arisen from village-> arriving in Gransys -> joining the Wyrm-Hunt -> uncovering some hooded terrorists -> sudden dragon fight -> hole in the world/endgame )- no hand-gear slot, only one gear-slot for leg and torso armour, resulting in less variety for ""fashion dogma""- resistances to status effects due to capes and armour resulting to actually very little to the overall resistances if not for certain rings, that will grant immunity- overall what feels easier after the first 30-40 levels with little change afterwards- what feels like fewer uses for forgeries - most weapons and gear is from shops, so money is more of an issueAnd yet, despite all that, it is hugely entertaining because the core of it - the exploration and a certain ""grittiness"" to the world (e. g. relying on a lantern in the night instead of having a constant background radiation of light) - are working really well. Also:- all vocations feel much more viable and different than in the first game, making for a smoother experience, regardless of the choice (although, again very much like in DD1, not all vocations are absolutely equal and some make the game even more easy than it already is . MA )- stumbling upon quests is a rewarding reward for exploration or simply visiting a place multiple times- a seamless world with plenty of caves, hidden treasures and verticality- sidequests, which feel like they have impactful different ends depending on decisions made- the whole pawn-system being overall improved in all aspects and being also a kind of difficulty slider, too (depending on whether goes with the full party of fpur or deciding to take less and trying to make do with curatives instead of a mage for example)- a quite thorough character creator for both the MC and also pawns - if one has the ability and creativity to match- a not that often seen and also well used display of ""archaic English"", creating through this alone a nice medieval atmosphere- laddersSo, despite the difference in the amount of points made above, it is a game and world where one can get lost into for quite some time if taking the dive and being able to take the game as is.(Not touching much upon the technical aspect, because that seems to vary wildly. My setup is far from ideal with an i7 9700k, RTX 2700 Super, 32 Gb RAM, 1080p resolution - no OC - and mostly medium to high graphic settings - no RT - but I had just one crash up until now and while 60 fps was mostly possible in caves, it was never any issue whatsoever anywhere else while still looking plenty good to me.)",1
Positive,"Finished my first playthrough (loved it), and discovered after the fact that I still had not seen many of things this game has to offer. I had not explored as thoroughly as I thought I did so I missed tons of stuff.I will be starting my second playthrough and this time I really will discover everything.This game has a lot to offer. It is great in many aspects.Outstanding combat and gameplay. Truly peak gaming. There are moments of epicness that happen organically while you explore its vast world.The story is good too, however it could be better in some ways.First act sets up great political intrigue that sadly its not built upon in the second act, changing the main focus of the story into other direction.But the story still has good surprises for those who want to see it to its completion.I recommend this game highly.",1
Positive,"Short and to the point: Skyrim has been my favorite game of all time, until now.Most, if not all of the neg reviews were about micro transactions, however, I didn't even know this game had them until I saw it in a video review. You have to be looking for them, the game never puts it in your face. Additionally, anything they sell, can be obtained in the game. So I'm not sure how that was such a problem for anyone.The game itself, is easily the best combat in a game I have ever played. The graphics and animations are outstanding. And the attention to detail, is simply crazy. I also have had no performance issues, but I have a decent computer so I may not be the best judge of that.All in all, I literally and genuinely give this game a 10 out of 10.",1
Positive,"I doubt anyone ever really reads reviews but I just want to get this out of my chest. This game helped me forget about reality for a moment. Hard mode in this game is way more manageable than life outside gaming, at least you could save to a checkpoint and retry again, unlike in real life where I constantly live and dwell on regrets. Idk why I'm feeling this way, but these past few weeks it felt like my life had no meaning and no direction, to the point where I just wanna disappear but stumbling upon this game and playing it made me feel like I had some inkling of purpose to still breathe. RPG games like these just makes me forget about my problems in real life and helps me pretend to be something with purpose. I sound like an idiot right now but I have no one to talk to and I feel like just breaking down at any moment, sharing this to strangers in the internet feels like a bit of pain eased off me although I just wanna sob while typing this.I'm sorry for the depressed ranting, but if anyone wants to play this game, I highly recommend it.",1
Positive,"- Great combat, flows well and the combos you can get sometimes for example i play ranger so when my pawn sends them flying in the air you can get in a kick in air and do a back flip and get a shot off after in air or i shot a tarred arrow at a enemy and my pawn use fire to set it a flame or you can climb up on a cyclops stand on top of their head and fire arrows in its head you feel like legolas in the Oliphaunt scene, i love the pawn system there is nothing like giving a high five to the pawns after a big battle.- Immersive exploring, i get the same feeling as when i played skyrim for the first time.- Story is okay i have not finished it yet.- Side quest is great so far.- Performance is not great, i get like 45-60fps outside of citys but in the citys i get like 25-30 fps which is not great and should not be acceptable on release, but capcom said they are working to fix this.- Microtransactions is not needed you can earn everything in game by just playing the game, but i wish they did not exist to begin with.",1
Positive,"Recommended! Builds on the first game with improved gameplay and a rich world. However, there are occasional performance issues to be aware of. Overall, it's a solid pick!",1
Positive,"micro transaction items are available in game so \_( )_/ game gets choppy in high population areas, otherwise is finefun combatmid story",1
Positive,"Game is very enjoyable to play, I give it a 6.5, maybe 7/10. Hard-carried by the combat and exploration, and pawn interactions are just fun. Story and non-Pawn character interactions however fell very flat and there's a point where it became clear the game was rushed. 1. Combat. The way you can engage with certain enemies and the environment, the classes and skills are all fun to play and bring different stuff to the table. Some of the boss fights are very memorable.2. Exploration. Almost every nook is worth looking into, finding chests, or valuable items, or seeker's tokens in the wildest places. Going in blind and just seeing what's around every corner felt very rewarding.3. Pawns. I was easily attached to my goofy main pawn that my wife helped me create, named Beans. Being encouraged to cycle out recruited pawns, seeing other players' creations, the banter among the differing personality types. Telling stories of some of Beans' exploits as a Straightforward pawn to friends that play.1. Style. Every RPG is all about the drip of course and this game is no exception. Good selection of capes and the vocations all have very clear themes. However, it did seem clear that the skimpy outfits (that favor women body types) were a bit pushed; you'd see many folks' pawns in them, mostly because lewd but partially because they even had decent stats. I'm no prude but it didn't leave much variety.2. Dragonplague. It's a bit of a boogeyman because it can absolutely wreak havoc on your save, and this might be a polarizing opinion, but seeing the memes and posts about people yeeting their pawns into the ocean because they looked tired or made a rebellious remark is peak entertainment. I do wish it could be a little more clear when it happens than it already is, though, and get a way to be rid of it without having to forfeit the pawn or spread it to someone else's game.3. The Sphinx. So much work was put into everything about her, and it shows. I wish other areas of the game had this much time spent on them, especially with the Sphinx being as far out of the way as she is.4. The first half of the story. Lots of political intrigue, secrets, interesting characters and narratives being set up.Editing to add:5. The post-game /true ending. Kind of an odd bell-curve with how the second half of the main story found its way in the what I disliked section. While it doesn t tie up every loose end, it does offer a more triumphant ending and interesting view into the workings of the game world and mythos.1, Travel. I was mostly fine with running back and forth and relying on oxcarts most of the time, and I was grinding out every vocation anyway so the XP was nice. Sometimes I'd find something new that I hadn't seen before, or wasn't a Mage/Sorcerer and could now levitate and reach something new, or had a new pawn tell me about something they'd seen in another player's game. I did find it strange that in the main story there are only two permanent Portcrystals (waypoints) and they're a stones throw from each other. You have to plant the others you want. I do see the value in ferrystones being very limited with the world being so interesting in most cases, but I also understand why the travel is so polarizing.2. Enemy variety. Among smaller enemies you have saurians, goblins, harpies, wolves, and humans. Then about three or four variants/recolors of some of those that behave similarly but maybe have poison or lightning. Fighting the big enemies was the most fun but after a few dozen cyclopses and griffins, it could have been a bit more varied. There are other enemy types at night, but skeletons and zombies are practically just humans. The bigger enemies like Wights and Dullahan are a bit more interesting, at least.3. Dungeons. Very basic cave, crypt, or castle-esque layouts for most of them. I still enjoyed exploring them and finding stuff, and hidden pathways and shortcuts, and fighting tough enemies, but aside from different enemy types populating them they definitely blend together. Could have used more puzzle elements for unlocking doors and the like.1. The second half of the story.** All that setup and all those characters just seem to fall flat after a certain point then next thing you know, you trip over the end of the game. This is where the game feels rushed, like it needed just another several months in the oven.EDIT: updated, see what I liked section2. Relationships. The affinity system is every bit as crude as it was in the first game, and companionship with any non-Pawn NPC is extremely two-dimensional. Then there's what the game believes is your ""Beloved;"" this is simply a measure of your highest affinity NPC and how recently you've spoken with them. If you have your eyes on a particular NPC for your Beloved, I advise against doing too many of the random escort quests that other acquaintances can give you, because if it gets high enough it won't matter what quests you've done for who or how many of what gifts you've given them.1. Performance was definitely spotty, particularly in Vernworth. A patch improved it considerably but my gosh was it rough. At least out in the wilderness where most of the combat takes place it was pretty good, so this wasn't the dealbreaker for me that it was for others, personally.2. The cash shop. Come on, guys. Copping out with ""you can earn all the items in-gaaaame"" sure but some stuff like Wakestones and Ferrystones are particularly tough to come by, so just putting them up to see what kind of hand-wringing you can do and squeeze a few bucks out of people that don't know better just simply isn't a good look and Capcom deserves to be dragged for it. Middle-earth: Shadow of War is, to me, one of the better single-player action games out there, but it's going to be remembered by most gamers for having lootbox microtransactions for in-game items.",1
Positive,"I wish I could add neutral review for this one. I haven't played the previous installment, but it feels like a mix of Monster Hunter and Elder Scrolls to me.First of all, the Character Creator is beautiful and very detailed, and don t be fooled - you don t really need anything from the online store. You can easily get tons of Rift Crystals just by playing this game! Create your Main Pawn and let him work for others or look for Broken Rift Stones.The Pawn system overall is very unique, and I am enjoying it, but I would not mind building deeper connections with my party. Having more meaningful talks or special pawn side quests would definitely enrich the whole experience. I would also not mind having an option of finding a few story-related Companions during my gameplay that I could add to my party if I wish.The world - I absolutely love it! The sense of adventure is thrilling and refreshing. Exploration of every nook and cranny and the day/night cycle the game provides are truly masterworks. Night time for sure feels dangerous, and it s just a delight to go and explore the city surroundings just to be annihilated by a random roaming Cyclops.The combat system is definitely interesting, but as a story-focused player, I don t care that much about fights. They are more of a secondary thing for me, but still, it s a fine experience. If combat is the main thing for you, this game will be a bullseye. I would expect a greater variety of enemies, though. New zones are basically filled with the same but more powerful variations of creatures, which is a shame (as we already have a nice and diverse world around).The story feels like a classic fairy tale about a lost crown, power struggles, and a pinch of deception. Nothing jaw-dropping, but an enjoyable ride.At this moment, I encounter only one bug (connected to the side quest) but no problems with optimization here.From weird bothering things:Items - I noticed my equipment is filled with junk, potions, and spells I didn t use even once because I never felt like I needed them really. I just stashed them in a chest and forever forgot about them, which makes me think the overall selection and utility of items could be much better.Photo mode - It s great the game provides it, but it would be nice to have horizontal and vertical camera movement. This basic thing is not implemented, which is just annoying.It's an interesting game with a huge focus on combat and exploration, but it definitely has some flaws and could be much better when it comes to story and quests!",1
Positive,79 hours still on my first run. Truly the game of all time. Will do 2nd run ASAP,1
Positive,"This is a particularly difficult game for me to write about because I want to greedily compare and contrast every ballhair with the first title s, just so I can diagnose exactly where my issues with it lie - why a game that is functionally so similar in DNA to one of my all-timers doesn t hit the mark. Personally speakin, the long & short of it is that Dragon s Dogma 2 is something of a sidegrade to the original title that distances itself too much from what I found spectacular about it to begin with. Possibly my favourite element of Dragon s Dogma 2 is one that could be felt from the moment you first gain control of your character. There s a palpable heft to character locomotion, complimented by the multilayered textuality of the land itself & the threats of wrong turns into the unknown or slipping off a slick cliffside to your untimely demise - it leans wonderfully far into the concept of traversal being a battle unto itself. As was the case with DD1, being tasked to travel from safety to a marker deep into the fog of war is never a simple request. Goblins, ogres, harpies, and whoever else decides to grace you with their presence are waiting in the bushes to act as regular speedbumps to be carefully considered and planned for accordingly.Where DD2 slips at this for me is in how little it reciprocates for what it demands. This is a sequel that has ballooned itself in scale to a dizzying near 5x the original map s size, but hasn t developed the enemy roster nor the environmental design acumen to make use of it. Take for instance that DD2 has fifty caves strewn around its tectonic world map, and I don t think a *single one* is as impressive as one that could be found in DD1. Where the caves/dungeons in DD1 were concerned, there would be special objectives relevant to the overall story, a person you were going there on behalf of who represented a town or group, they would unlock shortcuts for faster world traversal and upon repeat visits you d notice the location s role in the world change for the denizens. They would be densely designed so that every corner was worth being scanned to the best of your ability for pickups, shortcuts, levers, climbing points - lending to the almost DnD-esque adventure core followed passionately by the game s design. Hell, the locales would generally sound and look different too, built to purpose so as to become plausible enough to justify their utility in the world and lend credence to exploring them.Compared to that, DD2 has shockingly little of this. Its myriad nondescript caves wallhugging the world could scarcely be five prefab rooms tied into a loop to house a few potions, or some equipment you could find at a store. No unique gimmicks or trials, only populated by a handful of gobbos and maybe a midboss as a treat. I feel that Dragonsbreath Tower was supposed to act as something of a callback to Bluemoon Tower from DD1 - it being a perilous journey across a handful of biomes towards a crumbling hanging dungeon that houses a flying peril, but it s so bereft of pomp and confidence. A truly memetic core routine that made me think less of adventures and more of waypoints and upgrade materials. I want to use a Neuralyzer to remove BotW shrines from the face of the earth. And god why is none of the new music good.DD2 implies at a big story, but to me it felt like nothing came together. I had no idea who anyone was supposed to be beyond Brant, Sven and Wilhelmina. DD1 s progression from Wyrmhunt -> Investigate the Cult -> Kill Grigori -> Deal with the Everfall -> Confront the Seneschal was great, and throughout all of that you kept up with characters like the King and got to see his downfall. The writing and delivery of the cult leader and Grigori himself far surpasses anything in DD2, despite having very similar subjects. Outpaced by DD1 in setpieces and pop-offs and thematics. There's barely any antagonistic people in the game and once you get to Battahl it feels as though the game trails off like it s got dementia.It's a completely different kind of design that, sure, encourages player freedom - but communicates it in this really loose way that I just don't care about. I spent much of my playthrough having no idea what I was doing besides wiping off the blank smudges of world map. What expounds this problem is that quest discoverability is astonishingly low here, oftentimes made worse by restricting itself to AI astrology, time of day, relationship levels (?). The duke could stand to commission a farcking quest board imo! I won t kid myself and say that the quests in DD1 were even a bronze standard, but they worked and communicated exactly what they needed to do while also leaving open ends available for interpretation. But in DD2, they re just awful, I absolutely hated the experience of trying to clear up Vermund s quests before pushing Main Story progression and at this point I wish I cared as little as the game does. What need is there for almost all of them to have a return to me in a few days component in a game with such limited fast travel, do you want me to throw you into the brine? Frankly the game is never as interesting as when you're doing Sphinx riddles.Combat s good enough, I do enjoy how the interplay of systems would present the player with all sorts of unique situations, but even these can and do begin to feel samey when a very slim enemy pool on shuffle. What makes these emergent conflicts even less impressive to me is how I can't help but feel as though the ogres, trolls and chimeras in particular have had their difficulties neutered. The hardest time I had with the chimera was during a sidequest where you had to get the poison-lover to be doused in chimeric snake venom. They're barely a threat otherwise, and can either be chain stunlocked with well-placed shots or slashes, or get too lost in their own attack animations to really hit anyone. Comparing these enemies to DD1 where climbing was far more effective at dealing damage encouraged the player to get real up close to them and it felt like their AI knew how to deal with that. Like when I fought the Medusa it felt like they didn't have any idea where the party even was. I think if the hardest encounters the game has to offer is Too Many Goblins we have a problem. (Dullahan is very cool though)I m not miffed no matter how miffed I sound. When do people like me ever get sequels to games they love? I ll tell u dear reader it s Never. Dragon s Dogma 2 is full of wonder & delight and I think anyone less fatigued by SCALE and SANDBOX than me has a home in it. I feel a little left behind, having spent 12 years wasting away in the waiting room rotating in my head the concepts DD1 confidently wields, and its further potential as a foundation for a sequel. A game that was absolutely 'for me', course correcting into sick-of-this-already airspace. I ll be excited to see whatever news, expansions or the like the future holds for DD2. Right now, though? I think DD1 has a stronger jawline.",1
Positive,"Absolutely love the exploration and world in this game. The environment is beautiful and a real pleasure to travel around. The combat could get repetitive at times, but with all the different Vocations to fight with there were so many ways to approach every fight. At 45 hours I still have a lot left I want to get done in this game, I'm going to be at it for a while and loving every minute!You can view my entire review here:",1
Positive,Love it. get good. Waste your life.,1
Positive,"Exploration and combat are fun, romance sucks, run on low to medium low graphics to make sure your PC doesn't melt. Wish I could run on higher settings but the game still looks good even on lower settings.",1
Positive,"I mean.this is a nice game but far from great. The combat is okay, the story is okay, the exploration is okay. Nature looks great, the world feels alive-ish but thats at the same time also the most well done part of Dragons Dogma 2, especially exploring at night is well done and really cool. There are also annoying parts like the repetitive banter of the pawns. Fighting is exciting but also often quite chaotic as hell and often more distracting than welcome. It does have a lot of kinda original gameplay mechanics like the already known pawns, wakestones yada yada but they are kinda only there and dont enrich playing that much. If you like fantasy and RPGs, you will like this but we have seen much better.",1
Positive,"The gameplay and combat is very fluid and feels impactful. Gorgeous game with a great story, although the main quests are not that long, a lot of the side quest are great and the open world feels very lived in and doesn't seem empty like some other big open world titles. Many quest have multiple outcomes with unique ways you can solve them, I never felt limited in the game as I often would ask myself if something would work and it does.The Normal Ending seemed mid but the true ending is amazing, giving another 4hrs of content for an endgame that wrapped up the game perfectly!Thou art Arisen and the world is yours to do as you please.Note on item shop drama - These were in the other games as well and are not meant for normal players as you can easily get everything you need through playing normally. Who they are for are the whales in the community that just want to get things a little quicker because they can and have the disposable income. This in no way effects gameplay and I personally never even thought of the item shop while playing this game or the other Dragon Dogmas",1
Positive,"Incredible game, and an advice for new players: ""Do not do the main missions at the beginning, explore the world first and do a lot of the side missions"".",1
Positive,"One of the best 7/10 games you will ever play. Probably a good idea to wait for the remaster/DLC version like Dark Arisen for Dragon's Dogma 1. Really, really needs another performance pass or three. Somewhat hard to recommend for $70, makes a lot more sense at $40. Good ending. Ultimately recommending, but maybe wait on purchasing.",1
Positive,"Fun story.So my pawns and I took an oxcart north to deliver a letter. Exactly half way between the two cities, the oxcart was attacked and destroyed. Checking my inventory, I found I had packed no camping kit. It was relatively early in the game, about level ~level 18. Night was falling, so the party hoofed it all night back to the city. The mayhem that ensured over the next 45 minutes left the 4 party members with at most 1/4 of their normal health bars as usable. When the sun peaked over the mountains with the city just visible over the last hill, I knew they had made it. Barely. When one final small skirmish just before the bridge into the city was won, the warrior pawn in the party stuck her hand out in the air and as my character walked past, the animated characters gave each other a high five. What nice attention to detail by the developers to put a stamp on that moment. Pawns do this often after fights, but this time it was significant. That almost hour long trek back to the city at night through 2 cyclops, 2 ogres, 1 griffin and the horde of dead that come out at night, without dying, was the most fun I've had in a game in the last decade. Then remembered the quest, deliver a letter. I delivered it and the man said thank you. The quest ended. That story was to make a point about this game. Quests in this game are not the adventure. When something goes wrong on that quest, and it sometimes will, that is when you will thank other players you never see for creating strong pawns that can overcome these moments. You simply cannot script these kinds of experiences into a video game. I've appreciated the game environment for what it is designed to be, a sandbox for things to go wrong so you can have these kinds of adventures. This is why fast travel is limited. I even had a ferrystone in my inventory that could have ported me back to town, I knew better than to use it, the fun was about to begin. MINOR ANNOYANCES-There have been a few times I noticed the frame rate dip in the city, but combat is fluid and smooth.-I had to go looking for the micro transactions, you click an option near the bottom of the main menu.If that story sounds like fun, you'll like the game. If not, you will likely get frustrated with it.",1
Positive,"Very good. I was unhappy with the game a few times but it was all stuff I could shrug off really.This may be the only open world game that I like. My negatives are :0. AT THIS POINT WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO HAVE MULTIPLE PROFILES/SAVES. I feel so bad for people with kids who want to play it aswell so they end up sharing a character (although that could be fun I suppose)1. No easter egg object/location/interaction which included the DD:DA Coils of light ost (Very easy add. Eternal return and all that)2. No hard mode or some equivelant challenge where there's no storage or something like enemy stat boosts and less xp gain. I'd say the game was only difficult on the first appearance of each of the bosses, after the 1st one they went down quick as new weapons and enhancements happened.3. Less ability slots feels bad. I almost want to try the mod that lets you have all abilities active.4. Pawn inclinations limited. Dark Arisen had specific inclinations for staying far/near to the party for example and wasn't linked as Kindhearted for staying nearby AND assisting with stuff. In DA it would be Guardian and Medicant. Less control over pawn behaviour leads to not really feeling happy with any choice unless its more of a priority on positioning than the other behaviour.5. Vocation unlocks don't persist to a new save game but you can start ng+ with all items and unlocks. Power creep and progression is a huge part of fun in RPG's6. Warrior feels pretty damn clunky against most of the movesets of enemies (could be a skill issue)7. Stat gain is still weighted on the vocations you levelled up with, so it can lead to underpoweredness or overpoweredness. Instead of just having the stats shift at a 80% rate to the vocation you switch to. I wanted to level all my vocations to max so I had access to all the augments and it was an absolute slug because I didn't plan on doing that. Played fighter for 60% of the game8. Thief and Sorcerer too strong. Archer boring, magick archer OP and boring (but also chill), doesnt have half the skills from Dark Arisen, Fighter Warrior and Mystic spearhand too weak. I didn't try out Trickster.9. No Bitterblack Isle-esque location, and no way to limit your levels so you dont overlevel and one tap everything.10. The boss enemy types felt way too few and far between and lacking in variety. I was wondering the entire game through where the hell the medusa is or where the chimeras are hanging out. You won't care about these things, probably. And possibly they will be added in the future.Best open world game I've ever played, but playing on ng+ leaves me not giving a fuck about chests and side quests. Maybe a new save will change that.",1
Positive,"TLDR: Still haven't beat the story at 40 hours, the performance isn't that bad, the MTX isnt pay to win or EA/Activision/Blizzard standard. If you are on the fence pick it up on a sale. It's worth it as is. UPDATE1: 60 hours in and still have not completed the story.UPDATE2: Finally beat the game, end game is a little lack luster, but it aint hateful, still worth buying.Don't let those other reviews fool you this a pretty fun game I'm 40 hours in as of this review and I still have not beaten the main story too busy exploring and looking for things to fight and boxes to loot, there are definitely some issues that hopefully will be fixed soon. I think some of the performance issues some people have are a little exaggerated for the hype or are running 4K everything maxed and getting mad they don't have 100fps I don't have the highest end of components but it runs just fine for me at 1440p max settings, DLSS off and RTX off. Not saying there's not some issues, cause there definitely are.The issues I've noticed have almost been exclusive to the first big city, and Capcom have said they're working on it. Entering the city can cause some pretty nasty stutters for a couple seconds but it clears up pretty quick. There seem to be some areas around the world that have some LOD issues that cause some of the same frame stuttering. As for the MTX as much as i hate MTX as a whole, the ones for this game are a lot less egregious than other games. Just about everything on the current DLC list can be found in game pretty early. The ""fast travel DLC"" is just an additional item that lets you place it to create your own fast travel locations it also doesn't function if you happen to not have any Ferrystones, it is also FAR less fun to fast travel in this game. None of the MTX are pay to win, and a decent number of them you get if you purchase the digital deluxe edition. The Wakestones or what ever they're called, are just an extra life or revive for an NPC if you desire to revive someone. The thing that lets you remake your character can be bought in game.",1
Positive,"The game is still in need of some polish, but overall a joy to play, especially for fans of DD:DA.",1
Positive,"Disclaimer : Slight Spoilers (nothing important) ahead and major dissection of this game in its entirety.Long version:When i first ventured into the world of DD2 the game did a great job of introducing me to some of its core features and instantly got me hooked. As someone who was deterred from playing the first game for longer than a few hours due to its age I can confidently say that I was mistaken for not playing the first iteration of this series due to how good of an experience DD2 was. The game did an amazing job of keeping me entertained throughout my travels of this beautifully crafted world. Everything from the wide range of enemies I was encountering and the caves i was exploring was executed extremely well. I would like to say that the quantity of enemies in certain areas was excessive however that in itself made for a more intense and immersive experience. The NPC encounters were in my opinion few however very well done and their quests, no matter how mundane, were fun to do since you would always uncover something new and exciting while doing them. All of the vocations in the game were well balanced (except form the Trickster) and never made me feel like there was an optimal one to go for since they all have their advantages and disadvantages which made for a more pleasant gaming experience overall since it felt like i wasn't shackled to one playstyle but could adopt one that was most suitable for me. As for the bosses in the game, they were very well made and fun to fight against since each one had their specific weakness which was fun to figure out on my own. The gameplay overall was great, not much else to say there, from the weapons to the pawn interaction to the focus being on traversal by foot and exploration left not much else to be desired. Through exploring the world you come across very interesting creatures and storylines which are not required for finishing the game but add a extremely welcome depth to the game which was definitely a major factor that contributed to my enjoyment of this game. The resting system , the idea of finding quests on your own and making your own story, the exploration element, the simple yet intricate combat, the scarcity of certain items, the fact that the developers made so much content that is easily missable, the interactions with npcs and pawns and random world events are all things that makes this game better than great. As for the endings (spoiler not major) which there are three of to my knowledge, I found the base ones to be good but somehow leaving a empty feeling behind as if there was more to be desired. However when i came across the secret ending and area I was simply left in awe from the initiation of the secret ending and the opening of a new area to the actual ending of it, this is the real reason for my simply put ""love"" for this game. I have no words to express how amazing i felt after experiencing this ending. It gave me closure in a game's story more than any other ending to a game I have ever played and that is why it will always remain in my heart as one of if not the greatest starts and finishes of a game ever and i accredit it all to the secret ending. An overall amazing gaming experience that I would warmly recommend to anyone who is a fan of fantasy stories and open world games with a lot of depth.Short version: Great game,super awesome, secret ending is a must :)",1
Positive,Dragons Dogma 2 is incredibly fun when you ain't got a twitter bitch in your ear telling you its terrible,1
Positive,"while the game's critical path is rather short and the story's pacing is very fast, the combat and encounters in this game are possibly top of the market right now in terms of action RPG titles. performance issues are a little tannoying but i've only ever had problems in big cities. there is plenty to explore and enough playstyles for everyone to find something they like to play.",1
Positive,"Dragon's Dogma 2, while it has its positives it also sadly has its negatives. With really questionable performance at launch, and also having micro-transactions that are next to worthless, sadly they are still there and I 100% think that they shouldn't have been there in the first place for a full price triple A game (70$ USD) do not buy this game at full price. However, I can say without a doubt that I am glad I got to play Dragon's Dogma 2, It was an amazing experience, but all in all not worth the price tag.",1
Positive,"Combat is the main selling point and thankfully it's great. The story is ok, not the best, but at least it's not the vague type of storytelling where you have to read the flavor text of every item. If you liked the first game, you'll definitely like this one. Just don't bother with the dlc items because they all can be earned in game.",1
Positive,"This game is amazing. Despite being a single player game with unnecessary microtransactions (all items can be acquired by just playing the main campaign), the game excels in it's gameplay, being unique in a lot of aspects from combat to A.I mechanics. Movement here feels realistic (as many other stuff do), where all weight you are carrying matters and affects how your arisen can move between enemies. Classes are simple to use, with lots of cool moves and skills, from magically grabbing an enemy and tossing him into another, to wreaking havoc summoning a tornado on your enemies faces. The campaign main story is quite simple, being shallow with quests that doesnt quite fit into the game core mechanics (i.e entering certain places without been seen), but they do get better eventually. World map is big, with lots of P.O.I and hidden stuff to find and all. Could be more colorfull, but that's me, map looks great. Unfortunately, the game has some performance issues, but the devs adressed already to that, patching on future updates.8/10 cuz microtransactions sucks ass,9/10 without it",1
Positive,"Primeiro de tudo: sim, existem microtransa es predat rias, por m tudo que vendido na loja pode ser adquirido dentro do jogo e digo que at sem muito esfor o.

Positive,"i dont get all the fuss? when i get to a boss that kills me once i can just buy some rift crystals and rent out a high level pawn to help me kill the enemies? i think this is a pretty big win in my eyes, some people such as myself have very time consuming things to do in life, such as renting out my various properties, i recent increased the rent of one of my locations so that i could buy myself some port crystals and rift crystals, i had some pushback from the rentoids but i told them the increase would help me remove the black mould in their childs bedrom in a timely manner, which ill do when i finish dragons dogma 2 (4-7 months)",1
Positive,"Redoing my review since I beaten the game twice and done what I feel like, EVERYTHING on the map. I am someone who played the living hell out of the first game, watched and liked the anime. Know I only have 44 hours at the moment which really isn't enough time to fully explore the game so I missed a pretty good size of some things so don't take this review as if it was the written to be 100% fact. This will try to be a non-bias and realistic review as possible. I do understand this game is not trying to hold your hand too, which is fine again I'm a VET to this series. Will contain spoiler, will not hide it.If you liked the first game you'll like this one. Its very familiar, which is good and also bad.PROS:-COMBAT; is a bit more smoothed out compared to the first game. Best way to compare it is Xenoverse 1 gameplay to Xenoverse 2, it just FEELS better in terms of that but there really not any real changes. Compared to the first game I don't even grapple onto the enemies which was my favorite feature. I never had the need to grapple enemies since level 1. -MAP; is way bigger, which is great (but as every other open world there some draw backs)-CLASSES; Are pretty cool feel great, old classes had some tweaks for the better. Trickster is really good but very lazy/boring gameplay. You really only 3 skills the rest are kinda pointless. Would've been nice if the class had toxic, burning, frost skills for its fumes.-CUTSCENES/CHARACTER CREATION; D*mn great. I wish there were more cutscenes CONS:-This game is not very welcoming to New Players, funny thing is Dark Souls is more welcoming because it a bit more straight forward. Call it a skill issue to the new players or them not being able to read the tutorial. But as a VET I played the game knowing what to do. But I also watched someone who new to the series play it and I see them struggle to understand it. You can argue that there is a tutorial section where they can read it for more information, alright fair. But I still think my point still stands that a lot of new players lose interest fast.-Which leads to my second con; the beginning of the game is a DRAG. The story mode follows the same formula as the first, again which is fine because Soul series (easiest thing to compare it to terms of story) is straight forward copy and paste, go kill bosses proceed to new area, repeat till you reach end game. Same thing with this game, you go to the first town, soldiers escort you to the main city, do a few quests to get your motor running, kill dragon, world goes to hell, fix it, NG. -Which (again) leads to my third con; Story is short. This isn't necessarily isn't a bad thing if you balanced it out with side stories (Mind you I haven't done all side quests as of writing this). Their seems to be a lack of good storied side content in this game as in their too short. The Hugo story also seems to be bugged, I can't tell I gave the jail keeper his gold to release him but I guess I had to talk to this one specific guard to continue it? I have no idea.-Vague quests/objectives; This is a double edge sword, while it also makes me feel good I solved some of these by myself after like a hour of banging my head. This is what will turn people off from the story and side quests that appears in the beginning of the game. Why are some of these objectives so weird to approach. Talking to the False Sovran, it is by chance I found how to proceed, because all I did was read ""he wasn't in the night party"" online which was enough of me to go and mindlessly find a pretty damn good secret on how he left the party. A little too good of a secret if you ask me. Following the storyteller hobo, why couldn't I ask people around where he was after midday, also why make it to where I had to wait for so long to watch him move to a different place? I wish the bench can let me access specific time like Skyrim Rest time. Those 2 are just the easiest one to explain, there's others. But for the sake of making this short as possible. One more thing, why the hell there was no news of a dragon attacking Melve to unlock the hybrid Spear class? Maybe I just missed people talking about it or I should've just gone back up there (which there really is no need to go back up to that area but for 1 quest MAYBE), this is where I feel like this should be the most talked about thing in the capital city or maybe that shouldve been in the story quest the captain leads you on about. I don't know call it a skill issue for me I guess.-Monsters; Wow oh wow its mostly just lizards, goblins, and harpies. Night time, ghosts, undead, harpies. Its so crazy this game has a variety of monsters but I fight the same thing for 95% of the game. You would think traveling to a new region will let me experience new monsters. Nope just the same thing mostly. -Elite Enemies; Ogre, Griff's, Chimera, etc. Why weren't these monsters in the main story? You did it in the first game. First boss, HYDRA (sweet). Then Chimera, then dragon, then Lich. This game story boss a giant statue, which wasn't bad but thats like the first BOSS BOSS in the game and thats right before the Dragon. Thats utterly insane, which makes the story weak. Lich I didn't see till end game, Chimera I only encountered once in beginning (again I haven't really explored this game entirely.) You have all these elite type of enemies but you never really used them for side quests, they're just encounters unlike the first game you used them for the story. So why not in this game.? Two armored ogre fight? Gone. Lich? Doesn't really play that much of a story. Drakes eh they come and go. Golemn? Play the same could maybe make a different type. -Open world: Open world is okay, but it falls off when you have a bunch of pointless caves. This is where you could've added a lot of dungeons like Elden Ring (even though they felt all the same but YOU have many varieties of enemies/bosses.) This is where the side content of quests could've kicked in like saving the Elf princess from the Minotaur. That was kinda cool. First game, this one dungeon you used twice had 2 different bosses (I think, vaguely remember). Which leds to this, because of lack of said dungeons the elite enemies feel. weak? That tight CQC isn't there because all the fights happen above ground which has PLENTY OF SPACE TO RUN AMONK. The Elite enemy don't feel as aggressive compare to the first and because of the open space and no CQC it makes it feel like I'm whacking these elites super easily. The first game had that ""Alright Party, we are going to venture into a dungeon."" Especially in Dark Arisen. Sometimes you encountered a Hellish version of some of the elites because of these dungeons unlike normal Griffin or normie Chimera. I like this game, and playing a second playthrough to fully experience the missing content. Again maybe I missed a lot of cool stuff, but so did many other players that are vets as well. There a difference between no hand holding vs not telling us because we gotta be in a specific place at a specific time at a specific part of the game story progression. Its a bit much because I do wanna experience this game. I say this as a VETwho wants NEW PLAYERS to join the community. But atm its not welcoming. You guys added microtransaction day 1. Which you can entirely ignore because there is LITERALLY no reason to buy any of that stuff. You get all that in game for free, EASILY. So why make the game no hand holding, but also add this type of micro? Makes me confuse on what your telling the community. RC is easy to obtain but making it to where you can purchase it? It leaves a bad taste. What do you with RC? Just buy character edit and personality books with some glasses to buy. So again, why put up the micro if you want players to experience this game in a certain way, it a contradiction.",1
Positive,"Most fun I have had since BG3Challenging yet rewarding, this game does not hold your hand at allstuttering and popins are noticeable but it mostly sticks to cities so combat is still fun and playable",1
Positive,Amazing Game that allows you to get lost in the world,1
Positive,Games a masterpiece. Anyone blinded of it quality by the micro transactions seem to have missed the thought that they can just not buy them. This game is exactly as the first one was. fast travel is not supposed to be easy to do and remaking your character is doable after beating the game (also like the first one.) so anyone complaining now just never played the first one and are running with the hate train. This game is a masterpiece and the fights with mythical creatures are more epic than in the first one. So yes buy the game and no you don't need to buy anything to get a sense of fulfillment out of the game,1
Positive,"Fantastic game. My only complaint would be is that there seems to be a slightly smaller variety of monsters compared to the first game. Other than that, Dragons Dogma 2 just feels like a upgrade over the first. You'll like this if you liked the first.I'd give it a 8.5/10",1
Positive,"Before you buy:The game overall I'd say is a 7/10. Most of the complaints seem to be the fact that a single player game has micro-transaction. I get it but at the same time you don't need to buy them at all. I've beaten the game without buying a single thing with real life money, didn't even feel the need to. The game offers plenty of things to buy everything in game so I personally don't know what the complaint is. There is no point where I've felt the need to buy anything off the store page at all. Need RC? No problem. Your pawn makes them as people hire them, along with you killing small or large monsters along the way. Sure, why does a single player game has micro transaction at all? Idfk lol but games like this in particular you don't need to buy it, unless you're lazy, short on time or whatever. Just enjoy the sight and grind, the whole point of an rpg. The save system and not having multiple characters I can kind of understand. At the same time you spend most of the game staring at the back of your character's head, along with if you're wearing a helm or not. Even in the cutscenes you don't get to see your character's face too much. Your character doesn't have any lines outside of grunts like Link in Zelda. The story I feel like is lacking, I don't know how to explain. It could've been better. If they spent half the time working on character creator I think they could've done a lot better with the story. Most of the missions are just find out who did this, who's behind the curtain pulling the strings and then defeat them. Very C tier story and mellow plot. The game is also pretty easy and not very challenging. Especially with the mystic spearhand vocation, just spam a shield and go ham. The character creation is S tier, I saw Adam Sandler, Jason Mamoa and Daenerys walking about in the world. The character creation is top notch, I bet people spend more time creating their character and main pawn than actually playing the game. Performance wise, I personally don't have much to complain about. I've seen people comment about how they have a top tier pc yet no matter what they do, the performance is garbage. Not sure if it's user error or I'm just lucky. I have a 4070 Super, Ryzen 7 7700X and 32 gb of ram. Maxed out settings, no DLSS or any resolution upscale settings, along with ray tracing turned on. I've not crashed once. The frame gets low in the 2 big cities but not to the point where it gets ""unplayable."" I get max/smooth 55 fps with lows of 45 fps running around Vernworth (even when fighting monsters inside), 50 and 40 when it rains. Outside of those cities, even while raining, lots of enemies while in combat, I run a smooth 87-79 fps. I don't get how people with 4090s complain about the game crashing even with lowering settings, maybe CPU bottlenecking? I've read that in cities most of the strain comes from the CPU or something idk, do some research, watch some gameplays I suggest.TL:DR Go watch some youtube videos, games good but not great.Personal opinion below: Replayability: 8Performance: 8 Gameplay/combat: 8Difficulty: 5Story: 7Character Creation: 10Graphics: 9",1
Positive,outside of the performance issues and the useless microtransactions(yes they are bad practice) This game is 100000/10 for me. My GOTY tbh. I'll play this shit out til Im done with every vocation and doing the endgame on each one as well,1
Positive,"Performance aside, for every huge leap forward the sequel takes in comparison to the original, it takes like 2-3 steps back. Someone should have told Itsuno that ""maybe a mechanic that will kill every NPC in a hub and potentially ruin a playthrough and no new game option is a bad idea.""6/10 Dark Arisen was better.",1
Positive,"The game is fantastic but the dlc mtx is all a noob trap. All of the purchasable items are items you can obtain in game at base. (aside from the camping kit which weights slightly less than others)If you really want to play the game, buy only the game. Otherwise, you are literally wasting your money.",1
Positive,"Most definitely recommend this game if you enjoy exploring, great combat and hearing the callout ""there's a ladder over there"" frequently. Enjoying everything the game has to offer, while the amount of microtransactions is questionable it does not take anything away from the experience. However the performance is questionable, a lot spikes and towns just really poor for FPS, disappointed in Capcom as their previous games have been amazing for performance. Edit: now 30 hours deep and more to go! There's still so much to explore and do, my only complaint is the lack of enemy types.",1
Positive,"Amazing game. As much as I love a good mob this game doesn't deserve the review bombing. All items are easily acquired in game. Deluxe edition gear is obsolete after first hour, just a way to support the devs. My PC is no beast and runs it just fine. Never seen such undeserved hate on a release and I'm super critical of games at launch, especially those with so called ""micro-transactions"".",1
Positive,"TLDR: If you want to play a unique RPG and dont mind the entry price of less than a bethesda title, go for it.Anyone who thinks the micro-transactions are predatory is coping from Battlefront 2 lootboxes and their Minecraft Jail RP Server (With Booster Packs). They didn't get 1 hour into the game before wanting to open their wallet to skip both the RP and G of this Roleplaying Game by hiring over-leveled pawns to carry them. Fun game i will continue to play this as much and as long as i did the 1st only this time not on 3 different systems over the years (I'm biased as hell)Edit: Spelling, so i didn't look stupid",1
Positive,"As you can see I've spent almost 50 hrs playing this game. I've reached almost lvl 50 simply by playing quests and simply exploring. Not once did I have to grind for anything besides like hunting certain monsters for their life and material drops. The story was great and has some moments that reference DD1 so for us Veterans of DD1 we'll be sure to notice it. Either way I had a ton of fun and would very much recommend it as i've not had any performance issues or crashes as i'm using a $500 dollar PC and I set my settings on high and going over my graphics limit. And I couldn't care less about MTX because its literally Capcom's things and you can all look back at their previous games to see it and that affect nothing besides for those who want to streamline their gameplay that doesn't break a single thing or give you a headstart.Just have fun exploring this new world and an entertaining story that will draw you in! Show the world how strong your will is, Arisen!",1
Positive,"Instead of writing down 1000 words, vote with your wallet. 1. Never preorder games. 2. Don t spend on microtransactions. Refund if you are furious about microtransactions.Microtransactions in a single player game with a full AAA box price hurt the structure of the gameplay, the game s reception and the players. Note: you do not need to buy anything except for the base game to have fun!As for the game. It gives you that one SPIRIT OF ADVENTURE we play games for! It s like in a Witcher or Hogwarts, but your way is kinda more limited by obstacles. I have to go south for the quest, but I decide to go north: I fight goblins and wolves, find a dungeon, meet a cyclops and do a side quest. This is why we play RPGs. Locations are handcrafted, I took a lot of screenshots already because the game is beautiful for my taste (there is a photo mode). Performance is playable, fps drops in cities but if I wait a few seconds for the game to render it - it s playable again.Your weapon choice gives you a different feeling of combat every time, if you think you struggle with big enemies I highly suggest you try another class. Game is quirky, fun and awesome and I want to play it every minute of my spare time. I wish the executives' greed wasn t a thing so we could appreciate the work of artists and share our adventures in reviews. But here we are.",1
Positive,"The performance of this game can be a pain but if you manage to get a good enough PC, this game is overly addictive.I'm spending my time exploring and keep wanting more.It's one of the first game where I don't get annoyed every time I get in a fight. I'm even waiting for it.I'm still in Vernworth after 50 hours because I'm exploring so much.The ""no fast travel"" is not so annoying even if it takes time because the travel is filled with combats. And the one where you're like ""Ugh it's on the other side of the map"" there is usually an Ox Cart (paid with gold) or a Portcrystal (paid with a Ferrystone which can be bought in game on vendors).The pawn system is really great and the dialogues makes me chuckle from time to time.",1
Positive,"Game is a big step up from the first.Few issues with it though.Only one save. I understand the reasoning for it. To stop save scumming but come on, I lost a bunch of progress due to me loading from last inn, which took me back to the beginning of the game. Luckily I was able to get back to where I was previously quick. I've heard people losing 10's of hours because of this, be careful. I use the inn often now.Performance is pretty bad. Runs decent on my system. Mainly 70-80fps but in Vernworth and towns its horrible. Capcom has address the issue of CPU load. Hopefully a patch coming in soon.If you can get around those couple hiccups and liked the first one, I'd definitely say its worth it.",1
Positive,"DD2 is a great improvement on DD1! You don't need to play DD1 as this game is more of a refresh! :D I think by now we've all heard the negatives about this game. A lot of it is just people wanting a reason to complain. The money transaction items are all items you can find within 2 hours of play time. Honestly even sooner since I'm a person that likes to explore every nook and cranny. I've found so many Wakestone shards, camping gear, and gotten plenty of Riftstone currency just exploring. There are performance issues due to the massive resources required to support all the NPCs in game. And there are A LOT. No complaints though because it just feels natural having all these Pawns, townsfolk, and monsters walking around. Hopefully there's a patch soon. My current workaround is to lower the graphic settings.In short: buy the game, ignore the negative comments about it.",1
Positive,"Dragon's Dogma 2 has been the most fun I've had playing a game in a long time. It exceeds the first game in every element and I couldn't be happier. There's just not enough time in the day to get lost in this amazing fantasy world.I have had so many moments where I gasp in amazement because of a non-scripted action me or my pawns do together. The physics are so unbelievably amazing too. I've had battles where a giant cyclops falls against a hill with its body accurately leaning on it. The pawn system is greatly improved too, and it's a joy having other people's pawns lead you on short adventures for treasure they've previously found before with their player. I feel like there's just so much that I love that it's hard to put into words in this review. Just know that I absolutely love this game with all my heart.The performance could be better, but it hasn't ruined my experience. I do understand some people have crashes so I hope there's a fix to address that in the future, but I haven't had any issues yet. The DLC situation is incredibly overblown though, and they do not impact your play-through at all. None of the items are exclusive and the impact they have is very little and is meant only to give you a slight head-start in the beginning, and they are not taken ""out of the game"" to make you pressured to buy them either. There is fast travel between major towns from the ox-carts, and there are in-game items that called Ferrystones and Portcrystals that let you fast travel. The Portcrystal DLC is only one additional portcrystal (there's 10 in-game to find) and you have to travel to the place you want to put it, then you have to use a Ferrystone (not available as DLC, but somewhat uncommon to find in-game) to even fast travel to it. It's a punishing system because the game expects you to take adventuring/traveling as a challenge in itself. It really hurts me that this game already has such a bad reputation for something so mundane.",1
Positive,It's Dragons Dogma 1.5 in all the best ways.,1
Positive,"Probably my favorite game I've played in 2024, I can't wait to keep playing. Mystic Spearhand for life. Also, ignore what people are saying about micro transactions, they don't matter, don't buy them.",1
Positive,Performance issues aside this is a great game and one of the most unfairly maligned launches that I can remember.,1
Positive,A fantastic open world game set in a fantasy world where behind every corner a new adventure awaits. Gameplay and the Pawn system are so fun that I want to go an the next adventure right now!,1
Positive,Everything is good when your computer is powerful.,1
Positive,I loved Dragons dogma 1 and it's DLC Dark Arisen and i love Dragons dogma 2. No game captures the feeling of going on an adventure quite like these games.,1
Positive,Haters wanna hateLovers wanna loveI don't even wantNone of the aboveWhat you would expect from a sequel 12 years later.poorly optomized so you may not be able to even play it.,1
Positive,"***THIS IS STRICTLY TALKING ABOUT THE GAME AND NOT THE TECHNICAL ISSUES AND SCUMMY COMPANY DECISIONS, THOSE HAVE ALREADY BEEN COVERED***After finishing the game, I can give a more fair review.I definitely like it a bit more than the original, and I was a huge fan of it when it came out back in 2012 and played the shit out of it on the 360 when I was younger. I loved the game, flaws and all. The vast majority of the original game's aspects are still here and greatly improved upon. For the most part, anyway. There were a few minor gripes that I had.The Good: The world is truly massive, and is teeming with nooks and crannies begging to be explored. If you like wide open adventure, this one's for you. Combat is a major step up from the first game, and the elements that the original combat fun and exciting are all still here, and expanded upon. Pawn AI is much better for the most part, with a few hiccups here and there. As for the pawns themselves, the different personalities is a welcome change compared to the first. The specializations are also a great addition. In addition, they can do a few more extra helpful things than they did in the original. Visuals and graphical effects are quite nice. which I'm sure a lot more people will be able to appreciate them when they finally fix the damn performance. The new vocations are pretty dope and just neat all around. Addition of new races other than human and the expanded lore is pretty neat. Fast travel other than the ferry stones, albeit minimal, is still very much a welcome change.The Less-Good: Still no lip-syncing animations for dialogue. Only in cutscenes. Not the worst thing in the world, that's how the first game was, but I would've hoped for that change. The story. The story certainly isn't bad by any means, it's actually got a really solid setup. The execution of it in a few areas, however, is pretty weak. And I won't spoil anything about the ending, but all I can say is that there were quite a few loose ends and unresolved plot points and conflicts that would have been nice to see resolutions for. The story, while not bad, really wasn't the strongsuit of the game The length. I suppose this also kinda ties into the story point, but the length of it for the caliber and scale that the game was going for, felt a bit short. Keep in mind, that's in relative terms. My first playthrough was still 32 hours. And that was with me not strictly focusing on the main story. But with the scope that the game felt like it was going for, I would've expected a first playthrough time of around 50-60 hours, if not more. By the ending kinda left me with a "".that was it?"" sort of feeling. Felt rushed towards the end and cut short in relativity to the rest of the game. The romance system is still not too fantastic, and is even a little weaker in some areas than the first game, which already wasn't the strongest. It still has the same impact on the story, but overall there are far less major options, and not as much meaningful interaction between the Arisen and their chosen companion. Not to say there isn't any, there is still meaningful story interaction with the options available, just not as much as the original. The change of vocations from the original. Now, this was a positive point prior, but the part that I didn't like was the axing of one or two of the old hybrid classes. The Assassin from the first game, the fighter rogue combination, was completely removed. The Arcane Archer is still there, and the Mystic Knight has been replaced with the Mystic Spearhand. Not to say the Mystic Spearhand is bad or anything, I would have just preferred an option more akin to the original Mystic Knight, and just have the spearhand be an addition on top of that. But the assassin in particular just got completely axed, which kinda sucks cuz a lot of people, myself included, really liked that vocation. The Warfarer is the closest thing you can get, but it really isn't the same. It's more of a jack of all trades kind of vocation, so you can mix a bit of the fighter rogue stuff like the first game, but it really doesn't have any unique things going for it. Not to mention it takes away one of your abilities for the ability to switch weapons. Not gonna lie, that was kinda lame. It works, but I definitely would have preferred more options as opposed to adding new options(the new unique classes) and taking old ones away. New Game+ really isn't much of a thing. It's there, but it doesn't increase the difficulty or level scaling for your second playthrough. There's also no Hard Mode. This may change in the future, but as of writing this, that's how it currently is. And obviously, the performance and the greedy, scummy and utterly baffling decisions made by Capcom. The optimization is a temporary thing, sure, but the predatory design and the microtransactions are beyond despicable and greedy. Not going into further detail about this, everyone else has already covered it dozens of times.Final Thoughts:The game itself is still really good and absolutely worth playing. It's an improvement in most areas to the first. If you liked the first, you'll like this one. My review is still going to stay negative for the moment until they fix the optimization and add the option to start your game over rather than having to pay or find a fucking item many hours into the game just to fix something on the character creator.TL;DRGreat game, held down by bad optimization(for the moment) and utterly greedy and terrible corporate decisionsIn the nicest way I can possibly put this,Go fuck yourselves, Capcom.EDIT: Most of the issues have been addressed. I would only get it if you liked the first game.",1
Positive,"Since everyone seem to complain and make this such a big deal i decided to give my own review about this game.SO CALLED ""ISSUES"":Yes there is ""microtransactions"" but you can get all these items in the first few hours so my guess is that its there for those who just want to skip the grind, also there is some fps drop in towns (to 30fps) but i have mostly been around 60 fps with rtx3060 and medium/high settings rest of the game so people are either overreacting or too lazy to change graphics settings.GAMEPLAY:For me, gameplay has been smooth and really great i guess my biggest complain would be that sometimes the game holds your hand a little too much for example i was told to get gold ores so it showed the exact location in the map but in some other quests it dosent tell you anything it dosent even show some quests in quest menu so they are easy to miss. also the lack of romance and spiciness in ""romance"" scenes is disappointing for 20k worth of gold (never going back to that brothel again)STORY (no spoilers):The story is good its better than i expected but i feel like it could be a little longer.OVERALL:I think this is my game of the year for sure even tho somethings could have been done better so i do recommend buying this game if you like open world RPGs PS:This game reminds me a lot of Isekai type of anime so thats probably why i like it so much",1
Positive,"I do not have a top of the line PC nor the best graphics card and I've not had a single issue yet, hopefully I won't but I know they are working on fixing some of the issues others are having. I turned down quite a few of the settings to help with the load, as well as keeping settings to balanced/performance, and the game is still beautiful. I am enjoying playing so far, though it's early days. Combat is tricky and I am still getting the hang of it but that's just because I am a mediocre gamer at best lol. I will say for those with disabilities, some of the setup with combat might prove a bit challenging. I have a difficult time holding down the ctrl key to switch weapon skills so keep that in mind. I love the interactions with pawns and exploration is just as satisfying as the first game. I look forward to many more hours in DD2 and I am in no hurry to finish it!",1
Positive,"ignore the fucking morons bitching and crying and spreading misinformation about the useless dlc, the game is fucking fantastic even with low framerate and will only get better when its fixed",1
Positive,"If it wasn't for the performance (no major issues on my part) and the only one save no new game thing (very very strange), this would be my contender for game of the year. As it stands, it's just my favourite game since Elden Ring.",1
Positive,"The game itself in insanely good, I have a Ryzen 5 3600 and a 2070 Super with 16gb of RAM and the game runs at 60+ fps in the open world, dropping at 20s but stabilising at 30+/- in the first big city - performance wise it's playable, and hopefully with the performance patch dropping soon (copium) the game can only get better.The MTX are all items you can get in-game, Capcom does the same in most releases and nobody loses their minds over that. Also only 1 save and no new game, who thought that was a good idea?Is the game fun and addicting? I have logged 22 hours in about 2 days. It's a great game that is being hindered by subpar performance, once that is taken care of, the game is easily a must have for fans of the genre. It really made me appreciate Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen even more than I already did, and I played that game with subpar performance too at 30 FPS.",1
Positive,"TLDR: Corporate bad, game fun, runs ok.Despite Capcom's blatant attempts to destroy this game upon launch, its thoroughly enjoyable. For the complaints about the microtransactions: Yes it is the dumbest thing in the world for a $70 single player game to release with microtransactions.However, you can obtain everything they are attempting to sell incredibly easily in game through a myriad of means. Performance issues are there, especially in dense population areas, but that is really the only place iv noticed a significant impact on performance. I wish capcom would realize that shoving these insane microtransactions down people's throats is only hurting them in the long run, it shows they have no confidence in their game to stand on its own. Corporate bullshit aside, i think after the game gets some performance fixes, itll be a solid 8/10.",1
Positive,"game good, people bad. or just really stupid?Okay yeah the game runs like shit, and yes micro-transactions are scummy.However,All the items you can buy with real money, are EASILY OBTAINABLE in the game. In 2 hours of playtime I have already purchased 2 character re-edits with IN-GAME CURRENCY. Wakestones? I got them from breathing in the wild. RC? Same as before. got it from breathing (IN-GAME OF COURSE)and really. P2W? In a single player game? I'd say it's more like Pay 2 Lose because ur just wasting money on easily obtainable items. Game itself is fantastic and I am excited to explore this beautiful fantasy world. I do hope for an optimisation patch soon though.",1
Positive,"The Game:10/10 Never have I played an open-world fantasy action RPG where I found myself so immersed, so thoroughly surprised by emergent unscripted gameplay, so completely enthralled and engrossed in the depth of combat, as I have with Dragon s Dogma 2. Imagine Elden-Ring levels of map verticality, but in a more traditional and less obscure or abstract setting, like say a LOTR/ GOT high-fantasy world. Combine that with Dark Souls, nay Monster Hunter levels of combat crispness and sheer variety. All while experiencing in-combat freedom and innovation akin to Balder s Gate III. This game, Ladies and Gentlemen, is on another level. It s better than Elden Ring. There, I ve said it. Fight me.The Bad:Technically, performance-wise, YES, it IS a small unmitigated disaster on PC, and even on consoles, from what I hear. There is a small mod fix enabling Frame-Generation for people with 40-series GPU s, so check into that if it applies to you, but yeah. Currently, It sucks. Let s wait and see how quickly they manage to fix this.The Controversy:The people who are taking all this self-righteous video-game-justice-warrior nonsense as seriously as they are, and it's NOT their job!? .They need to grow up and get a life! And for the content-creators out there: Just stop it already! You're just blowing it so out-of-proportion for them clicks! The fact it s devolved into some out-spoken ber-nerd fuck-wits, attacking fellow content-creators like my boy @FightinCowboy is just outrageous. First of all, Who in the retarded fuck spends money on microtransactions that essentially help you to skip the entire game-experience!?!? If there are people out there who do. Seriously!? Fuck 'em! Let them buy it. It's predatory, I get it. but at this point, this whole conversation is just for content-creators to create clout and clicks around some contrived controversy and it s sad, because it s taking away from a game that, I believe, performance issues aside, should and will be talked about as utterly genre-defining for years to come.",1
Positive,"As of this review, I have played this game on two different computers for about 8 hours, starting the moment it unlocked and installed on launch day. Overall this is one of the best games I've played in the last 12mo. It really hits on all cylinders and I haven't had any significant perf issues.Gameplay: this game is everything I wanted. It has elements of Monster Hunter, Breath of the Wild, Skyrim, and somehow also feels a bit like playing Spiderman in terms of the feeling of freedom and movement. The combat is chaotic and fun and your Pawns are surprisingly intelligent and interesting. The need to constantly switch out your party and update your tactics feels a bit like the need to be flexible and able to adapt to any weapon in Breath of the Wild. The need to pay attention to the time of day, plan ahead, and the general threat of the open world is refreshing. It makes travel meaningful. There are a lot of design decisions in this game that I should dislike but somehow they come together in a package that feels fair and logical, even when I get my butt kicked by some powerful creature out of nowhere.Graphics: The graphics are mindblowing on both of my computers. That's really all there is to say.Audio: Sound is fine. Effects are great, music is just kinda ""there"". This isn't a Divinity, Ori, or Skyrim class soundtrack.Performance: This game seems to eat a lot of resources but I haven't had any of the performance problems others have cited. See my computer stats below.Computer 1: custom-built gaming desktop with 64gb ram, a liquid cooled 32 core Ryzen processor, and an RTX 3070. I played at 4k with moderately high settings and no ray tracing. The game ran consistently at 50-60fps with a few drops into the 20s once in a great while.Computer 2: Lenovo Legion Slim 5 laptop with 32gb ram, Ryzen 7840HS, Radon 780M. I played at 2560x1600 at 120hz and capped at 120fps. I'm not sure what FPS I'm getting. It's definitely not 120fps, probably also 50-60 and rare frame drops. I have not measured FPS because it has felt smooth the vast majority of the time.I have experienced none of the city perf issues others have mentioned. I have been to the first major city you visit during the main quest and been in battles where a large number of monsters and pawns happened to cross paths. The worst thing I can say about this game is the dialog is a bit odd and the story progression can feel disjointed. Occasionally physics and animations can look a little wonky, especially when falling off a short drop. But none of that interferes with the incredible experience this game has to offer.",1
Positive,Its like Dragon's Dogma 1 But bigger and better looking.There is lots to explore and tons of intresting things to find allong the way.im playing the game in 4k on High with a RTX 3080 TI with raytracingAnd the gameplay is smooth and the performance is great. ( But the game does lag when quickly swapping from the map to the inventory back into the game )The DLC is optional and not needed to enjoy the game ( as everything can be easily obtained in game )in my hrs playing i already found multiple portcrystals and multiple ferrystones.,1
Positive,Game is great you take your time its not made for rushing the story Steam Community are trolls yes ! I agree on certain points . micro-transaction is very annoying for some people . was capcom Greedy yes ! Sure they are but micro-transaction is an (Optional choices) everything inside the micro Transaction on steam Store are Early Game stuff . so for people who Over React over stupid stuff like this when its a personal Decision if player base wants to pay it or not that by far is what made me very angry optimisation issue ? Yes there is its Normal not a single game ive bought on steam had a great lunch . open world is fun the pawn system is great . weapons has good mechanics . the save file thing does need to change but then again its also in game to change your character . Dragon Dogma 1 was also the same way so for all those people complaining about weird stuff on steam i dont think they ever experience any of the dragon dogma games . enjoy the game explore and if the people who buy micro-transaction let them be at the end of the day its just a personal choice. 94 $ game sure ? No one forcing players to buy it either .,1
Positive,"Does this game have problems? Undoubtedly. The two most glaring ones at the moment:Performance issues on PC even on high-end machines are painfully obvious in big, populated cities.No way to start a new game at the moment.Is the game good? It is incredible. If you are starved for a great RPG where you can get lost in the game's world which you are free to explore as you wish, if you were waiting for an RPG like Elder Scrolls, where you can come up with your own solutions for different challenges game throws at you, give it a go.This game will reignite your sense of wonder, letting you explore to your heart's content.Combat is flashy and lots of fun, interactions with pawns, both when in a fight and exploring have this amazing sense of camaraderie as if you're on a great quest with your buddies in an MMORPG but the dynamic world and interactions both with it as well as your pawns allow for a lot of interesting solutions and funny and epic outcomes.All microstransactions are completely optional and items/services that they are promoting can be acquired in-game, without spending anything extra.As long as you can run it, give it a go.It is an incredible RPG adventure with a couple of glaring issues somewhat souring the experience.",1
Positive,"This game is phenomenal.Its not new knowledge that people like to complain when things go wrong, but not advocate as hard for the opposite when they love it. I want to be a voice for the side that thinks this game is amazing and wants to talk about that fact. Yes there are some FPS issues in cities, its not the worst ever (they are also already adressing it. It comes from a bug that pulls from CPU power when it shouldn't when there are a lot of NPCs), but the only things I need to do there are buy/sell/upgrade or store items and then i leave to the whole map in which I get 70-100 FPS in on my laptop.Yes, there are microtransactions. BUT, you do not need to buy a single one, every single thing apart from the camping dlc which is just a reskin for the campsite, can be earned in game from just playing the game as it is. It pains me that some people can be so thick to the point they don't give any benefit of the doubt, or pounce on their own negative opinions, because I've seen games where the premium content (which are just regular in game items anyway not special) that can be earned in game costs 100x the normal price of things. At least in DD2 its very reasonable. I've already gotten a bunch of the items from playing without paying for the dlc.Now for some game talk, This game has an amazing feel, between the physics and the combat and locking is just so satisfying. I am enjoying the thief class immensely, I love the execution moves and how good it is for bringing down large monsters. The random events and way that quests can pop up constantly keep me interested and surprised as I rarely expect some of the things that happen. They did a great job with the dynamic feel of the world. I'm still in the first city but I am already so excited to get more skills and explore the other classes, including the new ones. Its nice to be able to rearrange you're party whenever you want too in order to ensure you have the support you desire, such as ranged archer or support mage or offensive sorcerer.All in all I implore everyone to not pay heed to the extremely barebone reviews that only say ""I'm upset because I can buy this item at level 1 for $2 but I have to get to level 3 to buy it in game, thats too long now I HAVE to buy it with real money THANKS microtransactions."" Its a horrible way for an amazing piece of work to be treated when its really not quite true.Thanks for reading if you did,Please enjoy this game as much as I do.Kazma",1
Positive,"This game is awesome and a major nostalgia trip for me back to the first game. I'm not entirely sure why there are so many negative reviews, and it is interesting to see so many with so little game time. I don't have 100 hours logged yet, but I'll try to give my point of view with what I have seen so far. It is a huge game, with the ability to change vocations (classes) any time you wish to try new combat styles - including your main pawn. It is very easy to get distracted from the main quests and go off exploring or complete side quests. The performance has been great for me. The models and textures look great for such a huge game (especially the food when cooking!). There are micro-transactions, but in no way necessary. The micro-transactions are only for purchasing credits to buy pawns that are higher level that you. Any pawns at your level or lower, or your friends' pawns cost nothing. And you will passively accrue these pawn credits while playing. I don't feel the need to buy these, and I won't be. If you don't like it, then don't buy any micro-transactions.This is not a souls-like game. In my opinion, it is a nostalgic trip back to how adventure games used to be done pre-demon/dark souls.

Positive,"Dragon's Dogma 2 deserves a chance.To address the two main criticisms: Microtransactions - nothing is being sold that can't be attained in game. More importantly, the difficulty of obtaining them in game has not been increased just to push sales of microtransactions. They are for convenience only. Performance - there are performance issues inside [towns] and [settlements] for some users. Wherever there is a high concentration of NPCs, CPU usage can spike and lead to lower framerates and/or inconsistent frame times. My 7800X3D has not been observed below 60fps yet, but I am fortunate to be able to brute-force this very present issue.Now for some pros: Character creation - truly spectacular. I've seen Geralt, Gandalf, half the Baldur's Gate 3 cast and hundreds of unique creations in the short time I've played. It has a lot of heart. Use the independent creator to make your character ahead of playing, in case the performance issues are severe on your hardware so you don't eat into the 2 hour refund window. Exploration - what a world. I get lost in it, and it isn't forgiving. The sense of scale is unlike any other game I have played, and bests DD1. Combine this with a great atmosphere and game design that encourages you to get lost in this beautiful yet brutal world. Combat - meaty and fun. More options are available than in other games for this genre, beyond the skills / build you equip. Climbing enemies, tugging their legs to knock them off balance, picking up and throwing small enemies, bumping from high places, jumping from high places, the list goes on. And it's not easy, either. To summarise, this is the sequel we wanted it to be. Performance will improve in time, but if you are able to experience this game without technical issues there's a deep, exploration-driven RPG here that deserves a chance.Give it a try!",1
Positive,"Spent 3 hours getting the game to work past the opening cut scene, spent another 1hr trying to get the game not to crash in the first camp now the game crashes on start up. 4080, 32gb ram, R9 3900XT. I'm sure the game will eventually work, i'm just incredibly disappointed Ill adjust the review once im able to play it, im certain its alot of fun The MTX is all personal choice, if you played the first game, you know you don't need any of those items, as youll receive a plethora of them as you play. I can't refund it because of time played, so choose wisely where you want to drop $76.31EDIT: Ive changed my review, the game now functions without the use of 3rd party mods, I am having a good time playing, but I will not remove the top portion of this review. That was scumbag bullshittery and I can't directly blame the devs as I feel that team is very passionate, but the Executives and shareholders would be better suited keelhauled under a galleon.in a video game of course",1

Note to bomb reviewers:The only thing that can happen with review bombing is you hurt the dev team and they don;t deserve your shitty comments unrelated to the game, cause just one silly-greedy high level guy in capcom or whatever wanted his micro transactions. Leave out the the game and the dev team out from the rambling, as those are completely unrelated.",1
Positive,MTX doesn't really matter on a single player game if you can get the resources in game by just playing. If people pay because they don't have the time to grind the game then that's their choice and it wont impact your experience of the game.I've enjoyed the game so far,1
Positive,The game doesn't run that well on all specs. The game ai companions can be a bit weird sometime. The game does have the mechanic going for it after a few level. some of the design counter are great. like slime take close to 0 if not 0 slash damage. The exploration is really good. walking everywhere never felt better. I wish there will be more mobs density or the ability to increase mobs density. The questing is kinda standard and not a BG3. Idk why friendly npc have no loot drop. I mean that should be an option. overall i think is a great rpg when it work with your spec.,1
Positive,"Game is great. Exploring and combat are super fun and runs well on a 3080 except in big towns.Regarding microtransactions, first time with a Capcom game ? People need to check RE4 or DMC5",1
Positive,Game is pretty good getting a psychotic hate mob about MTX that are in literally every capcom game. Legitimate framerate problems especially in dense cities like the capital mostly fine in the open world though.,1
Positive,"Everything's been said by now, but I love this game and have had no issues whatsoever. Fantastic",1
Positive,"With a nod to some of the technical issues other reviews have mentioned. It's just a really fun game. It's got the adventuring-with-a-group-of-pals thing down. The pawns are definitely silly, weird lil guys with intentionally strange dialogue, but I love roaming the world with them. They are often extremely helpful, too; other player's pawns who have completed one of your quests before are happy to show you around and help you complete the quest too! They also don't require babysitting. They're fully capable of taking care of themselves 99% of the time, provided you're not trying to tackle a monster well beyond your party's abilities. There's a lot of complexity to the world and settlements, and finding secrets is very rewarding. There's hidden stuff everywhere, and I'm constantly getting sidetracked. In something like Skyrim that might bug me, but Dragon's Dogma is intentionally centered around this type of experience; think more of a Breath Of The Wild type thing where roaming is more important than quest hunting. (you'll still do some quest hunting though). It's also very combat focused, although most encounters are a lot shorter than in the first game, and don't slow your progress nearly as much. There's very few means of fast travel, and what is there usually requires time and preparation. I kinda like it, but also get a little frustrated by it. Your mileage may vary. The story is solid, but told through the very thematic, fantasy-british dialogue of the characters around you, and isn't always presented very well compared to other story focused games around right now. Don't expect Baldur's Gate 3 here. What you can expect is just enough good shit to get you exploring and fighting and making a name for yourself. I'm finding myself caught up in everything despite it being a little thin (at least in the early game). There's some neat political and power struggle storylines there, and I'm excited to see where they go.",1

As i have noticed, some people are crying about MTX that doesn't not matter in the slightest, i do understand the addition of these ""convenient"" items for purchase is a rather negative subject. but after looking at them, they are the most useless items that is also possible to acquire in-game with not much effort. Even the first game had gear that was included in the purchase of the game that gave you a boost . it's not an excuse for anything, but just bad practice. the MTX added with this release is for the really weak minded people with a credit card that has ZERO attention span or patience.For people that played the first.

Positive,"Despite the many negative comments on them offering a DLC option for impatient people, the actual game itself is really great and enjoyable as hell - and its only going to get better from here on out (patches, etc) - Looking forward to that but loving the game so far! One of the best character creation experiences ever! Also, getting to jump on a massive cyclops and stab it to death is just hilarious fun.No performance issues running the game with my 32core 7970x and 4080 Super at 2K. Finally someone made a video game that makes my threadripper sweaty and justify that $ CPU premium! :D",1
Positive,"First of all, congratulations to the devs for making this great game, you guys deserve it.Now then, let me give you my unbiased opinion regarding the controversies, I tried to make this opinion as objective as I could.1. Is Microtransaction really ruining the game?NO. I have played this game for around 7 hours and not a single time this game forced me to buy stuff with real money. The port crystals, wakestones, RC, are all obtainable in game and purely optional if you want to buy it for easier game experience.I agree that lack of port crystals early game makes the game tedious and a lot of backtracking, but that is game design decision. I remember feeling the same tediousness in Dragon's Dogma 1, but then once I get access to a lot of port crystals in mid-end game, it feels really good.True that they should never sell this item with real money in the first place, but if you don't want it to ruin the experience, then don't buy it. The game never forces you to buy anything from real money shop.2. Is the performance optimization really bad?YES, but only in town. The game runs relatively smooth when there's not much NPC around you (i.e. in open field, dungeon, etc), but when you get in town, it suddenly becomes choppy 30-40 fps-ish. I hope the devs can fix this issue as soon as possible because getting in town is really an integral part of the game experience.3. Is there really a lot of bugs that makes your character stuck?NOT ENOUGH INFO, during my 7 hours of gameplay, I have never encountered such bugs, but some person reported about it, so I can't give you real assurance. Your mileage may vary, this is a very early game release after all, bugs might occur.4. Is it true that you can only create 1 character?YES, and it's really a dumb decision. I guess it's a self explanatory, but creating multiple character with different build and playstyle is what makes the game replayability really fun. I hope the devs can add this feature as soon as possible and make it free. Don't make people pay to create another character, otherwise this game reputation would fall down even further.That's my opinion, here's the summary tl:dr:POSITIVE- Game is beautiful, fun combat, immersive world, and overall a good game.- Microtransaction exist, but is not forced and purely optional.NEGATIVE- Poor performance optimization in town.- Can't create multiple character.- Backtracking after quest is tedious.SUMMARYThis is a good game with flawed release.For now, I can only give it 6.5/10 due to performance issue and single character creation issue, but if the devs fixed it, I can give it 7.5/10.Update:After playing more, I feel like the experience is kinda mid. Not bad but not that good either, the game definitely needs more polish. For now, I think the game is overpriced and not worth $70 price.I'd say wait for >50% discount or wait for major performance/bugfix update before buying.",1
Positive,"I was a huge fan of Dragon's Dogma 1 i have waited for this game for over a decade,if capcom release performance patch, get rid of denuvo, and give us the ability to manage our save like any other rpg does, this game has the potential to be a masterpiece.The gameplay is good and dynamic, the world is vast and beautiful, the game doesnt hold your hand and actually let you explore ( you probably missed things on your first playthrough ), theres new game + for replayability.Other than the first 3 thing i mentioned, the game only lacks a randomized rogue-like type endgame dungeon, the same as Dark Arisen was in Dragon's Dogma 1, for us that wants to grind endlessly for the perfect gear and max lvl, theres hoping it comes in DLC in the future like in the first game.And theres hoping that we wont wait another decade for Dragon's Dogma 3 !",1

Positive,"Game rocks to no end. DD1 but better. The things that happen and how fights unfold just leave you laughing. Really good fun. Visually stunning, satisfying abilities. Great combat depth. Weighty combat. Warrior buffs oml. Inventory management is a downgrade. You cannot buy to or sell from your storage?Pawn System is an upgrade, they're simply better. Although you cannot alter their pawn speech rate anymore.MICROTRANSACTIONS:They're a starter pack, a terribly formatted over priced starter pack. Exact same as the first game. They're a one off purchase of items you can get more of within your first 3 hours of play. And there's no sight or sound of their existence once you're in game. They have no negative bearing on the game itself barring potentially the portcrystal one, though i have yet to feel hurt by not having it. PERFORMANCE:I'm running 100+ FPS all ultra (No ray tracing, not 4k) no issues, but drops to 40-60 in the city only. I've heard running on lower settings works well, especially for older hardware. Anecdotally; 1080p30fps smoothly on a GTX 1060! They said they're working on a way to reset your playthrough. Bizarre it didn't ship with that.That said the game itself is amazing. Brilliantly good fun. Very very little to complain about so far beyond what I've mentioned.",1

Positive,"Needs optimizing, but good game",1
Positive,"This game is solid so far. If you enjoyed the first Dragon's Dogma, then you'll probably like this one too. There's a couple of things that need to be mentioned though, so let's take it from the top:Performance is not great at the moment and unless you have a pretty beefy computer you might want to wait for them to patch the game before buying it.Microtransactions are a big talking point at the moment and tons of misinformation is being posted in regards to this. The short answer is don't buy the microtransactions because it's not worth it. The longer answer is that Capcom always add weird microtransactions like this into their games. Monster Hunter, Resident Evil and Devil May Cry have all had this exact thing happen. Hell even the first Dragon's Dogma had more or less the same microtransactions. Most important though is that the items are not worth buying for real world money since they are fairly cheap to just buy ingame with the ingame currency, be it appearance changes or fast travel items that you are going for. I don't know why people are getting angry about this for this game specifically when it's been just as bad in previous Capcom games.Once you have started the game you can't start a ""new game"". I agree this is a weird decision, but having played a ton of the first game I kinda understand the decision and I think other veteran player will as well given the importance of the Pawn network and also the NG+ and narrative to some extent. Not saying that's an excuse, because I can totally see why people would want to start over, but in cases where someone started a vocation they don't like or made a meme character and regretted it after a bit those are both things you can change pretty early in the game. If that still isn't good enough for you then the devs have been out saying that they are looking at adding ""new game"" to the main menu, so wait for that if it's important to you.With all of that out of the way let's get into the game. If you have played Dragon's Dogma then you know exactly what you are getting into. It's basically the old Dragon's Dogma, but those half-done features from back then seem more complete this time around. The game kind of seems like it's almost a remake of the first game, but set in a new world. I assume that it's going with the story stuff that can be seen by completing Bitterblack Isle in the first game, which might explain this. When that is said you don't really need any knowledge of the first game to get into this one.In case you are new to Dragon's Dogma I would suggest watching others play for a bit before grabbing it, because it's trying a lot of things that other games aren't really doing. I would almost call it a weird amalgamation of Monster Hunter, Dark Souls and Shadow of the Colossus in what it tries to accomplish but with its own flourish to make it feel unique. It's definitely not for everyone, but if you like seeing devs try to break new ground in games like I do, then this one might be for you.To reiterate, there's a good game here but also lots of misinformation being spread in regards to the microtransactions available for the game. The game does have performance problems, but usually Capcom are pretty quick to patch their games. Enjoy the game and finish the cycle of eternal return, Arisen.",1
Positive,"dlcs are optional people, get over it. i would advise against buying them, because they are making the game to easy.the game is fun, the game is jank, the game is pretty much a sequel to dragons dogma 1, the game is unique. i love it.my only gripe is the terrible performance, sadly. it's still a playable, great game though.",1
Positive,"I may post a more detailed review about the game itself in the future. So far it's going really well, not sure why so many people are posting negative reviews.The microtransactions are things you can obtain in the game, so there's no need to buy them. Odd choice of Capcom to make, but negligible nonetheless. Performance is perfectly fine at 120 FPS, just took a little bit of tweaking, as almost any AAA game does on PC. If you're getting bad performance, you most likely either don't have the hardware needed, or you need to tweak something. I'm sure there are going to be some outliers.The DRM issue is understandable, but it doesn't deserve a negative review strictly for that, especially when 5 devices can use the same copy rather than just 1. Unless DRM ends up affecting mods, I don't see this affecting the vast majority of people.I've also heard that you can't delete a save file. That simply isn't true. Granted, it isn't nearly as obvious as it should be, but it's entirely possible as you can see in other reviews. Google it if you need help.There may be other issues I'm unaware of, but so far it seems like most of the people reviewing this negatively are doing so for one or more of the above reasons. It feels like a weird bandwagon situation.",1

Positive,"Really enjoyed the game! Comparing it to the first one its 100 times better!Played for 12 hours yesterday and felt like 2. I think most of the negative reviews here are from people that didn't play the first one and were expecting something different and complaints about the VERY OPTIONAL ""dlc"" purchases which are not needed at all. Everything there can be obtained in game without any extra irl purchases.Super worth if you liked the first one.",1
Positive,"Fun and engaging game, travelling isn t boring and you can find some cool areas and loot. The pawns can do unexpectedly interesting actions and your actions have impact on the game state. The micro transactions are useless not sure why anyone would buy them.Frame rate dips bad in the big cities which is especially bad at 120hz, haven t tried some of the tricks mentioned though.So far this is a great game if you have a powerful system or if you can tolerate below 40fps in cities. I would not expect them to fix this issue for a long while.",1
Positive,"Right now not recommended. The gameplay is fun and the quests are good its DD1 with more stuff and more to do which is exactly what i wanted. But. the optimization is garbage. I have a i9 and 3080 and the game never pushes either to even 50% when running it at 1440p on high. Yet in the capital im running at 40fps half the time and out in about at 60fps. There are microtransactions though I would recommend you avoid them because they are a waste of time unless for some reason you want to waste your money. At this point the trash anti cheat system that on here has already had access to my stuff enough times through other games that I dont care about it. Its still trash though and might be half the reason the game runs like garbage. Wait till they fix the optimization.EDIT: They fixed the optimization for the game, its not perfect but its alot better. If you liked DD1 this is more of that with even more flavor. Due to the optimization improvements making the game playable even though i played it with the terrible performance I am changing this game to recommended.EDIT 2: Unless your shawn, dont buy it.",1
Positive,"This is in third times i've changed my mind about the game. Yes, this game currently has a huge number of problems, that's a fact. But in the end I still want to leave a positive review. Awesome game. You want to live in this game, you want leveling up all the vocations, do all the quests and explore every corner of this huge, wonderful, living world. As soon as you sit down to play and don t notice how time flowes by. you feel that the game was made with soul, I think I ll spend hundreds of hours on it.For me the main pain in the ass was the controls, since I play on a keyboard it's something that you need to get used and figure out. but then everything is fine.I recommend not to rush through main story and enjoy each region, you won t regret.",1

Positive,"Lol. what's up with all those microtransaction whiners?Just play the game and get all those ""DLC-items"" (excluding the Dargon's Dogma 1 music i guess) easily with ingame-currency you earn during regular gameplay.For the game itself: it's a less clunky Dragon's Dogma with fancier graphics. So if you loved/hated the predecessor most likely the same applies to Dragon's Dogma 2.",1
Positive,"My review after 4.5 hours of playing, this review is listed as a thumbs up but it's more like a in the middle.I haven't experienced much crashes or bugs, but I know my experience is not what it is for the vast majority of players currently.Gameplay is the same if not better than the first game, which is phenomenal because I hate when game developers change up how their game works. Exploration is fun and there's ton of stuff to do. The open world is massive. In the beginning you are tasked to head to the capital, you can either follow a guy and instantly transport there or you can walk your ass across the damn continent. Now I'm dumb and didn't realize I could fast travel with the guy, so I walked across the map. It was actually a lot of fun though! Performance currently is not ideal to say the least, I am running a 2080 and a Ryzen 9 3900x and I'm getting 50fps in open world and 30fps in cities. It's not ideal but technically still playable. Obviously this is a deal breaker to most people so just be patient and wait till performance patch comes up before buying.Micro transactions are nothing new in Capcom games unfortunately but there's a lot of misinformation spreading about it. Every item in the micro transaction store is obtainable for free in game. The items also do not take a lot of effort to obtain either. It's just a slimey way for Capcom to earn an extra buck on impatient people. Do I agree that the micro transactions are in place? No, but they are never thrown in your face in game at all luckily.Hopefully Capcom can get all these issues sorted out quickly because it's sad to see an actual good game suffer due to the negligence of the developer not making sure the game would perform well out of the box.",1
Positive,"Game is good, Gamers are insufferable",1
Positive,"Game runs fine, and will run even better after a handful of patches, and every capcom game has micro transactions. This is just review bombing.",1
Positive,"so far I've played 9ish hours of DD2 played about a 50 hours it is a good-sized map, it makes it feel larger with a feeling that every corner you run into theirs a typical reason why its there. The pawn system is back from the first game and is heavily used in this game, you can recruit 3 at a time and gun around with a mixed team of archers, swordsmen, and mages. The story is a little slow to take off but quicker than Star-field. The music is pretty good and would put it on par with Skyrim as I have yet to hear one track I did not like. The graphics are pretty and very nice to look at as it uses all the latest PC tech as you got everything from Ray Tracing and DLSS as well as AMD s FSR.The Enemy NPCs throwing rocks that behave based on attacks from you or other larger mobs like Goblins will legit throw rocks off ledges at you but sometimes the rocks weigh more and they fall off. All the large mobs feel like a true threat and make you backpedal if you run into them on accident, while smaller mobs can overwhelm you if you are not grouped right.Friendly NPCS are a mixed bag on current use of brains they on one hand will shout out where a chest is located but at the same time will give no indication and where it is. Currently, I think the biggest grip, and respectfully so, is the FPS, from the first area you start I ran anywhere from 59fps to 112fps and when I entered the main city I dipped into the 30s to low 40s at the time. I believe this to be from a combo of Bad Coding and the use of Denuvo as it doesn't even use my CPU or GPU properly and I rock a 4090 and 12700k and kind of teetertotters on both of them attempting to use it but then draw itself back causing spiking in the FPS.Oh and Micro Transactions on a $70 single-player game is a certified bone-headed old-guy businessman trying to think of a get-rich-quick moment. Like yeah right, my guy.If you are on a budget wait for a sale as this game will kinda burn or sting depending on your feelings towards new release games. If you enjoyed the first DD or enjoy classic RPG s you will most likely enjoy this game.",1

Positive,"I know a lot of people are upset about various things like the ingame shop and the save file, I totally get it, but I am having so much fun and it's running really smoothly.The Pawns are fun and they feel real and clever (even if they get stuck behind a boulder and you have to go get them).I love the gameplay, it takes a bit to learn and defo need to work on it more to master it, but I'm getting places (although the Gryphon decided to flee after 20 minutes of combat and then it was dark and all hell broke loose).Overall I am really happy with the actual game, only had one crash.Some of the animations, like the faces/lip synch are a bit iffy but I really don't mind at all and I feel great playing it, just like when I did playing BG3, not the same in many ways but I love the vibe and the story and combat so far.I will definitely recommend to anyone at my current point of experience with the game, especially if you can look past the deal breakers like Shop/Animation/One save that you can't delete or change or start new/performance (which isn't a case for me on high and have a fairly old spec but the GPU)I also really like the online Pawn system, feels nice and inclusive and very interesting to see what other people have done with their main Pawn.All in all I'm very happy ^^FYI, leaving meat in a city or an Inn is how you get ants",1
Positive,I have been having a blast and my main gripe is with the performance issues. I have a R9 5900x/ RTX 4090 combo and this game struggles to hold 60 FPS at 4K in cities. In the wilderness I get 80-120 fps. I haven't felt the need to spend money on micro-transactions. This is a work in progress review and I will update it as I play.,1
Positive,"Game's super fun, I have 300+ hours in DD:DA & I can see myself sinking a huge chunk of hours into this game too. The game isn't perfect however, and it does have some flaws. The most significant being the current performance. I'm gonna try giving my take on some of these concerns:1. Performance: I currently have a 4070 Super and a Ryzen 9 5900X and was getting near constant 60 FPS in the wilderness on high settings. However, once arriving at the first major city I was getting 40-50 FPS with dips into the mid 30s. It's hard to try and excuse this when any testing done with high end rigs would have shown this to be a common problem.2. No new game option: I sincerely hope this was a major oversight because if this decision was intentional it would be foolish, plain & simple.3. Microtransactions: All of the current items being offered are able to be obtained in-game without spending any real world currency. They are not paywalling any features, like many are claiming with the character edits (Art of Metamorphosis) or fast traveling (portcrystals). Simply playing the game for a few hours will have you obtain most of these items naturally. I haven't felt pressured into buying any of these items because I'm getting them anyways just by playing.Overall I am enjoying the game a lot & really happy with how it came out. Just hoping that they address the performance issues with a patch ASAP. Capcom has recently written an update post at the time of my review acknowledging these concerns as well but have addressed it with ""looking into ways to improve performance in the future"". It currently seems only time will tell how far into the future it will be.",1
Positive,"Great game, the mtx ingame are stupid and unnecessary, they are not needed and are only there to create bad publicity.",1
Positive,"Most of the issues other reviewers have mentioned relates to the microtransactions in the game. however the game game doesn't prompt you to spend any money unlike the newer Assassin's creed games, nor do they make their UI to push players to spend any irl money. The worst thing i've seen in this game is the DLC for character editor, this should not have been a paid feature, by far the scummiest thing CAPCOM has ever done.The game also doesnt allow you to create and use more than 1 main character. In an RPG, this is such two steps forward 1 step back moment, there is no reason players should be denied the chance to create a new character and experiment with it as they please.Even with its woes, it is still one of the best RPG games I've played, Dragons dogma's series always had a fantastic magic system and it still remains here, I'm almost certain the vast negative reviews left by players haven't played it nearly enough the grasp the game. Performance with 3060 with DLSS is amazing, no stutters at all.",1
Positive,"Ok, so the game is awesome. It feels like DD1 but different enough. Combat is different and feels a bit like an MMO, but good nonetheless.To address the complaints regarding the game first, it has ""micro transactions"" and about 21 DLCs. Most of the items the DLC offers can be obtained in-game. Rift crystals are used to modify your character's appearance and change the main pawn's inclination (personality). Wakestones serve as revives and a portcrystal is a teleportation point (useless without a ferrystone, which is not sold for money, but sold in-game in the capital).The art of metamorphosis is purchasable in the capital, and the Gaol Key can be purchased in the first encampment.So, is the game pay to win? Not really, you can buy 5 wakestones, which are not that useful since you can save all the time. But one might argue that the rift crystals do break a bit of the game and I agree. They can be used to recruit stronger pawns in the rift, and I do not agree, regardless, all the other DLC I do not have any problems with. But again, is not like rift crystals cannot be found in game.Other than that, having only one save is a real bummer, but not that different from what was intended on DD1.So far I have not encountered any bugs, game runs smoothly (my PC meets the recommended specs)",1
Positive,"The game looks beautiful! If you are a big fan of Dragon's Dogma you will love this game.Yes, it has little problems like most of the AAA games on day one, it will be fixed and you know it. I have a Ryzen 5 2600 (it's even inferior to the minimum system requirements) and RX 5500xt and the game is running pretty well in medium/high settings. I KNOW MY SYSTEM LIMITATIONS and I'll not complain about small fps drops on specific moments or the lack of exaggerated details on a tree that is 300 feet far from where my character is. I will see the game with better graphics when I manage to have better hardware and that's it. KNOW YOUR LIMITATIONS!The microtransactions are the same as the first game, JUST PLAY THE GAME! Rift crystals drop while you play the game, everywhere, your Pawns will bring you tons of it when they come from other worlds.If you don't need video games to fill the void of your lack of interaction with the real world, buy the game, you gonna love it.",1
Positive,"Here's an actual first impression for those interested in more than just the review bombing for various reasons:Microtransactions: The actual items aren't even worth the value they ask for. Wakestones are easily farmable from adventuring with random pawns you find on the streets, this is literally just playing the game with party members. Rift cristals are mainly used to hire pawns that are higher level than you which isn't all that useful if you're actually interested in playing the game yourself. They are also used to buy the thing you need to edit your appearance. Easily gotten from bigger monsters and you'll have way more than you'd ever need by the end of the game. Resident Evil 4's microtransactions are way worse, you can literally buy upgraded weapons there but apparently that's praiseworthy judging but the review score.Performance: I've had no crashes but the framerate seems to struggle with lots of npcs around, this is mainly in towns where it doesn't matter too much but I can understand not liking it and it can affect combat. This is a fixable issue but that doesn't necessarily mean Crapcom will fix it.Regarding not being able to start a new game, this is false but at the moment it requires deleting your own save file while disabling cloud sink. As for having just 1 character that's how DD is. Again, fixable and it really shouldn't be like this.There's also Denuvo and all the shit that brings with it, also a high price. As for the game itself it's pretty alright, the movement system feels worse because they added a lot of assisted movement stuff like auto climb, slide and your character stopping on the edge of a cliff but otherwise it plays just like DD1. There are only 4 skill slots now but some things that were previously skills have been moved to core skills aka always on. Thieves lost their bows and Archers lost their daggers but Warriors seem to be a lot better now. Mages obviously suffer from having less skill slots but they deserve it. I haven't gotten to the advanced vocations yet.The world has been fun to explore, the seeker tokens are back and they've been multiplying like crazy. Good Ol' Greggy's back too and he steal your heart in a heart beat but even the first battle against him lets you climb on his back like the ape you really are. Overall the business side is shit, the performance is questionable but the game itself is fun.",1
Positive,"found a hole, started climbing down it, and all my pawns decided to just fall to their death.best game ever 10/10",1
Positive,"i find these Downvotes so ridiculous! if you have a brain, you know that big games can have issues the first few days. until they fix what needs to be fixed. to much crying doesn't help.",1
Positive,"You can expect to complete the Main Story while exploring the majority of the world within 60 hours.Unfortunately, there are many mentally-challenged beasts discoursing legitimate discussion of the game with their misinformed tantrums about the micro-transactions and their obsession with Dark Souls.The game boasts an engaging combat system and an immersive world to explore with zero loading screens, and mechanics that while annoying, enhances the immersion of the world. This game is great for those who enjoys a generic, grounded fantasy world to explore (like myself).General weaknesses of the game include-Poor enemy variety. Expect to fight the same 11 types of monsters for the entirety of your playthrough. Rarer monsters should be more frequently spawned to increase enemy variety.-Outdated system and settings. Performance issues and low Field of View (FOV) is a sore pain-point throughout the game.-Poor exploration rewards. For most of the game, exploration rewards are lackluster and diminishes the excitement of opening a chest upon solving a puzzle or defeating a cave boss.The game has a very weak early-game experience due to the following reasons:1. Poor rewards for exploration, as every item within Vermund found through exploration is either a potion, Wakestone shard, or an equipment that is already sold by vendors in Vernworth. (With the exception of Ancient Battleground area.)2. Poor main story quest experience. Captain Brant standing in the tavern and dishing out 8 main story quests in a row, while you play as the errand boy-king of Vernworth is not an engaging experience.Rating for Early-Game (5/10)The game improves on the road to Bakbattahl with heavy emphasis on the dangers of the desert area. 1. Mob density and variety heavily improves in this area, and caves are condensed into a tight area unlike Vermund, which has massive distances between caves. 2. You can expect more unique equipment and most materials are found here in Battahl. Away from the boring political and spy quests in Vernworth, the questing experience here is more bearable, but still mediocre. There is nothing to write home about the questing in Battahl.Rating for Mid-Game (7/10)At this point in the game, it is roughly 30 hours into lacking questing experiences, and manageable exploration experiences. The Excavation Site is one of the game's shortest segments, with almost no caves or exploration in the region. This place has only the sole purpose of being a gateway into the main story's ending experience.Should one reach the ending at this point, the overall experience would be quite lacking, but passable due to the game's strong gameplay, world-building, and self-found exploration experiences.What elevates Dragon's Dogma 2 into a Recommended status would be the post-True Ending experience, which is an awe-inspiring and one of the best gaming experiences. The premise and danger of this final segment is what brings the game into Great status.",1
Positive,"I recommend the game, I don't recommend you listen to whiners.Game runs fine here, ultrawide 1440p above 70fps in open world, only dips to 50 in capital (where there's no combat, just npc talking, so 100% playable), and my config is R5 7600 + rtx 3070. All high, rt off.So performance wise is very playable with RT off, people who WANT to actually play can play fine, the other people only want to complain that the game doesn't run 8k max with rt, just ignore the fools.About microtransactions, they're 100% obtainable ingame. Especially RC itens are very easy to come by, there's not even cosmetic dlc, you don't need anything from dlc store, you will NEVER need anything, they're there for the stupid rich impatient people.And about the game, this is the true Dragon's Dogma. Plays similar to the first game, but feels better, the story so far is very good and intriguing, the visuals of the open world are wonderful, this is the best game to release this year so far.",1
Positive,"Incredibly fun and a great successor to the first game. I will recommend it IF you have insane specs on your PC, otherwise wait for a while until they update an optimize the game. Gorgeous sprawling landscapes that are reminiscent of Shadow of The Colossus, and the weapon skills and combat are a huge improvement over DD1. I understand negative reviews for the optimization, no lie it is absolutely terrible for most hardware that isn't up to date. However, the microtransactions are absolutely inconsequential and all of them are items you can easily find in game. This is pretty par-for-the-course for CAPCOM monetization, useless crap you can already get in the game, same as the DMC 5 and RE4 remake (OP weapons you can already get just by playing the damn game) Both games rated Overwhelmingly Positive, btw. I think that this kinda thing is more for audiences like Korea where microtransactions are far more accepted and commonplace. They're absolutely not crucial to the experience whatsoever, and would honestly just be lame to buy by making the game baby-mode. Too much misinformation is being spread about the game and its ""predatory microtransactions"". You do not have to pay money to change your appearance. You simply buy the item that allows you to do so in the FIRST BIG TOWN of the entire game.",1
Positive,"Amazing game, combat is addicting, the world design is immaculate, npcs feel alive, even running on low graphics the game looks gorgeous. played a 10 hour session after it launched because i couldn't bring myself to hop off 10/10, only thing i would change is giving us transmogs for our equipment. Side note to all the people complaining about micro transactions. Play the game, there is literally a shop in the main town next to the rift crystal, and performance issues are there but the stutters are not bad and i've never experienced any during combat plus it will more than likely get patched, Stop review bombing because your comparing this to the likes of elden ring >:(",1
Positive,"So far the gameplay is everything it'd hoped for from a DDDA sequel. The Microtransactions are pretty much the same as what capcom did with the first game. Rift crystals can be gained easily by playing, character customisation post-creation can be done with gold, or using rift crystals. Dlc items can be found in-game.Performance can be a bit disappointing, most areas I get around 50-70 FPS on a 3060TI and 5800X3D, performance dips upon entering a new area but quickly stabilises. It does dip below 60 at times, I can personally overlook it after playing the original game way back with the 30fps lock; though it'd be preferred if it was at least a stable 60.Here's hoping patches can improve performance in the coming days, other than that the game has been worth the wait.",1
Positive,"great game, It is so addictive!ignore all the MTX, you can play the game just fine without it. overall 9/10 from me so far",1
Positive,"pretty much what i wanted and expected from a dragons dogma sequel!PC optimisation seems quite rough, especially in towns. make sure u fine tune ur settings accordingly.stay off of the online store, u dont need it. (tssk tssk, naughty capcom!)",1
Positive,"Do I expect a fully functional game at release?Yes, always. But I also understand that this is nearly impossible. The more diverse and complicated or sophisticated our systems get, the more impossible it gets to predict and identify any problem that could arise before release. Every dev team that manages to roll out a smooth release on this scale of the game, has my utter respect! I am currently 8 hours into the game, and I am enjoying it.The combat feels way more fluent than before and some actions of enemies and npc's are just plain hilarious.Like a club with a guard attached, suddenly flying through my screen and smashing into a wall.Pathfinding at some places is still a bit wonky. You may find you're pawns grouped up and dancing in circles to. I dunno. summon an old one to serve them pasta or something.While the game is rather resource-hungry, especially on the graphics RAM, it runs smoothly on my system. Win10/3800x/1660super/16gb - Lowest settings, to be fair. The one thing I'm not sure I like is, that the game does not let you create a new savegame. If you ever click ""Start Game"", you are stuck with that savegame for now. Maybe that will finally help me stick to one savegame. Maybe not. I also think the in-game menu is visually overloaded, but that does not really impact anything. There also is a lot of negative energy for the character change voucher that one may buy in the steam shop for two rubies. That is absolute bullshit because you can actually buy that one ingame for ingame currency too. -So to summarize:Is it fun? Yes, absolutely.Should you buy it? I cannot tell you what you should do, but I would advise waiting a while for them to iron out some errors and stuff. While it runs smoothly on my system, I see a lot of posts about performance issues.Honestly, the usual.",1
Positive,"Everyone who has played DD1 knows that the MTX items aren't P2W and can be obtained in game completely free. You're basically paying for convenience. Not sure why this is such a big contention point for a game that is single player.Performance issues are definitely unacceptable however this is something that will be fixed. I'm currently playing with frame gen using a mod and it's a game changer. Open world is incredibly smooth and I went from 60 fps in the main city to 120fps. Once frame gen is officially implemented I imagine most complaints about performance will be resolved. Aside from these issues, this sequel is just more of the same things that made DD1 so great. Amazing combat, a unique pawn system, and meaningful gear progression. It adds upon the original with more intriguing quests and a huge immersive world. Give it some time for all the issues to be resolved and the experience will be worth it.",1
Positive,"So far, so good. If I hadn't read these reviews I wouldn't even have known there was an issue.If you aren't using a 4090, I'd say wait for a patch for the performance.Microtransactions suck but you can just ignore them. You don't need any of them, just play the game. They're entirely whale bait.Overall, if you can run it, I'd recommend it. Gameplay is a blast. Combat in particular. Feels like the familiar DD1 combat, but with more fluidity and dynamic moves that can happen depending on what's going on when you attack. Even fighter is a blast this time around. Pawns feel way more useful and less annoying than DD1.EDIT: 38 hours in, finished the game, would highly recommend it. Game was a blast all the way through. I do wish there was more enemy variety (particularly large enemies), but that's my only real complaint about it. Didn't think about the microtransactions a single time, so again, just ignore the whale bait and have a great time playing the game.",1
Positive,Amazing honestly never expected another game like this to exist after dragons dogma.But the performance issues do hinder the experience greatly even if you meet the specs recommended. I loved playing through the game but there is a substantial lack of things and QoL that dark arisen brought along with the first dragons dogma. I want bitter black isle so bad. The end game is so easy and the game is way too easy for experienced players.I would gladly pay a hefty sum as I am no miser for sure. Give actual content rather than micro transactions. A hard mode even. New game+ enemy spawns or scaling. Anything would be better than tricking players into thinking that these micro transactions are even remotely helpful or special. I want more of the game because games like this only come around once every 12 years.It's more than well worth it but it really isn't for everyone even with the performance issues being ignored. Overall a masterwork that barely works.,1
Positive,"The game seems to be getting review bombed by clueless people.1. The items available for purchase as DLC are all purchaseable items in game and are all very easy to acquire.2. You can start a new game by deleting your cloud save.3. You can change your appearance for 20k gold. For reference it costs 2500 gold to stay in an inn, which you do every day to rest. This money is easily acquired.With that out the way, the game is fun so far. Some fps complaints in high traffic cities but otherwise running fine.The review bombing seems to be unwarranted.========EDIT: Alright 60hours played, it's review update time.Game is good. Optimisation is poor. It's very CPU bound in cities.Microtransactions are just the equivalent of a premium bag of items. You don't need them, do not buy them, no seriously there's nothing worth buying anyway. Get it in game.Dragonplague does not break games people are spreading misinformation.Combat is some of the most cinematic and fun you can have.Very much enjoying the game. Enemy variety could be better. Gameplay loop won't be for everyone, it's an explorer's game and a traveller's game, if you can't live without fast travel mechanics it might not be for you.

Positive,"an absolutely incredible game. it's hard to believe something like this ever got made. it's a vast, high-budget AAA game that's utterly filled with jank, top to bottom, and sometimes borders on being an outright kusoge. but that's what makes it great. in a world filled with AAA games so droll and curated that you spend the entire game following a preset path between set activities, dragon's dogma 2 is an absolute mess of a game (affectionate) where you can get on a gondola, be attacked be harpies, and end up destroying the gondola, causing everyone to fall to their deaths into a volcano. or fighting a cyclops near a river and watching it accidentally fall off a cliff and into the rapids and die.seriously: don't play this game if you are expecting a game that will always ""work properly"". half the fun is the fact that it often does not, in hilarious and unexpected ways. remember, the first dragon's dogma was a game in which almost everyone ended up inadvertently romancing the shopkeeper because affection was based on how many times you talked to people. don't expect anything less jank from dragon's dogma 2 either.the exploration is extremely fun, something that very, very few games get right these days. if you want to have fun exploring a big world that begs you to see what's around the next corner, dragon's dogma 2 has your back.despite its flaws - and often precisely because of its flaws - this is probably going to end up being my game of the year. i'm going to miss the time i spent with it fondly, and i hope over time the mods come out to fill out its weaknesses (e.g. late-game enemy density being too high and difficulty being too low).don't buy any of the DLC items. they're all pointless, presumably added in because capcom management demanded the devs add DLC, so they added in things that you can get trivially in the game itself. if you want the ability to redesign your character freely even at the start of the game, or want less restricted fast travel, there's mods for that. use those. personally the only one i used was the free character redesigner, though.",1
Positive,"If you don't know anything about Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. Go and learn about it first. Everything is explained up front, and this game is not for everyone. It's not Elden Ring. It's not Skyrim. Go and research, then come back if you still want it.The game crashing is likely due to outdated drivers. Update your drivers before playing this game. This solved it for most people.You get one save. People complained for DD1. They didn't change it. They will likely not change it for DD2.Microtransactions are barely barely an advantage. Most everything is earnable in-game or replaced within a few hours, and DD1 even allowed you to change hair and tattoos for in-game coin. Even the item that allowed ALL changes to character was obtainable. I expect the same for DD2. DD1 also had the same laundry list of microtransactions. I never purchased one. Never felt a difference. If that's a show stopper for you, I understand completely. Please write your negative review. It all balances out to a better perspective in the end.The performance needs tuning. We're seeing frame rate stutters during save and consistent drop from 90 down to 30-40 around large groups of human NPCs.I capped my FPS to 60 and it did more to smooth out the FPS than any graphics option.-As for the good, the voice acting and map size were to two main concerns I had from DD1, and both are vastly improved.Combat is vastly improved. It feels more fluid and now it's actually dynamic. Attacks have multiple animations that are context sensitive. An enemy is below you, you attack down, you stab if they're on the ground, etc. The game IS harder, but only so. Don't commit to attacks too quickly and work as a team and you'll be fine. Basically, don't play like you're solo. Use everything you have available.Pawn chatter is vastly improved, and the pawns actually say things to each other that makes sense in context. They talk less and it's not the annoying level of DD1. UPDATE: Ok, it's annoying, but only that they repeat the same lines over and over. It's less often, but after 14 hours of gameplay. I get it. all my pawns are women this time. I get it, we're all different classes. Ok. I get it, we have every race and gender this time. And on and on.-So if you know what you're getting into, ignore microtransactions existing, and are willing to play while they iron out the performance, then go ahead and buy.Otherwise, don't buy.If you want to be one of the ones to stand up against all microtransactions. Don't buy. Downvote. Do what you can. I'll agree with you on every well-researched honest point. Microtransactions that create an unfair advantage, no matter how small are bad.",1

I'd still wait until a patch comes out, since so many people are having issues. Pretty much all of the microtransactions are optional; there is no need to buy any of them to make progress in the game, and many of the items are available in the game (as is seen in the item descriptions on Steam). Yes, this includes the book that lets you change your character's appearance; you don't have to spend $1.99 on it. Check the DLC's description. Also, many of the microtransactions are part of the deluxe edition. You don't have to engage with the DLCs at alll; they are simply a way you can **choose** to support the game and advance your progression slightly. Denuvo is inexcusable.

I don't really count my frames but i notice the occasional stutter but it actually runs pretty smooth. Had to slow down a bit to follow the story but its pretty nice! I haven't actually seen any of the Micro Transactions I saw a lot of negative reviews for. Not sure if I'm oblivious to them but I've just been playing the game and haven't been prompted to spend more money on anything. Only complaint so far is I'm having trouble seeing my friends pawns when searching in the rift for them.

Positive,"I said I was going to update the review to a positive one once they added the New Game option and fixed most of the bad performance issues. Overall, the game still doesn't run on a stable framerate, though at this point I can only think this is due to my CPU not meeting the requirements and having the minimum required of RAM, I can say that the game now had a substantial improvement and got slightly smoother with DLSS.The game obviously is not bad, it's actually really great. But, when a great product like this, lacks such basic things, people will get mad, and with reason.Finished my first playthrough, and I can easily say that this game is a huge improvement compared to the first one, although it misses certain mechanics and stuff that was really nice in the first game and could be here too, still is an awesome experience.",1
Positive,"After 30 hours, I can safely say this game is a fantastic sequel. It builds upon the first in some fantastic ways, the biggest improvement here is exploration which is satisfying and much more in-depth than in the first game.Combat, questing, progression systems are all top tier. Emergent gameplay is really great, too. The game, at its core, is fantastic.Yes, the game has technical issues that need to be smoothed out. You can use a couple of very easy to install mods if you own a 4000 series card to implement both Frame Generation and DLAA. I've done both, and I've doubled my FPS (even in cities I'm over 70 now) and improved IQ a great deal. You can even use a couple of mods to implement FSR frame generation too. Of course, a game shouldn't need modding to get into a playable state, and I understand the issues people have with a game releasing like this.The MTX situation. just like most other modern Capcom titles, this game includes MTX that can be entirely ignored and your gameplay will not be affected in any way. After 30 hours I've not felt the need to even glance at the DLC list with a desire to buy anything. They just announced a patch that will be adding a New Game option, so that part will be fixed soon. The rest are all items that you can 100% ignore and you will not have a lesser experience as you can earn all of the DLC items and service in-game very easily.I'm recommending this game but /only/ if you're someone who doesn't mind installing a couple of mods to get the performance up to par. If you don't want to do that, or if you have older hardware that you think could struggle based on feedback, then 100% avoid for now and wait for updates.I have a 5700x / 4070 system, far from the best but good enough to get the game running with the aforementioned mods with 70-130fps in all areas (the dips to 70 only occur in cities), and that's more than playable for me. The game itself is fantastic and well worth your time. I can only hope Capcom work hard to bring the game to a play able state for those who cannot play currently.",1
Positive,"Idk why I said DD2 story was better than base DD1. The startup to the story was better, but the entirety of it was lacking, unfortunately. Gameplay is also kind of at odds whether it's better or worse than DD1, due to having less action slots for certain weapons, and classes that don't quite feel as good as Magick Knight did._oldBeat the game with 88h playtime. Didn't see everything there was to see. However:If you feel DD1 needed a better story, you'll like DD2If you felt (somehow) that DD1 needed better gameplay, you'll like DD2If you felt Dark Arisen story was too weak, liking DD2 dependsIf you felt Dark Arisen wasn't hard enough, DD2 will feel even easierOverall a great game and its base state is significantly better of a package than DD1 was, as much as I love DD1 and will definitely revisit despite DD2 being out, as both are fantastic enough of their own merit to play.Biggest downside of DD2, QoL/performance aside, is how easy it is to mess up some quests or miss them altogether. But much else makes up for it. Trust in the process._old4790kgtx 108016gb ramdid all my graphics adjustments before starting. I get near 50 fps in the field and 20 fps in the main city. the 20fps doesn't feel as bad as it does in armored core 6, and as it doesn't matter it doesn't perturb me much. game took a few min to launch and then roughly 8min to do its shader processes. Haven't crashed yet and nothing inhibiting the actual gameplay other than it being too easy to talk to npc's or when npc's auto talk to me. If people are making it out to be unplayable, either their system is wonk af or some other stuff.the only thing I dislike in DD2 thus far is the lack of QoL in menu interfaces. The crafting list doesn't let you skip to the next page when pressing right/left, you can't auto equip stored gear compatible with the swapped-to vocation upon swapping, you can't sell items in your storage when speaking with merchants, you can't buy and send things purchased from merchants to your storage. basically have to do a dance to get everything settled for each outing.",1
Positive,"The negative review bombs on this game are insane and by the looks of most them, people crying over little knowledge.Ignore the DLC, it's just more of DD1. If you played that you know what you're getting yourself into. I haven't encountered any bugs or glitches in my playtime so far and I have everything set on Max with some very minor frame drops in high scenarios.",1
Positive,"Bruh they released micro-transactions alongside the release of the gameIN A SINGLE PLAYER GAME ?How sad did this turned out to be, and I was looking forward to this.RefundingEdit: Nvm this game is fun lol",1
Positive,Dragon's Peak 216 hours in: Still peak,1
Positive,"Gameplay 10/10OST 10/10Story is good but the true ending is kinda trashcan't sex your main pawn, -10Money well spent tbh",1
Positive,You can tell who hasn't played the first game by the reviews alone,1
Positive,Everybody bitching about the microtransactions probably never really played the first game. all the rift crystals and junk you don't really need. Port crystals you don't need.Wakestones you don't really need if you don't go murderhobo everyone. XD Just basic skill issue mess.I can understand whining about 'oh noez my FPS dips'. but for anybody that's played the first Dragon's Dogma this game is just more of the first game we loved for years.,1
Positive,"You can freaking dap up your pawns.Edit (3/24/2024):After putting 30 hours into this game, I believe I'm at the point where I can give this game a proper review. This game has a lot of negative reviews and criticisms, and I want to say that many of them are valid. First being the price point of $70: As a Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen player with 300 hours, I'm certain that I will get my money's worth with the amount of time that I will sink into this game, however the skepticism that other players have when they see this price tag and that's completely understandable. As it is right now, I cannot say that this game is worthy of that price. Wait for a sale or get it off a key site, but until they fix the issues with this game, this is not worth $70. Also the microtransactions, while a choice that has been met with much scrutiny, does not bother me. Denuvo and performance: Denuvo is anti-piracy, anti-tamper, and anti-performance. Denuvo for a singleplayer game puts a frown on my face. Simple as. Hopefully they remove it in the future, maybe a year or two down the line. In the meantime, if you haven't played Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen yet, I would recommend you play that. As for performance; it is abysmal for the quality. 30-40 frames in cities, 50-70 out in the open world. I have an AMD 5600G, 3060 ti, and 16 GB of RAM. Not the best but I get higher framerates on Cyberpunk 2077 with higher settings than I do this game with lower settings. By the time of this review the devs have already addressed this and are supposedly working on improvements. If your computer struggles to run games, do NOT buy this game unless you are willing to trudge through horrible performance or if they patch it. Gameplay and features: There are a lot of mechanics and features in the previous game that carried through to the sequel, and many that didn't. First I want to go over what didn't (at least what I cared to note):- Less armor customization (no more arm and clothing options, just head, torso, and legs)- Certain vocations ( Ranger, Assassin, and Mystic Knight are out and Strider has been split between Thief and Archer )- Less skill slots (four compared to the previous game's six, though this is big for the Warrior class)- Vocation specific stat leveling (now it doesn't matter what class you play as, your stats will change accordingly)- Selling items directly from storage- Buying items and sending them directly to storage- Quest boards (as far as I know)- Certain pawn inclinations (haven't messed with this one much, though it seems to be streamlined)- Still only one save slot.New or refined mechanics:- Character customization (the original game already had a robust system, and it's even better now! However perhaps due to the graphical fidelity, some may find the newer models ugly)- Pawn interactions (I actually use the commands now and the ability to guide you to points of interests is great)- Fighting big monsters is a lot more fun!- Throwing barrels/stones/people/corpses!- Crafting system (a mechanic mostly overlooked in the original game that is now useful and encouraged)- Loss gauge (reduced maximum health after taking damage until rest)- Camping out (new feature; gives buffs and allows for changing skills on the road, also useful for managing the loss gauge)- New vocations! (Mystic Spearhand, Trickster, and Wayfarer)- Improved vocations! (Warrior is so much fun!)- Health/stamina curative hotkeys- New biome!- Freaking cat people!- Wilhemina! Conclusion: If you have money to spend, have a decent enough PC or willing to suffer low FPS, and really want to experience Dragon's Dogma again, I say go for it like I did.If you are concerned about performance, pricing, and Denuvo and have some patience, wait a year or two.If you are new to the series, play Dark Arisen first.",1
Positive,"Dragons Sugma 2The game is poorly optimized, getting 100 fps if im lucky on a 4090 and ryzen 9 7950x3d and 64gb of 6400mhz ddr5 ram, otherwise greats so far visually and story wise. Wish it was better optimized. Don't get me started on the 30fps on console.",1
Positive,"Just getting the taste after the official launch of Dragon's Dogma 2 and so far, i really love it.the game looks beautiful but Capcom really needs to refine their PC ports, every new game launch is always a bad framerate fest.i still can't believe DD2 is finally here, Thank you Itsuno and the team for making another Fantastic game!",1
Positive,"Really mixed here. All of the MTX complaints are people who obviously never played the game as all of those items can easily be obtained in game. The game and game play are AMAZING however. My largest complaint is the seriously poor optimization. Would wait to buy until they iron out the performance issues, but if you loved DD1/dark arisen, you will love this game.",1
Positive,"The game still need to be fixed at some point, I fell under textures once and optimization in this game is not good so far, I had to upgrade my GPU from rx 5700xt to rtx 4070 and now it's playable. But this game has such great potential! You definately will not regret buying it since gameplay as good as storyline and people who enjoyed such games as Dragon age, Skyrim, Witcher will definately gonna like it! Just give it some time to fix all remaining troubles",1
Positive,need a nasa computer for this mf,1
Positive,"The Good : Its Dragon Dogma but next genThe Bad : Its poorly optimized, filled with dubious decisions like the inability to start a new character and a shitton of overpriced yet useless DLCsDo i recommend it? Yeah but unless you really like the original DD(and in that case you already bought DD2) i'd advise to wait for a sale & some updates",1
Positive,"Wow, so much missinformation going on about this game, specially from people that never bought it, played it, or expended more than 1 hour in the game, anyways, yes, i do hate microtransactions in a singleplayer game, i have since DD1, yes, the game runs like ass (not on my rig but i know the overall performance on most computers is shit) and yes, Capcom is a shameless company, but still, is a great game, and i cannot judge YEARS of development for 1 things that doesn't affect me at all (you can actually change your appearence for free, travel stones and resurrect stones are quite common) and another thing that will get patched eventually, this game was NOT READY to be released, but since i bought it, i tried it, and i can confidently say that the game is good, not at the level of BG3, this is probably not GOTY material, is just good, enjoyable",1
Positive,"For all those review bombing this cause of the micro-transactions, get it together plz. Most things you can buy, come as part of the deluxe edition. Fast travel was not a huge part of the first game, nor is it a huge part of this game. It seems the micro-transactions are only a crutch for those who do not possess the skill to complete the game as designed. While I agree that it is not good business practice to throw that on us players last minute, I do believe they do not have any bearing on this specific game at all. Just get the game, play the game, ignore the micro-transactions, and thank me later. There is a list online that shows you how to get all micro-transaction items early on in the game if you are that hyper obsessed over it. There is absolutely no need to purchase any of these things. At it's core, this game is excellent.",1
Positive,"This is one of those games that game designers will be talking to each other about and taking inspiration from for the next decade. I don't think it will come as a shock to anyone to say that open world games are in dire need of a refresh and Dragon's Dogma 2 experiments with and refines every aspect of that classic design, from the way fast travel works, to the the way quests and NPC companions work, don't get me wrong a lot of these systems are evolutions of systems seen in the first game and in other games, but here it feels like they're all considered parts of a whole.Not all of these experiments turned out perfect, specifically with encounter design, they're probably too frequent and your Pawns don't always do a great job of dealing with flying enemies. Also, for a game with one of the best character creators I've ever used, its a real shame you can only create one Pawn yourself.But regardless of the ridiculous backlash this game has gotten, I believe people as a whole will come around to respecting this game for everything it tries and mostly succeeds in doing. Highly recommend to any fan of RPGs",1
Positive,"So after putting in about 12 hours, I thought it would be a good time to put in a review. I personally love the game, and there are some slight issues with the optimizations, but that is bound to be fixed. Yes, it does stink that games are being released ""Half A**"" these days, but it'll be fixed, and the game is still playable for me; at least I average 50-60 frames. But other than that main issue, I have not experienced any crashes or major bugs; I think the most bugs I've seen are funny rag dolls. In the 12 hours I've spent playing, I have not crashed once. Now for game play, the game feels amazing, looks amazing, the sound is amazing, the music is amazing everything is perfect about this game other than the CPU issues. Now for these ""micro transactions,"" people are acting like you need to buy these items to be able to play. In fact, you don't; you just need to play the game normally, and you unlock everything by just playing the game. I think the transactions themselves are for players who don't have much time these days to do full exportation due to family, work extra, and are to help them move along a little faster, but in reality, there is no reason to buy the ""DLC"" due to it all being able to be found in the game. So in my personal opinion, the game is great, and yes, there are some issues, but if you want to play the game, play it, or if you want to wait for the game to have a few patches, then wait to enjoy it. Overall, you will enjoy the game regardless!",1
Positive,"Im not going to look past this horrendous PC launch for this game. The fact it took 5 months for a proper patch to even have the game run above 40FPS on even the most powerful rigs is 100% unacceptable. With that being said, the patch fixed ALOT of the performance issues across the board. I can't speak for low-mid range PC's, but i have had very few issues on my 3080ti and 7800X3D hovering around 120 consistently outside major cities. Dogma 1 is easily in my all time top 10, its the perfect balance of borderline jank and brilliance that makes it such a unique experience. Dogma 2 is, and dare i say, BETTER than dogma 1's base game at the moment and so damn close to being better than the dark arisen DLC. Everything i loved about the first game is here but amplified x2, and it keeps enough of the jank to both annoy the fuck outa me and make me giggle like a girl. Climbing ontop of monsters and stabbing the hell out of them, unleashing visually impressive spells, dealing with pawns at their best and worst. The game oozes creativity that you get in a DnD night with a bunch of drunk friends.Its not all sunshine and Harpy boobs though. Traveling was a major issue in the first game, made worse without the infinite ferry stone before the enhanced edition. Dogma 2 is obviously MUCH MUCH BIGGER and SIGNIFICANTLY more dense than Dogma 1. Exploring a path can take you down a 5 hour rabbit hole which is awesome but not when you want to back track and sell or buy at a village. Portable port crystals are insanely rare, so the only checkpoints you get now are camp sites that allow you to full heal and assign already purchased vocations, but you still need to find a guild to augment or swap to entirely new vocations. You also can't sell or buy equipment unless you find a random merchant wandering around.So how does Capcom remedy this? D L C BABY! For only $3 you can BUY a port Crystal! So WHAT if the game was unplayable for 5 MONTHS AT LAUNCH!? So WHAT if the game is $70?! Just BUY AWAY BAD DESIGN! Dogma 1 before the remaster had very similar bullshit, so i'm not surprised, but it doesn't change the fact its complete and utter trash.I LOVE this game. Its 100% worth the wait for both the release AND the fixes, and despite all the DLC bullshit i mentioned, we got mods to fix that for free. If you loved Dogma 1, you're gona love this. The only missing piece is the incredible DLC that changed the entire flow of the game. PLEASE CAPCOM add a true roguelike mode to that DLC with randomized loot and encounters.",1
Positive,"I haven't posted many reviews, but feel compelled because the review bombing. Game is an overall step-up from the first. It's missing the difficulty that people expected from playing dark arisen, but i'm sure that will come with DLC and updates. People posting negative reviews about micro-transactions are going to kill any chance of this game getting DLC, updates, and a third installment. You don't need to buy any of the micro-transactions. You can earn everything relatively easy in-game.",1
Positive,"Great game, really enjoyed it so far. This game gave me sort of feeling when I played skyrim many years ago, not in a bad way but in sense of discovery, exploration and worldbuilding. The combat mechanic and gameplays itself are much improved from the previous games, attack feels heavy, animations are not janky like the previous game, and vocations feels different from each other. and of course magic is still cool like the previous games.There is con tho, the performance is kinda mixed bags. I have smooth gameplay in the open world but in the city I can dips into 40-35 when i play using 3080 on 4k using DLSS Quality mode. I'm fine with it since I mostly play console games at 30FPS anyway, But it need to be addresed since FPS is not really the main issue but the frametimes is.But Overall I really enjoyed my adventure so far despite the performance issue. I dont really mind with microtransactions or that many RC dlc you can get that RC relativily fast anyway by just playing the games. You use the RC to hire higher level pawn but its not really required to do so, you can just befriend that person and get that pawn for free anyway.",1
Positive,take your time and explore that is all,1
Positive,"This game is a good damn time, The frame drops are a little annoying but its never bellow 40 fps and its usually not often and I assume It will be ironed out over the next week or two.I am very happy with my purchase.",1
Positive,"It's alright. I couldn't feel the same charm I used to feel from DDDA, but I probably need more than 2 hours to have an accurate judgement anyway.It will be a blast to play this at 144 FPS in a decade once I build a PC that vastly outmatches the ""requirements"". Until then, I wait.",1
Positive,"Everything I hoped for from this sequel. Great game! All this nonsense about microtransactions, I've put 80+ hours in this game and dont even know how to access them. Havent seen them once. Zero performance issues, not one single crash, just hours of fun",1
Positive,"It's an excellent game. Don't let the haters fool you. There are mictrotransactions in a lot of singleplayer games. Both Resident Evil and Devil May Cry went unscathed in terms of this microtransactions topic, so I don't see why this game has to get all this abuse. It's all obtainable in the base game anyway.This game has great combat, fantastic music and is able to create core memories in your mind, that you as a player and a person, are gonna have with you for the rest of your life. Now to some agreement, I have come across some technical hick-ups here and there (Mostly the FPS being unstable). But I know that Capcom is hard at work with making this game run better with each passing day.I absolutely adore this game, and can't wait to go do another run. Please look past all the people jumping on the hate train, and actually play the game. You won't regret it!9/10",1
Positive,"Like the first game, DD2 is a flawed masterpiece with tons of amazing qualities and an equal amount of baffling design issues.Compared to Dragon Dogma 1, it has a much more explorable and compelling open world, on the level of Elden Ring. It's beautiful, incredibly immersive and every little cave can lead to hours of discovery and awe. Combat is as deeply satisfying as it ever was, if you're into its specific brand of weighty and chaotic clash of physicalized bodies.It also has the worst quest design I've ever seen, a dated HUD and menus (tedious inventory management), and a dire lack of challenge once you get around level 20. In that regard, the first game, with its linear story and corridor world design was a much tighter and challenging experience.",1
Positive,"Side note: can confirm all MTX is useless besides shortening the grind. Took me 20+ hours to get same amount of riftstones that could be bought for $1.99. Pretty sad but look at Far Cry series - same thing.In 40+ hours and feel like I've just scratched the surface.In town FPS tells me there are a few more updates until this is ready for GOTY edition. Occasionally frustrating old school RPG style of game, but always makes up for it with literally epic battles and scenery.Story is engaging but some side quests not so much. Voice acting is odd but enjoyable. Although seems like MTX has lowered drop rates to push purchases. 8/10 and climbing - wait for sale/update tho: release state is poor for a company this size (AKA Capcom, creators of Monster Hunter)",1
Positive,"Great game.Combat and exploration is a ton of fun.Most of the annoying parts can easily be fixed with a couple of mods.Would have been an easy GOTY contender if it weren't for the performance issues, putting the Bakbattahl portcrystal behind a paywall and the inability to switch weapons when you switch a class.",1
Positive,"I beat the game (Edit: and a different ending now too). The first area and main city are by far the worst part of the game for being very cpu intensive, after that the game runs pretty well. The mtx for portcrystals is ridiculous, having only found 2 throughout the main campaign (Edit: 4 more from: location on floor, mystical creature quests, and the elves; 6 total in first playthrough). The change appearance tokens kinda depends how often you need to change appearance else its 500 RC in the main city through the pawn shop vendor. Why do we still have 1 save file in 2024? Some areas are also really tedious to get through, spamming enemy packs that gank you every 2 minutes and having no nearby riftstones to resummon your pawns so it became a save scum adventure up a mountain only to fight a larger enemy after wasting curatives. Semi-spoilers below: Beating the game goes right into NG+, why? also no post-game content (like everfall in dd1) on release, why? I wanna finish up loose quests and then choose to ng+ damnit. Edit: The second ending I did was a lot harder but satisfying in terms of transitioning into ng+. It was a lot more difficult than the regular last boss and the stakes felt high. Is it worth the 95$ cad its priced at? Probably not unless you really liked DD1, which it is very much dragon my dogma (for better and for worse). Also third party key seller got me 20% off so at least there was that (and I didn't get ripped off).",1
Positive,"My 120FPS drops when I enter a city, and you have no control over the pawns other than go, return to me, and wait. I don't care for the microtransactions since you can gain everything just from playing; it's not that big of a deal. I built my PC four years ago and it runs better than most of yours.",1
Positive,my game stopped working after 30 hours of gameplay.it suddenly crushed.it wont lunch at start.PLEASE I NEED HELP. this is the first time im having these issues on STEAM platform.i bought this game 51 euros .,1
Positive,"Want to improve performance of the game? commit genocide of an entire city, groundbreaking, recommend",1
Positive,she be dragon on my dogma until I arisen,1
Positive,they should put dragonsplague in every single game,1
Positive,"It was hard to decide how to rate this game. I came back and changed it to a yes, even though there are some things about it I don't like:- Can't start a new character, if you already have one. - Only one save. If people want to play with one save make an ironman mode.- No difficulty settings, even though DD1 had them- Poor optimizationThe game's CC is amazing, probably the best part. I also think it looks really nice. Overall I like the game but some of the design choices I am not a fan of. Preference and taste.",1
Positive,"I travel 4 to 6 days a week for work, so my gaming system is a laptop and most of the time my connection is via Hotel networks.Intel Core i9-10900K CPU @ 3.70GHz64GB DDR4-SDRAM Dual ChannelNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 16GB1. This is not pay to win. You don't have to buy a thing, it's all accessible in game. 2. If you do not like your looks or your pawn, even after the demo character creator, you can alter one or both once you hit the main city. The item necessary can be purchased from NPC with RC that you should have more than enough to spend by that point in the game.3. 'New Game' or not able to delete / restart character. Dev already mentioned bringing the new game back. If you really wish to restart you can do so at the game folder level. 'How to' is readily available online. I back up all my save games anyway.4. Performance - with my setup, which may be considered a 'potato' by gaming 'elites', I have had little to no stuttering or performance issues. I am running latest video drivers.5. Gameplay - I am old school when playing on PC, so I use mouse. I use a razor Naga, so remapped accordingly. Every thing I need is under my thumb and game play is fine for me. I have this game also on PS5 for the rest of the family to enjoy while I am away. No complaints from their perspective either.I've looked forward to the next DD release. I've played the original game and dlc both on PC and PS3/4. I haven't been disappointed. Other players may not agree with my opinion. No worries, but if nothing else, if you are a new player to Dragon's Dogma, give the original a spin and see if it doesn't hook you in like it has the rest of us.",1
Positive,"Fun game, has some bugs and performance issues that should be improved on but otherwise it's a good fun game with deep RPG immersion.However, many reviews are giving the game a negative review and making a complaint about microtransactions being an issue.While i agree that microtransactions are bad, especially in a paid single-player game, all the microtransaction items can be effectively ignored as you can get every single one of those by playing the game.The only exceptions might be the deluxe order items (which give a starting bow, sword, shield and a camping kit). But again those items become irrelevant the moment a player progresses past the beginning part of the game and reaches the first major city where they can buy better gear and camping kits that outclasses the starting items.I think it's pretty unfair to review bomb and bash a game for obviously poorly thought out greedy monetization practices by the company, Capcom, but completely ignore evaluating the game itself for how good of a game it is to begin with on its own merits.At the same time i've seen others compare this game to HellDivers 2, when they can't even be compared as they're not in the same genre of games to begin with (3rd person Shooter, JRPG).On top of that HellDivers 2 has actual battlepass microtransactions that lock actual gear and player progression behind the battlepass which is required and basically mandatory if the player wants to progress and get better geared up in the game as they play, unlike Dragon's Dogma 2 where it doesn't do that and you can get every stupid microtransaction in-game by playing the game, so you're not forced to buy any of them and can completely ignore them.Yet no one seems to be making a complaint about that and clearly people are giving preferential treatment to HellDivers 2 when comparing it to Dragon's Dogma 2.People need to be more rational and reasonable in their judgement and stick to facts/logic instead of bandwagon onto emotions and community rage.I've also written a review for HellDivers 2, which i also own and played, illustrating the obvious battlepass gear progression issue in place.",1
Positive,"First off, the negatives that everyone know so far.The game uses Denuvo. DRMs are bad. DRMs are evil.There are microtransactions that weren't called for.There is no in-game option to restart your save.To which I answer:DRMs are evil. DRMs are bad.The mtx are all optional. None are needed. Not even the riftcrystal. DD2 is no mobile game farming. You can fast travel with in-game items, looted or purchased with gold. You can change your appearance with in-game items, purchased with rift crystals (that can be easily looted off monsters, treasures, and through online pawn sharing). They have no right to exist in a single-player game. But thankfully, their existence don't take away game content. Their existence don't make resources harder to find. These exist for the silly people who love spending more money than they need to.Also, you can reset your save file by using steam cloud's settings and deleting some local files.The goodIt's Dragon's Dogma. The combat is what Dragon's Dogma managed to achieve ten years ago. Reactive, rewarding, satisfying, chaotic. In terms of action-rpg, it is and always will be one of my favorite systems, so of course I'll be biased. The gameplay feels a little more sluggish, but this sacrifice ends up making the movements and interactions feel like they blend together a lot better.Stamina is still consumed outside of combats and unlimited in settlements. Health and damage work nearly the same way, the difference is that, whenever you take direct damage, your maximum health decreases, down to 20%, limiting your amount of recoverable health. This encourages players to do better, to avoid the heal spams, and to simulate grievous wounds that need tending at an inn or at camp. Won't be to the taste of everyone, but I began to dig it.Exploration is slow, can feel tedious, but each journey is rewarding. There is always that sigh of relief when you can finally return to town, unload your loot, stock up on supplies and equipment, then you just go out there once again. Further than last time. Easier than last time. Because your stats increased. Because you became better at mastering the system. It feels good.You want to find sidequests? Listen to NPCs ranting about. Speak to them. Discover rumors. There isn't any marker telling you ""hey you can start a sidequest there"". Some NPCs will come to you. Some will never. Interacting with the world is rewarding.Pawns, the AI-controlled teammates, feel overall smarter, more active and reactive. The personality system has been simplified for everyone's joy, although this takes away the joy of finally having a pawn do whatever the heck you wanted them to do. It will work for some, it won't for others. But to be fair, in DD1 you could just forcefeed scrolls to your pawn until they decided that gathering items and hugging you during big battles is actually a terrible idea.I really enjoy this game. I am so, so very happy to finally see it exist and so grateful I got to play it. So here is my honest tl;dr review:Keep an eye on the game if it's your jam, but do wait for compatibility / performance patches. I may have a somewhat powerful computer, I want more people than those with very good rigs to be able to enjoy it. The game is so very satisfying and so carefully made, with a reputation unfortunately tainted by the terrible, horrendous habits of the modern gaming industry.Please give this game a chance when it gets more accessible.",1
Positive,"Yes, give it a chance. The people complaining about microtransactions are wrong. You can get the currency in game by just playing it, through combat, chests, etc. The only thing that you can spend the currency on are things that don't actually effect gameplay such as hair dyes, redoing your character appearance, pawn appearance, etc. It has no impact and doesn't even incentivize you to purchase the currency. There's nothing scummy about what they've done. That being said, the combat is very fun and addicting. The only thing that I wish they'd done is add a little bit more monsters, as there are currently maybe 25 ? different types of monsters. Maybe 30. It's still extremely fun to try all the classes/vocations out. My only real gripe is the storyline. It's not one of those stories where you actually feel attached to the characters involved. No depth of character for NPCs or the main protagonist. I would rate this game a solid 7.5/10. If you're bored and between games, I would check it out. :)",1
Positive,"As someone who has not made a single microtransaction purchase, played through this game until I accidentally completed it, and am currently on my way through a New Game+ playthrough, I can safely say that most of the knee-jerk reactionary comments about this game are at best wildly over-exaggeration.This game, for the most part, is a wonderful romp through an open fantasy world that doesn't hold your hand or care if you experience everything. The main story can be completed with relative ease, with a majority of the actual content of the game taking place through the myriad side stories and optional dungeons.While the optimization of the game clearly needs work, with myself personally crashing about a dozen times during my playthrough, I can allow that it is the one area of the game that I find utterly unforgivable.I have never had a game do what Dragon's Dogma II has done when I found out where the II had went, and that's all I can say on that safely without spoilers.

Positive,"So, I see a lot of misinformation being spread on reviews here about this game, so I'm hoping to set the record straight.The game has denuvo, this sucks. It also has performance issues. This also sucks.The game has MTX dlcs, but none of them are forced or limitations; AFAIK, every single one of them can be acquired within the game, and with very little effort for most of them. The character redo item is for a very low number of rift crystals, which can also easily be acquired through gameplay, in the very first city. Wakestones are a dime a dozen and the real restriction on them is how much they weigh, which the DLC doesn't even actually help with at all anyway. At worst, it's ""I'm lazy and want to buy these things to give me a headstart"" which, like. to me, that's whatever, man. Standard capcom shit, like the ""unlock everything"" DLCs in DMC and the resident evil remakes.You *can* in fact delete your save and start over. It's annoying to do, but by no means is it impossible.The game itself is *absurdly* fun and well made, and practically everything I wanted from a sequel. The only personal gripe I have aside from the performance issues, which I am hopeful will be patched soon, is that I was hoping for more vocations, like some from Dragon's Dogma Online for instance. but there's always hope for updates or DLC for that!",1
Positive,"Giving a recommendation simply to help the developers. The game is amazing at it's core.The core game is extremely fun and solid. All the 'DLC' is obtainable in game fairly easy except for 1 I'm pretty sure. It's also a single player game, who cares.One save without being able to restart is a dumb decision, but it's being fixed next patch.Performance albeit bad for a lot of people, I haven't experienced any issues myself.The game is good, give it some time to flesh out the kinks and it has the potential to be a long time game.Whilst the negative review bombing was justified in some ways, I don't think the game deserves it.",1
Positive,"Apart from the microtransactions, which I find terrible, I'm probably playing a different game than other people here on Steam. These negative reviews are weird, to say the least. People complaining about the gameplay, what? the gameplay is wonderful. It's one of the best in its genre. People complain about the performance, Capcom fixed that problem, it runs smoothly on my notebook. Before playing a heavy game, trade your potato for a good PC. The game has a good story, excellent gameplay, a huge map to explore, fun side quests, I feel like I'm in a Dungeons and Dragons style RPG. And the best part: I only paid 30 for this wonderful gem.",1

Positive,"This game is mad fun! I've put in 180 plus hours and I'm still in my first play through, 8/10",1
Positive,"The game is great overall, but it has the potential to be even better. First, let me address the negative aspects I encountered. Every time I stepped outside the city, I had to face a lot of monsters. It felt like I had to attack 50 to 100 monsters from city to city, which made it difficult to enjoy the beauty of the world. Additionally, the frame rate issues made the game hard to play and caused frequent crashes. However, the inclusion of pawns is one of the best ideas in any game, and the gameplay is good with a variety of classes to play. I would rate the game 8.3 /10 .",1

Pawn system is amazing and will be hard to not have in future party based RPGS. Yes the story is not a 10 out of 10. But man this is one of the new games in recent memory where I leave town, open my map, place marker far away and enjoy the adventure. Vocations are fun, some less so than others but still fun in their own way. All in all 8 out of 10 for me. I hope the people having stability or performance issues get a fix and enjoy the game like I am.",1
Positive,"My main pawn didn't blush in my presence but she acts giddy and shy when I talk to her in my first playthrough. I will make sure she's blushing at the end of my NG+. I don't care if that would screw the world, it's already screwed nonetheless, so damned you all, I WILL LOVE MY MAIN PAWN",1
Positive,"Despite some quirks, a rough start, and some clearly rushed or unfinished elements, particularly in the story, Dragon's Dogma was an amazing game. Now, despite some quirks, a rough start, and some clearly rushed or unfinished elements, particularly in the story, Dragon's Dogma 2 is an amazing game.-I recently went on a trek with a full party that went sour quickly. I was playing NG+, which is unfortunately way too easy. However, there are a bunch of mods out already, and tools to install and manage them easily, so that was a solved problem. We were going to a far-off place in a dangerous land. My main pawn, my healer, ended up getting thrown into a river somehow during a fight. Dead. We three remaining challenged a medusa, who petrified my borrowed warrior pawn before I could finish hacking off said medusa's head to keep as a weapon. I had petrification cure items but I didn't get to find out if they worked on completely petrified people- he was gone. I think he got smashed to dust during the fight. Dead. I could have retreated to civilization to revive or replace them, but that's no fun. This game is best when you're desperately struggling to make it to your next goal. Instead, me and Arahan, my favorite somebody-else's-pawn, pushed through the desert. Arahan is an archer, and is very sassy, impulsive, and bright. She grabs items all the time and kills everything she sees. She can't pass a wild rabbit without announcing that she's going for a kill shot, and then taking the pelt for a few bucks for me. She's awesome. Also, she's really hot without looking like every other hot pawn girl. Her Arisen is a man of taste.I had already used up most or all of my healing items in a very ill-advised (but fun) solo jump into roughly a dozen goblins. On the way we were ambushed by four consecutive big-ass monsters trying to kill us in terrain that favored them. A lengthy, narrow canyon, full of pounding rain that limited visibility. I had little to no healing left on me, and the mod-empowered monsters forced me to actually play thoughtfully and defensively again, like the early game. I tanked, Arahan spanked. The monsters fell with shattered horns and faces full of arrows. I took loads of dramatic action screenshots to catalog our awesome journey. Another moment saw a party of wolves waiting for us just across a short rope bridge that would definitely break if I went into melee. At my command, Arahan started sniping from our side of the ravine, and then . the wolves all ran off the side of the cliff into the water for no reason and died. (I like the jank, it's usually funny.) We made it to town and I sent Arahan home with a well-deserved heart rating and an item as a gift for her Arisen. I forget what I sent. Something expensive. I'm a good tipper, and she earned it. -There was a strongly negative initial reaction to the inclusion of DLC and some performance problems. It's all nonsense. Gamer bandwagon bs. Damn you, Michael Transactions.The DLC does not matter and if you never clicked ""online store"" on the main menu you would never know it was there. The balance is exactly the same as the first game: it's got a lot of friction, on purpose. If you didn't know that the game limits your travel you might think that it's trying to get you to buy portcrystals. I admit, that is not a good look, and they shouldn't have done it. But it completely does not matter. The game was not balanced to try to get you to buy fast travel points, it just wants you to walk. Also, you never need to use a single rift crystal for anything. You definitely don't need to spend money on affinity items.-People did have some real problems with the game, and it's definitely not 100% finished. There's not much enemy variety, late game gets too easy, NG+ is way too easy, the plot opens more threads than it closes, and the second major area is real sparse on quests. I am an OG Dragon's Dogma sicko so none of the problems surprised or offended me at all. You might not be, and that's okay. I get it. But the game fucking owns. It offers what Dark Souls did that unexpectedly appealed to so many. Not in form, but spirit. Suffer, struggle, and be inconvenienced. It's really fun.",1
Positive,"This game is phenomenal if you learn its mechanics and dont listen to people who dont know the gameplay loop.During the launch of this game the reviews were so negative and i personally wanted to play the game instead of leaving a review at .2 hours complaining about things that are irrelevant like micro transactions and such as that.If you have played Dragon's Dogma Dark Arisen you will like this game its everything DDDA was and better there are some flaws in gameplay like difficulty scaling but gameplay wise its just a the same mechanics but better visually and mechanically.1. Rift crystals can be earned naturally when another player used your pawn you get an amount based on the amount of xp your pawn earned while outside of your own world. i have earned about 24k in just the time i have so far. You can also earn rift crystals in new game plus from normal enemies and chests. ive gotten 300 RC from a chest before.2. Book of metamorphosis. This is a trash item you do not need it. the game itself if you speedrunning it takes about 7 hours to complete and If you have played the 1st DDDA you know that new game plus is the bread and butter of the franchise so in 7 hours you can just create your character again if your unhappy with how your character looks that your own fault dont wast crystals on a book 3. performance in the city. this is the only one i can get the city does lag but it seems to have gotten better with updates i can still walk in the city and only notice a minamal drop.1.The game is very easy, Not saying DDDA was not easy as well this game seems like they really toned down the difficulty almost every class can kill enemies very easily from gryphin to dragons many classes are just op magic archer can ones shot enemies with multiple skills warrior can as well same with almost all classes except for maybe fighter and mage. This lack of difficulty especially endgame is so overwhelming that me personally have resorted to mods to increase enemy health by 4x the normal amount so i can use end game gear and actually have a challenge. 2. New game plus is a joke while DDDA's new game plus wasnt really that big of a deal also this game just makes it feel pointless the game is centered around your first playthough so no meaningfull changes are made on ng+. with the only addition that enemies can drop rift crystals. difficulty is the same as the base playthough except your running endgame gear so the only point is to max out your gear and fully level all vocations. once you have done that the loop of ng+ is just to farm rift crystals and dcp for when a dlc releases. 3. The unmoored world is the endgame area that the games final hours takes place in. Its a phenomenal change of pace, Difficult enemies, some enemies you have never seen before, fighting dragons everywhere. If i could i would stay in this place forever but you cant. its time locked. i remember my first playthrough i had 7 portals open around the world but now i only are getting 3, idk if they changed that with an update or they just nerfed the unmoored world after ng+, ill be honest ive only seen gorechimeras in the unmoored world and the pawn badge asks for 20 of them killed unless there is some secret area i dont know about it insane that you only get these tough and fun enemies at the end and you cant even stay in there. the max i was in the unmoored world was 8 days and if you die you start at the beginning or in 5 day intervals. i wish i could destroy a portal sleep 2 more show up and just continue that loop but no after a while the game just forces you to end the playthrough. unlike DDDA which had entire questlines and entire Sections only for the endgame. in DD2 they give you the ocean which tbh is mostly just empty space. there is gear and cool items there but nothing thats really better then the gear you get with dragon crystals which you get around 300 in the unmoored world.The TLDR version isIf you liked DDDA you will love this game.if your new to the franchise i get it also my buddy started with DD2 cause many told him he didnt need to play DDDA while i agree to a point. alot of the plot points require you to somewhat know the world and alot of the dumb complaints during launch wouldnt be needed if people knew how the orginal game worked.i would say 8/10 since the game does need some improvements but only improvements with scaling the game plays fantastic and i plan on putting way more hours then i already have in this game hopefully getting to max level which if ive heard correctly its 999",1
Positive,"I have left a good review. But i still have some problems with the game.First of all, as so many others have also mentioned, there are problems with optimization for PC and it has not been fixed at the time of this rewive.Secondly, I think things done during the main story have no impact when it comes to the end. I won't go into the specifics because of spoilers. But when I finished the game I thought to myself, what was the point of some of the things I did and found out. When I got nothing out of it other than giving me information, that was not used in the game for anything.The next points are much more up to one's own taste, as my preferences are not unequivocal with others.The game in my eyes does not have the greatest replay value. At least not in the near future, maybe give it 2 years + to play it through again.There are several reasons for this.I have all vocations maxed out, so there is nothing to grind on in that department.To my taste, warfarer is the only vocation to play. It's weaknesses are no maister skills from other vocations and lower stats. Where it instead gives way for you to build how you want to play the game and look yourself. And when you grind high in levels the smaller stats don't mean so much. But that's just me.Emphasis was also placed on less fast travel and a more fun, free way of exploring the world. I also felt that was true, it has been fun to go around and discover the world. But when you have explored the area, you will have to go the same way again from a to b and fight the same mobs and maybe get one of 2 random quests. Either defending an npc from monsters or exporting it to a place somwhat tiring.Those who want to complete all the quests in the game will have problems with the game, as it does not show you where and when there are quests available. Here you have to listen for yourself and be investigative about how people and places you have just arrived or have been to are doing.The main story when you think about it is also pretty short and linear and probably won't take that long if you only go after it again on another playthrough since most people won't delete all their work since you only have one character save.In short, it's a fun and entertaining game with a good number of problems in both optimization, game design and story.74/100",1
Positive,"In light of the fact that this game is currently sitting at mixed reviews as of 2024/03/31, I thought that I should actually attempt a serious review of this game. It will hopefully not be too long.I will address the most common issues touted in negative reviews in order from most valid to least valid. Optimization Bugs MicrotransactionsOptimisation is easily the most valid criticism of this game.My Specs:Win 11 Home13th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-13700KF - 3.40 GHzNvidia Geforce RTX 407032 GB DDR5 RAMRunning game off of SSDPlaying normally I can achieve 60 FPS with all the settings jacked up to max except shadows playing at 1920x1080. I STILL commonly dip below 60, especially in Vermund. This is completely unacceptable, never mind my specs when I'm playing at 1920x1080; 1440p is now considered the norm. I'm running a near top of the line rig, and I can't exceed 60 without massive jumps in my frame rate at 1080p. Unacceptable and perfectly valid complaint. 75% of people don't have the hardware to play this game above medium settings.This complaint is valid, and obviously extremely hard to tackle when everybody has a different experience. One person might not be able to launch the game, others might play through fine with very few bugs. I myself fit into the latter category, and I only had minimal issues through the 120 or so hours I used up enjoying the game. The real issue is that when there WERE bugs, they commonly did break things; I was completely unable to acquire the Spearhand Maister's quest because his quest just refused to fire no matter what I did.Not valid at all, in this case. ALL of the criticisms involving MTX are completely and utterly invalid. Capcom since around 2010 has had timesaving DLC included in the DLC sections of PSN/Xbox Live and now Steam forever. It will never change, and anyone who thought that'd be different here is an idiot. These same types of DLC were present at the original release of Dragon's Dogma. The nature of the DLC is completely benign and harmless, with NONE OF IT being inaccessible in the game. Nothing forces you to pay, and the microtransactions don't affect the game at all. There's one button on the main menu that redirects you to the Steam page; That's the limit of how invasive it is in game. Anybody making an issue of the microtransactions is purposefully and willingly being malicious in order to harm the game. Or stupid.I will break the review down into two parts: Gameplay, Exploration. This is a review from someone who has played the previous game extensively on multiple platforms, and will thus be catered towards such people. I will not be covering the game from the viewpoint of somebody with no experience with the franchise. I'd add a section for pawns, but Steam has given me a character limit.I classify gameplay as the base mechanics surrounding combat, and the outfitting of your characters for such, and in that sense the game is much like the first one with some differences, both good and bad. The base combat loop is much better, with melee combat being the best part of the experience. Melee combat is far more impactful, especially against larger enemies, who are now much more fun to climb now that you can walk around on top of a large enemy as opposed to just clinging to them. There are some issues though.First, the number of slots for skills has been lowered for everybody, and raised by one for Warrior; The lack of slots is not that bad on any of the melee or ranged classes, but magic suffers for it, partly because Sorcerer/Mage have had their skillsets and movesets cut down quite a bit, with much of the functionality of the previous game being ripped out for seemingly no reason. A good example is that you can no longer free aim spells like Maelstrom, you are FORCED to cast it on an enemy, or directly in front of you. Sorcerer/Mage are missing many of the other spells and tools that made them(particularly Sorcerer) great and fun to play in the last game, again, for seemingly little reason.Spells missing:Dark BoonHoly BoonMiasmaIngleLassitudeNecromancyBlearingExequyPetrifactionBrontideGicelFulminationSeriously? Why.? Why cut down over HALF of the original spell list? There's little to no actual choice in the number of spells, now. You are constricted to a small handful of total spells, few of which are actually useful as a Sorcerer/Mage, and it makes the classes feel like garbage a lot of the time, especially considering the utility of the existing spells that are still good have been cut-down as well. This is a martial or a hybrid's game. Do not play Sorcerer or Mage.There are a few new vocations that are Arisen only, and I will say that they are fun with one exception.Mystic Spearhand is supposed to be a replacement for Mystic Knight, but fails in terms of flavor. Gameplay wise, it's a more mediocre martial class with some of the best weapons in the game attached to it, and one stand out ability that can make your party completely invincible for as long as you deign to keep the ability active.Trickster is. different. I will say that it's kind of fun, but it's more a novelty than anything. Play Trickster if you like to watch your pawns play the game for you, cause that is about all that will happen. The class is all about controlling the battlefield, but the caveat to having total control over enemy aggro with the ability to buff your allies is that you literally do no damage. None.Warfarer allows you to take the skills of all vocations excluding maister-skills and use them all in one load-out with a limit of 3 slots(as you need the 4th to change weapons with Warfarer's maister-skill). You can essentially play as a DD:DA Assassin with this kit.One last mention, is that leveling has changed for the better in my opinion: NO MORE MEANINGFUL STAT-GROWTH. NO MORE MIN-MAXING. All vocations buff stats suited to the vocation, and base stats increase based on the vocation you had wihle leveling up, but now all stats cap out at a specific value around level 200. It no longer matters if you min-maxed or didn't; At level 200, everybody is the same besides gear and vocation.There's nothing really new here. You're looking at a world that's quite a bit larger than DD:DA's world, but you essentially do the same thing: Run around, find caves, open chests, kill bandits/goblins/lizards, kill bosses. The one big difference is that unlike DD:DA there are static AND dynamic spawns, seemingly. Many times I've gotten into a fight with a drake while farming only to have a griffin wing down, and then a minotaur show up, and then a horde of goblins turn up, us all fighting and killing one another in one great chaotic brawl, before the griffin takes off with me on it and drags me halfway across the in-game world, only stopping after I'd stabbed it in the head enough to make it come tumbling down in a completely different area then when we had started the fight.Quests are the same. Go here, do that, etc. It is however, far easier to get lost, and quests are harder to find than ever primarily because the NPC count has been increased dramatically. You could spot somebody who was a quest giver rather easily because they'd be forever static depending upon the time of day, and they'd look. expectant somehow. Everybody'd be moving around them, and they'd just be standing there. Now, EVERYONE moves; Quest-givers, meaningless NPCs, everyone. All. The. Time.It's more brief than I'd like, but Steam has a character limit. Hopefully future expansions, updates or DLC can add more to the game.",1
Positive,Love the part where Dogma was Dragon 2,1

Positive,"Valid criticism but excessively overblown controversy aside, Dragon's Dogma II is a wonderful game just like its woefully underappreciated predecessor and if your PC can handle it well enough, I strongly recommend it - and if it can't, I can strongly recommend the somewhat rough but equally brilliant original!Actually, you should play the original as well, regardless.",1
Positive,"Let me start off by saying that I've been waiting for this game for a little over a decade. My expectations for this game were through the roof. Dragon's Dogma 1 is almost the definition of a flawed masterpiece; for every good idea the original had, it also had some weird missteps either brought about by weird design decisions or lack of budget and experience. I watched the GDC talk from the director of Dragon's Dogma 1, Hideaki Itsuno, and he stated that only about 5% of his original vision came through in the final product. Dragon's Dogma 2 is far closer to his original vision, to the point where the games barely resemble each other.That's all to say that my expectations for Dragon's Dogma 2 have been met and then some. From the small details like your pawns mentioning how their player has a party of all women to the large details like the huge map, this game is always impressing me in one way or another. There are few downsides, but one of them is NOT the microtransactions. The microtransactions are typical Capcom ""we gotta tack on microtransactions that don't really affect the game balance to appease the stockholders"" microtransactions. All of the items you can buy for real money are easily earnable in-game, so buying them with real money only serves as a tiny shortcut. The most impactful is the port crystal, but without ferrystones that purchase is pretty worthless. People started shitting themselves that Capcom ""snuck in microtransactions"" without actually examining them. The outcry got so bad that my sister's boyfriend, who barely knew of the game's existence, had heard that Capcom had removed features and mechanics and hid them behind microtransactions; something super villainous, yes, but also completely fabricated by people who want to see this game burn strictly because these completely worthless microtransactions were added after the game's launch. The real problem with the game lies in its performance. I have a midrange PC and it unfortunately struggles to run this game. This game is very CPU heavy and I had to limit my framerate to 30 to avoid massive jumps in the framerate from in-town to outside. As a guy who played the original at nearly 15FPS on PS3, I can say that this is indeed an improvement, but I can totally understand why someone wouldn't want to play this game because they can't get a stable 60FPS out of it. Overall, I love this game. I would recommend it to anyone who loves RPGs like I do",1
Positive,"Hey, this is a review for those worried about the microtransactions and are unsure if the mixed reviews are fair.The TLDR of it: You've really nothing to worry about. The microtransactions aren't mandatory, nor did I buy a single one. You get ""RC"", an in game currency, just by playing the game. I would not advise buying anything either, because it is just not needed and gives no value to the actual game. The game itself? Is amazing. The story is great, the combat is amazing and there is a game after the game. You will understand when you get there. :)The long of it:I have loved the franchise ever since DD1 and its expansion Dark Arisen. If you are the same, you will love DD2 with all your heart and soul. It remained true to everything the franchise stands for. A complex, sometimes confusing story that you can figure out the more you investigate, mystery at every corner, every fight worth taking no matter how big or small you may be, a unique way of being able to interact with the community through your companion (Pawn) and some of the best combat ever known to exist in games.Even without purchasing any microtransactions I was able to play the game, as one would, in DD1/DA. I felt no difference at all. In fact, I liked the game all the more for it. My Pawn, Zyk, comes back to me near every day with around 500-1000 RC which never even makes it a worry for me to not have enough of the currency to customize as I please. You have enough in game vendors, where you just use gold, to get everything you could possibly get in the dumb store, except it will feel so much better to get it through gameplay than you would through a purchase. Many times you won't even be driven to the temptation as you tend to accrue an abundance thereof just from playing. If you are the explorer sort that really goes through every nook and cranny of the games you play, you'll have so much of all of those things you even start giving them away to others as Pawn rewards.The story itself is one that you will like or hate. My bias is, I love it. The esoteric mystery behind it just hits my vibe in every perfect way, and if you read between the lines or investigate further on it, you start to understand more and more of it too. There are certain things that are left unanswered, to those that expect every small detail in a backstory of key characters, but they are not required to understand the overall premise of what Dragon's Dogma is all about.Exploration is highly rewarded in this game. Everywhere you go is rewarding in its own regard. Every person you help as well, should you fail or not. Yes, prepare to fail on a few quests in your first run through, or not achieve the optimal end of them but you need not worry, there's always another time, and then you will know what to do if not even be well prepared in advance.The crafting isn't anything too special. Similar to Elden Ring just you do not require cook books and discovery recipes yourself by merging item A with item B. Each item is useful though and with special training you can give your Pawn, they can start using said items on you too. Pro Tip: if you get 0 HP you can still open your inventory and use healing items before you succumb. :)Vocations are all unique in their own regard, and later on you will get access to more powerful, hybrid version. But if you like being a fighter from start to finish, you will find you will easily be able to compete with the elite vocations too. So do not fret on having to be forced to e one specific class. For those of you that get their rocks off on making a class of your own, you will love the Warfarer, however it is unlocked a bit later in the game.Yes, you can romance. Go do your pixel dating sim ;). Even opens up a few quests or boons depending on who you woo. Imagine that!Cons, yes there always are some:- Microtransactions: Seriously Capcom? Shove it up yours.- One Save File: Seriously one of the most stupid decisions. Just let me have multiple saves man. - Pawn AI can be sometimes jank, but in turn it can lead to funny situations like looking over the side of a cliff face to see if you can drop down safely, just to see a pawn yolo it next to you and splat in the ground. Oh, and they like drowning a lot too.- Let me date my Pawn QQ (Kidding. sort of. maybe. leave me alone!)!WARNING SPOILERS AHEAD WARNING!CON SPOILERS / DO NOT READ IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO BE SPOILED:- Dragon's Plague: It's too brutal and harsh on those that do not understand the system, which isn't done intuitively either.- Materials only available at True End endgame: Would have been better if you had one or two locations post End Game timed map to get such materials, for those who are in NG+ to get them again. Sometimes it is just cool to feel like you are in the world you saved and not need to go back into the True End.!WARNING SPOILERS END HERE WARNING!Overall, it is definitely worth it. The Price Tag is hefty, yes. I'd still buy it again no less. For those of you unsure though, wait for sale. I promise you won't regret it if you are an avid fan of the Dark Souls series or Monster Hunter.",1
Positive,"I 1000% can understand the negative reviews in regards to performance but I'm noticing a few things with DD2 and certain peoples configurations.I have seen 3000/4000 series have issues - However, I am posing no issues FPS wise, even ran it with RT on accident (Besides FPS drops to 40-55 in capital, which I agree needs to be optimized; right now DLSS is definitely posing issues for Nvidia users: For awareness, you can manually update the DLSS version, so far I have not been banned (however, I have resorted to not using it in fear of getting banned especially with silly Denuvo (Which is ABSOLUTELY hindering performance over NUMEROUS systems)I see mostly 5xxx Ryzen users mainly report crashes, and issues running the game, while I see some Ryzen Nvidia users run the game somewhat over bearable but lowering / improving shader cache in Control Panel + High affinity works.However I'm on a 3900x, 3070. I do have 64GBs of RAM and will happily even tier down to 32GB to test performance but RAM use of this game is a little on the needy side, but 16GB is still fine. My friend has a 5000 series GPU and an AMD gpu comparable to my 3070, sometimes even outright outperforming me. I will however say: I have a mismatched RAM pairing from brands, 2666 mhz and 3000, overclocked to 3000, with my all cores to 4.3, my game HAS not crashed once, with or without clocks, but certain updates/fixes such as DLSS and the shader cache has raised my FPS significantly: Denuvo + Poor CPU optimization is what is at play here. The rest of the game however is incredible, I loved Dogma 1, I played it mainly on console but will sink more hours into it after I've had my fun with 2, monster variety is comparable to base game, not Dark Arisen + DLC monsters, and the combat is way more gritty. Greatsword combo'd with Sorcerers is such a fun combo, stamina and learning movesets through each monster is actually fun but can become relatively easy if you like to min/max - story telling is partially the focus and is a redesign of 1 in an alternate universe/timeline, but I appreciate this approach as it adds a lot of depthDD1 was wildly incomplete in some areas and had smaller but equally as frustrating issues on release but were promptly fixed, it has the unique charm DD1 brings and is a very niche RPG, but even if the RPG side of it doesn't interest you, just have fun with the general hunt and fights against monsters - When I'm bored I just intentionally aggro as many as I find at night, try it sometime.I understand the MTX concern however same were done for DMC5, MHW even in terms of redeemables, nothing new there. Game's absolutely gorgeous and plays nice, controller will definitely feel better however greatsword is crazy fun on kbm once you get timings, since your sword has so much reach will hit something anyway ;)Is it worth the price right now for performance? I don't know I just got a 1.65GB patch, I'll be sure to update this if it's improved anything for anyone I know and myself. If you're still on the fence and have mid-range hardware, wait a little bit. I know 2 hours refund window is not a lot - Game has a lot of scale if you get lost and explore like I do. But it's there, so if you feel uncertain now, wait for a sale or more patches!EDIT:Performance is not much different; DLSS looks to be 50/50. We need more dynamic events for the world, the encounters are enough to where it's just like 1, but people would have already experienced 1's extra monsters, monster archetypes etc and would expect something of that scale but in base game while dlc would expand it much more but it's alright, I know once patches come + go and if the DLC is big and adds or fixes a lot of QoL, I wouldn't mind just smaller updates that adds better encounters/dynamic quests. I'm not usually an optimist but I hope Itsuno will work on putting more of his vision in the game, I fear a lot of things were or maybe put back to the drawing board AGAIN just like DD1, because ""too ambitious"" from execs.People should slap hardware specs in the comments on this feedback. Does anyone have basically an identical system to mine? It really is also Denuvo ruining performance for people but I only have issues in Capital and I'm running everything on max almost - without dlss so",1
Positive,"An overall improvement to Dragon's Dogma. In the first game Pawns felt like little more than extra bulk to the party. In DD2, pawns have their own personalities and skills on top of what their vocation offers. It is so nice to have automated inventory management and crafting because it allows me to focus on the fun parts of the game. It's also really cool that pawns will lead you to caves and treasure chests they've found in other worlds, and will lead you to quest objectives or NPCs. I don't recall that being in the first game, if it was at all. Then there's the density of content in DD2. I remember putting off returning to DD1 because I was going to have to walk across the map to get to a destination. I had the infinite fast travel item, but the problem was how boring it was going to be getting near the destination, and then the ammount of enemies I would have to fight to finally reach the destination. DD2 solves this problem really well with the camping system. I no longer have to worry about how long a trip is going to be because there will always be a campfire nearby where I can heal and rebuff. I have the freedom to explore and fight monsters because I know that If my health gets low enough, I can just rest and continue on the jouney the next day. So why recommend in light of the controversy surrounding the game?I laugh everytime someone brings up DD2's micro-transactions. I can confidently say these were put in place by publisher and not dev team. Everything inside the game is crafted with purpose. Every item and every system serves a purpose and serves it well. The micro-transactions go against this design philosophy in such an outrageous way, I am honestly a bit confused why people are targeting DD2 itself instead of speaking out against CAPCOM. I get that it is one of the only ways to express distaste to the publisher, but the game itself doesn't deserve mixed reviews.Well what about the optimization?This is the strongest argument for a not recommended rating on the game, but I have a few remarks for my experience. For me, the game is better optimized than Elden Ring was on launch. I have a 2060, so I'm playing on lowest settings, but the game still looks nice. Yes there is a lot of choppiness in town but it is still playable, and I have had 1-2 crashes after a game save so nothing game breaking. I believe the games design and content outshine the graphical problems it has currently, and like Elden Ring, I expect optimization patches will resolve the issues we have on release.",1
Positive,"A bit biased because dd1 was one of my favorite games BUT to me this is the best RPG-like game i've played, they took everything from the first game and improved upon it and added new mechanics and such that makes the game better and more immersive. The combat feels so good and responsive, even better when you get into the flow of it, things feel meaty / weighty, they added physics to the monsters so they'll trip on big steps off edges or ragdoll with strong enough hits, shits great. THE BAD being for me rn is the performance, they haven't fixed it as of writing this review, they're working on it, but for me personally its only an issue in bigger cities, the capital being the worst and some of the larger villages being so-so. It is VERY noticeable in the cities, not so much out in the wilds, tho some areas can get a bit choppy. Is it unplayable? No, not by anymeans. Is it in a state that isn't very acceptable for the standard of AAA gaming? Yes, 100%. As is right now with the performance issues for me i'd give it a 7.5ish/10. The MTX stuff is kinda eh, but in reality its nothing that you even have to interact with at all in the game, you get all that stuff in PLENTY in game. I don't agree with MTX bs being shoved into games, but again its optional, not needed. The save stuff as of writing review is kinda fucked, but again in my experience, I haven't tried to restart or care to so its not an issue for me but i could see how that would bother or upset some people. Overall this games getting a bit of a bum wrap for issues that aren't that big of a deal in my personal opinion, if you're on the fence about it i would for sure give it a shot when its on sale! But overall this game is a VERY solid rpg and for me personally the best I've ever played. Thank you for reading my Ted Talk.",1
Positive,"DESPITE the micro-transactions and if u have a fairly decent computer, the game is actually incredibly fun. In my opinion, just ignore the small payments, they really don't change the gameplay. No this isn't me saying that what Capcom did is a good thing, i am against it but the game is really fun. I do agree that they should drastically improve the PC version of the game with both the optimisation and the movements (it feels like its forcing you to play with a controller but your actually playing with a keyboard and mouse). Overall this shit can be ignored easily, its a single player story game, not an online competitive e-sport type of game. I'm enjoying it a lot, although I'm still looking for the romance options which i saw on Youtube.",1
Positive,"Mixed reviews are from COD dopamine juicers who either - 1. can't read and are pissed about the useless and stupid in game store (to be fair it's fucking stupid and you can get everything offered in game easy) or 2. Dopamine crack babys got sucked into the hype and want out.The game is awesome. There are so many encounters and random events that have happened to me naturally. Ogre bridges. Lucky griffin fall catches. A pawn named Dumbledoor waiting to receive a high five after chucking a fucking harpie off the cliff with his bare hands. The story is keeping me hooked as well.There is some Jank. some of the background npcs will disappear in front of you some times. the faces are great at some points, weird uncanny valley vibes .2% of the time. There are sneaky style quests and no immersive sneaky walk:( Most of the initial cut scene time was to explain how they dont have a fucking swim mechanic. ""It seems I'm being eaten by water tentacles like in the first game master, WaTeR BaD!"" or something. if you are on the fence about the game I recommend NOT buying it. It. is. expensive. and a $70 price tag comes with expectations of mind blowing game play from AAA teams. I believe the 29 hours I have played so far is worth the price point for myself.To any dev reading this give me something cool in-game I know you can do it.",1
Positive,"Much like the first, its just a brilliant game. Combat is fun, exploration is fun. Sure there being limited fast travel at times is annoying. In saying that you are able to find stones that you can put down and then fast travel to it. Again much like the first game. As for the micro transactions that have driven people away. Everything that is offered through that you can just obtain ingame. You never have to go out of your way to find them/craft them. In the 18 hours I have played I would not have known they were in had it not been for people crying about it and making false claims. The fps issues people have gotten have thankfully not found their way to me. However a new release having said issues is unacceptable. Like with most games I am very sure it will be sorted soon. I couldnt recommend this game more. If you want to try a game like this get the first one and make your decision from there. Its significantly cheaper. The story is fantastic and landscape has just as much effort put into it.Buy both, both good :)",1
Positive,"I like it. Pretty Dope so far.Things people have been saying. None of which have made me personally want to see the Grippy Sock Doc:- I haven't bought anything other than the game. MTX seems like its here to stay, I just don't pay. Easy-lemon sneezy- Runs fine for me- Don't care about Denuvo- Googled how to start a new game and it was easy so ehStuff I like so far:- Pawns are way more interactive with each other and the player than the first game, though sometimes dudes need to shut up- Combat feels satisfying, though I wish I could dodge with every class- Character designs are pretty neat- I like that they made the story less confusing than the first one, but still confusing enough to have to figure it out- Cities and towns definitely feel way more alive in this- Recipe tab for combining was a nice touch- The cooking animationThings I don't like so far:- Travel in general can be inconvenient for a Dad and Military member with only a few hours a day to play- I had to do a short quest to unlock Sorcerer and Warrior, got over it quickly though- Haven't gotten to unlock my favorite class yet. probably because I restarted- Feels like certain attack animations can't be cancelled after a certain point which has led to a lot of ouchies- Had to be a member to go to the brothel- Not every class has a stealth mechanic, but there are a lot of stealth missions, at least at the start- Townsfolk REALLY hate when you fight guards (this one is more of a warning)Leaving comments on because the military has taught that low morale brings people together.or drives them to drink.Edit: Cause I forgot to TURN ON Comments. heh",1
Positive,"when they said martyr's bolt would ""temporarily"" decrease max health, i didn't plan my own suicide at the hands of mere goblins - that hp is NOT recoverable w/o restotherwise! fun game! would also be great if i could set waypoints/villages for my pawns to guide me to them instead of constantly checking maps and taking long routes. flamefang arrow is absolutely hilarious for nuking unsuspecting prey, too. watched a troll get nailed in the head while hanging from a tree and the brother bellyflopped and got stunlocked for the rest of the fight, all in good fun",1
Positive,"thank the gods i created my characters in the creator tool before hand or i would have had 6 Hours more :3Review:it's Dragon's Dogma 1 just better and more (except for equipment which has no clothing anymore)but it's a well and good game and i will recommend it on the basis that the game is for fans of the first oneand the ones complaining about micro-transactions i just would like to remind about other Capcom games that gotten them and they are not necessary at all it's for people that got more money then time nothing more (Devil may Cry 5, Resident Evil 4 Remake and some others)is it ok to make some items into Micro-transactions? nope it's not but the overall game is good and all of these can be gotten ingame without issue i for one never spend any money on the Rift currency and have more than enoughso yeah i say grab it if you love the first game or you love to experience a immersive adventureand if the price is too steep just wait for a sale",1
Positive,"Yea I mean the microtransactions are not really a problem, I just think the way that capcom did this is still very shady. They could have prevented this by being transparent and telling people that ""hey, we are going to add some microtransactions but since they are not super-beneficial, you can be just fine not purchasing them"", but then they would have gotten very few sales.So what do they decide to do instead? They drop it on launch without any mentions beforehard, which causes people to freak out about it because most people have not yet had a chance to play the game, so they make the assumption that these items will give you a significant edge.The same people that decided to buy these microtransactions probably thought the very same thing, that they were getting ahead of the curve. So you could make the argument that capcom was capitalizing on impulse buyers that do not care if a game is P2W or not (not saying that dragons dogma is).That is why I think it was still a bit shady of them, but we do not know what goes on behind the scenes and what really caused them to do this. I just think that they did a mistake releasing these microtransactions, because the game is good on its own and did not need this, even if the DLCs are easy to aquire.",1
Positive,"A flawed but very fun game that allows you to explore a large world (without loading screens) and build up your character and pawn companion.The story gets in the way of that sometimes because you need to do it to progress through the game. It's not well put together and seems to be missing parts, so it ends up being incoherent at times. The side quests were a lot better but they sometimes ended abruptly or lacked alternative solutions to complete them.The vocations offer different options to change your gameplay and prevent it from being boring but you can only equip 4 skills at once. The new Trickster vocation is pretty useless because it relies on the AI to do the combat for you.I think Dark Arisen was more challenging at the beginning whereas DD2 feels easy all the way through, but the presentation of the game makes combat exciting. The game could have benefited from more unique enemy types and boss encounters though.I put a lot of hours into the game and still wanted more out of it by the end. I feel that the endgame could have had more content, since more gear was unlocked but there were no new challenges that required better gear.Maybe the game will feel more complete with the DLC.",1
Positive,"The first CRPG I played that held me spellbound with a sense of wonder for its immersive world was Might and Magic VI. And then again with Elder Scrolls: Oblivion. And now, Dragon's Dogma 2.Journeying with a party has never felt more intimate. You literally trek for in-game days through such beautiful vistas, hear your party members' banter, feel a sense of their personalities and get into some epic encounters.I realized that the last game that gave me a vast untamed world was Red Dead Redemption 2. And now the lands of Vermund may have gripped me so. Hearing the crackle of the fire, wind through the trees, the silhouette of a ruins in the background, incredible.And the fights are so epic at times. The pawns are so incredibly intelligent now, they'll position correctly, their personalities will make them dive headlong into fights or stand back strategically. They'll cover for you, provide heals, etc. The game builds such a sense of trust with your party members, that you truly feel like an adventurers' party.I waited 12 years for this game. If you play Skyrim modded, that is merely a fraction of Dragon's Dogma 2's power, right out of the box.EDIT: I'm writing this after 44 hours with the game, and yeah it's GOTY for me.",1
Positive,"played the first one, loved it. quite enjoy this one and i only have 2 issues with it so far. the world LOOKS big. but so far its just paths. its not a big ol open area like the first one. mayhaps i just havent gotten to the nice big open area since im not that far in. but why make me travel so far if its just walk along set path and kill EVERYTHING along the way. also running city to city is giving me a ulcer. i traveled by ox and got combed by a troll(i forget) then a griffin drops in and destroyed the cart. ended up running to the town since it KEPT happening (i kept dying) and i kept either running into too strong of a monster or got ganged up on by a buncha small ones while along cuz my pawns all died from the griffin. the first game made it clear u should just run from a fight u cant take. these damn enemies keep following me wayyyy too long and i guess im just stupid but damn, what happened to retreating from fights i cant take?i dont mind the micro transactions since uh, those items are all in the game. dont wanna pay, then farm up some cash or RC and just buy it normally. Having to commit to choices i made (my ugly character and pawns horrid voice) isnt bothering me, idk i guess im used to old games where u just committed to decisions you made and got used to it. Also its running surprisingly well considering i have a 6500 4gb. i have it in the lowest settings i can stand and its mainly choppy for the first half hour or so then finally plays fine. i just leave it running, paused and go do something else. the rest of my pc isnt as trash tho, prob why its running well enough.",1

Positive,"Resident Evil MTX:DMC MTX:Monster Hunter MTX:Dragon's Dogma 1 MTX:Dragon's Dogma 2 MTX: >:o!?!?!this is what Capcom has done for over ten years, get a grip lol",1
Positive,"My experience with Dragons Dogma 2 was a roller coaster ride from start to finish.- 1st I'll start with the bad experiences. First and foremost I had an issue early in my first 20 hours being Dragons Plague. It was on the first weekend of release and little was known at the time of how it worked. It killed about 75% of the population of Vernworth and I didn't know they would respawn or that there was an item to eventually fix the problem of dead npcs so I ended up deleting my save and restarting which was a massive bummer. -2nd The second issue I had was some of the quest design felt dated. It certainly reminded me of the original DD (I played a lot more on the console then pc) so that was good but it also felt like they were plenty of things that could go wrong with the quest if you missed even a single clue or maybe an npc wasn't where it was suppose to be or something was done in the wrong order. It just felt like there was a lot of ways for quest to go wrong. For some people that may be what they want, something that really makes you take your time and plan the quest out, but for someone like me, I just wish there was a little more to push you in the right direction. -3rd Third and final problem is some optimization issues and some features missing from the game. A lot of people had issues with frame-rate drops or just getting it to even run for more than 10 minutes, I had none of these issues. The only issues I had were frame drops in cities from time to time and the occasional crash. It was rare that it happened but it never really took me out of the experience of the game. (Im running this on a 3070 btw). As for the features, why the hell isn't there a new game feature. I feel like this was a huge oversight. Such a silly thing to not put into a game even if you are running the premise of only wanting players to have one save. - Now for the good things. The combat, oh the combat. I missed this type of combat. You have that monster hunt type of movement on monsters and abilities while also keeping that old DD feel of throwing and manipulating the environment or even controlling beast. Felt just as good as the original and happy too see it still feels amazing. - The story, now for some this could be a confusing one, I felt a little confused at some plot points. (I won't get into them due to spoilers) but the general questline from the start to end just felt a little odd. Like from Vernworth to The beastren capital onward. It felt like Vernworth was just poorly connected near the end. Maybe I missed something but idk. Felt like they were going for a Game of Thrones type of situation and stumbled somewhere in the middle of it. However near the end, once you forget about that, I enjoyed it. The ending I got, if I wasn't so persistent on figuring out why a certain item was relevant, I never would have gotten that amazing ending. Im writing this review right after I finished the game and I have much more I would like to say, but I'll cut it here and just say this. - I enjoyed this game. Faults and all. It needs a little more work with the optimization and all but otherwise. If you are seeing the combat and the pawn interactions and thinking this game looks interesting. Grab it, I recommend it. There is much to do in this game and the combat can take you a long way as far as enjoyment goes. I gave it a poor review after my initial incident, but I've turned to loving it and this is a game I'll be coming back to from time to time just to enjoy the combat, the scenery and to enjoy more adventures with my pawn. Thank you for reading this mess of a review and have a good one.",1
Positive,"Dogma don't miss my friend. However I agree with some of the downvotes, if they keep to their word and fix what needs to be fixed, I honestly see no reason for a mixed review. But I guess we will see. An hour in and the combat and story is great so far. And graphics, god so good.EDIT ~DAYUM, other than performance. This some good stuff.",1
Positive,"I love the combat and exploration in this game. It's nothing but fun and it feels good taking out these huge enemies. The companion system is well polished and I love the freedom this game gives me to do whatever I do. I see a lot of people that have issues with the framerate but it's not that big of an issue for me, I get around 50-70 fps and going into cities it does drop to around 30 fps but it's still playable for me. Hopefully a patch will come out to help the issue but other than that I haven't ran into any glitches and bugs yet.",1
Positive,"Seeing the reviews for this game legitimately makes me sad.I've been a hardcore gamer now for over 20 years, I've seen all manner of awful, lazy titles. Uninspired gameplay, heavy microtransactions, and devs who do not care.It is sad to see that this game, which evidently has had such passion put into it by its developers, be absolutely shit on for the slightest of things.Don't get me wrong, the issues people have regarding no new characters, and performance issues are well founded, even though these are evidently already being addressed by the devs.But to absolutely demolish a game on launch, for so called ""microtransactions"", is ridiculous. Yes, microtransactions in a singleplayer experience seems very strange and alarming, but these are for items and conveniences that are so readily and easily available in game, but of course everyone jumped on the bandwagon and thought these were exclusives.This is why you should always take reviews with a pinch of salt. Buy the game, play for 2 hours, and make your own decision. Gamers these days are babies, and don't realise how good their eating with this release.",1

Positive,"If you enjoyed the first game, then you'll love this one. They have taken everything we loved in the first game and improved it.
