Positive,Dark Souls is one of the best series ever made and this game is easily 10/10 for me. Loved every single thing about it. Praise the Sun! and praise the Fire Keeper,1
Positive,"a masterpiece. If you play the game you will understand why I call it a masterpiece. It's impossible to explain with words. You can only know by feeling it. You can only know by playing and being consumed by the dark souls universe. You will ultimately become a better person the second you launch this game. I suffer from an addiction called league of legends. I was a terrible person when I played that trash game. It gave me major depression from being hardstuck gold 3 19LP. Dark Souls has changed my life for the better. It has made me better at communicating with women and ever since I launched the game nothing has come to me but pure joy and happiness. I have gotten married to the woman of my dreams. I have also started a family and I am going to get my daughter into dark souls once she is old enough. I will never let this game die as long as I live. Dark Souls is truly an amazing experience that you do not want to miss out on. It will bring you so much joy and fortune. I have never been happier, and I haven't played league in a very long time now. I dont even have the urge or temptation to even install the game. I think that if smokers played dark souls they would forget about smoking. They wouldn't even want to take time out of their day to smoke when they can just play dark souls 3",1
Positive,"DS3 is Truly amazing, I love the music, gameplay , graphics & boss fights.The game is difficult and takes time to learn but at the end is very rewarding I would highly recommend buying 10/10 masterpiece.",1

Positive,"I played this game when i was 16 years old, it was my very first Souls game and provided me with so many amazing times. I was heavily depressed at the time but this game became my home and reminded me to never give up no matter how dark things get. Here i am nearing my 26th birthday and having played all souls games, this is the one that will always be special for me, i write this as i'm reinstalling it, if you are doubting if this game is worth your money.this is your answer. Thank you and praise the sun",1

Positive,"I don't usually write reviews because most people couldn't even bother to read them. Despite this, I would say that this is an amazing game that is surprisingly dead for how good it is!Dark Souls III was my introduction into the souls universe and it was truly an amazing experience.People always say Dark souls is difficult, Dark Souls is hard. But it really isn't. It's challenging. It requires your attention. Masterful architecture, stunning graphics, wonderful level design, full of shorcuts and the fights. The tactical side behind each fight leaves so spoiled that every other game fighting mechanic seems rather simplistic and boring in comparison.Bosses are fantastic for the most part. Every bosses were unique and well designed. TBH the bosses are so good that you feel honored to be killed by them. Each boss has a personality and backstory that makes fighting them either extremely exciting or super sad. One of the most beautiful things about Dark Souls III is the music. The music is simply stunning!10/10 for me",1
Positive,"Best game I ever played my whole life. The entire experience of playing this game is outstanding.

Positive,if you dont like dark souls you will like this game,1
Positive,I played this after finishing Elden Ring and if you loved Elden Ring then it's very likely that you'll love Dark Souls 3 too. The cycle of death and perseverance makes the eventual successes you achieve all the more sweeter.,1
Positive,"Seriously, one of the best games i've ever played in my life.I've never been a fan of RPGs myself, always went for FPS games. But i got an interest for this game, for it was known for it's ""diffculty"" (more onto that later), the bosses, the sceneries, etc.I was gifted this game, and i have to say, it was one of the best gifts i've ever received.About the game itself, if you are scared to pick it up, don't. The game is not as hard as people make it out to be, it just leaves you to discover stuff for yourself, to learn the mechanics, playstyles, etc.This game is by far the best for beginners to the DARK SOULS franchise, for it has the most polished gameplay out of the three, with some more simpler mechanics.kinda of. Parries are definetely something that actually requires a bit of skill, and the same goes for backstabs, to a certain extent. You have to be more precise with stab than in previous games, but we're getting offtrack. The story is good, nothing really amazing, but the main focus of the story is good. The lore of the rest of the kingdom of Lothric (and the DLC worlds too) are what's interesting about DARK SOULS games. The lore of every boss, every area, every enemy, it's all really fascinating and well crafted, just like in other games, so it doesn't disappoint in that regard.Gameplay in itself i found pretty satisfying, but i do think the PVP part of the game could have some problems fixed (Hackers, Griefers, etc)Soundtrack in the game is also pretty awesome. There is something in particular about the Final Boss' theme that has made a lot of people really emotional (myself included). It's a really cool easter egg, but i won't spoil anything. This game's music is something you have to experience yourself to understand how awesome and well produced it is.The game in itself is beautiful. It has stunning graphics and is extremely well optimized (except for the beggining of the Ringed City DLC, all the ash may eat up your frames). All the effects, boss fights, sceneries and enemies have an immense amount of care put into them, to make them feel like they belong in this fantasy world, and to look the best they possibly can. In short, DARK SOULS 3 is an amazing game, not too far from a masterpiece in my opinion. Shame that it still has some things that should've been improved by this time, but whatever, the game is still playable. I highly recommend giving this game a try. Seriously, it's amazing.",1
Positive,good game ahead,1
Positive,"A lovely game only The Great Miyazaki could create. The aspects of Dark Souls, the series as a whole, are irrefutably unique and addictive. DS3 did a great job bringing back to the rolling i-frames of DS1 with much smoother game play, it felt completely natural. 9/10.",1
Positive,yeah this game? this game good. best game? probably. pretty good yeaaaaaah. get game. get claymore. get gud. fun game. get 100%. no more game? get sad. play game for 20th time? is very nice. Truly a Classic,1

Positive,Easily one of the most replayable games ive ever played,1
Positive,"My first souls game. I was one of those people who said the game wasn't for me. Now, after 34 hours full of rage and dying, I can say that it's one of the best game I've ever played. Praise the sun !",1
Positive,"Atmosphere is fantastic, the armour designs are kickass, the combat is faster and more refined than the previous games in my opinonvery fun, definitely recommend",1
Positive,"**RECOMMENDED AT ANY PRICE.****YOU WILL WANT TO HAVE A CONTROLLER.**one of the best, most compelling games i have ever played.ignore the hype, this game is not as difficult as you've heard, what it is is *extremely unforgiving* with almost no margin for error.it has a steep learning curve and treating this like a standard hackey slashey will get you killed very quickly, and those deaths may cause ragequits - but the game is never actually *unfair*.it is merely extremely unforgiving.you'll get better and as you get better, the game will get easier, because you've become so much better at it.and other games will feel lesser.",1
Positive,This game re-defines peoples taste on video games. Loved it. Will continue loving it.,1
Positive,I would recommend it,1
Positive,"I highly recommend this game, but understand that it isn't for everyone. Once you pass the learning curve it becomes a very enjoyable experience because of the feeling you get from overcoming a challenge.Ignore all the stupid kids yelling ""git gud"" whenever you ask for help. While ""getting good"" is definitely the primary way to pass a hard area, the game is amazingly designed so that you can always overcome the challenge somehow; whether it's by grinding, trying something else, leveling up, or asking a white phantom (a friend) for help.Don't be scarred away by the difficultly, just rise to the challenge.",1
Positive,its fun if you hate yourself,1
Positive,this game is amazing and for only 12bucks on humble bundle get it now!,1
Positive,"If you face crippling depression and anxiety and you want to further the amount you want to kill yourself, this is truly the game you have been looking for.",1
Positive,"Never thought that I would play souls game. This was my 4th attempt playing this game I think. But finally I managed to beat it! Oh God it feels so good. I was so addicted to beating the bosses. I didn't care about deaths anymore, I just wanted to beat the game! What a great experience 10/10!",1
Positive,"-The gameplay is amazingly fluid and precise.-There is verry little input lag, even if you play with mouse and keyboard.-You are able to roll diagonally towards or away from your enemies when the camera is locked onto them, instead of only letting you roll straight towards or away from them.-As to be expected by a Souls game, you have to keep an eye on your stamina bar. You cannot just reclessly keep hitting or rolling, forcing you to think wether or not you play more risky or rather safe.-Items have not only resistance/attack atributes, but also weight, so, like in other Souls games, having heavier armor may reduce the damage you take by enemy hits, but also slows your moving speed and your rolls down. The player must choose carefully what armor/weapons/rings they wear.-The soundtrack is atmospheric and the sound design in general is pleasing.-Although some soundtracks are less powerfull, they still all fit the setting and are verry high quality music with many nunances and details.-Like the other two Dark Souls games the music isnt present everywhere, giving you silence to hear the quiete background sounds of the levels and to think about where you are on your journey and what is happening. Simultaniously, because the music isnt there for the most time of playing, it makes the music all the more powerfull and impressing when it does kick in, while entering a place of great signinficance or a boss arena.-It is capped at 60 fps, but it should run on most pcs always at that framerate and it is good enough for a 3rd person role play game, wich doesnt have fast camera movements for the most part.-I havent encountered many bugs. Rarelly the game crashes, maybe a couple times a year. There are some glitches here and there, but i havent seen gamebreaking bugs so far.-The graphics might not be the best looking out there, but they are cohesive and form a nice looking world.-Shadows and lighting effects look nice and most surfaces and especially character models have sharp and detailed textures.-There are quite many settings to adjust, but antialising doesnt have high settings, so there is always some amount of jagged edges if you pay close attention.-The level design is verry well made. Many people dislike it because not all levels are completelly interconnected in a tight area like they are in Dark Souls, but it offers a wide variety of locations, in a continous world with next to none loading screens. Also you can see many parts of the world in the distance, meaning you can walk through an entire area, look back and see the places you have been, or you can look forwards beyond the edges of your current area and see parts of the places where you will later go. You may not have the same freedom as you do have in Dark Souls to go in one of many different directions from the beginning, but you still can choose to some degree in wich order to play through the areas and you can even choose to go early in late game areas. if you are a masochist or a professional speed runner, much like in Dark Souls.-Each location offers not only different types of enemies, but also different types of environmental hazards and its own setting with its own kind of beauty.-There is a plethora of different items to discover. Sure there are some items that are ""useless"" and many items you wont need for your playstyle, but there is freedom of leveling up your character and choosing the equipment that best suits your own way of playing the game. Generally speaking there is some usage for almost all of the items in the game.-Each fight is challenging and requires the player to think and make propper use of their weapons and equipment.-Combat is methodical. Every type of enemy has their own moveset and the player must understand each type of enemy and adapt their playstyle to them or use the right weapons and armor.-Running in a fight head first and attacking without thinking may have you soon surrounded by enemies and result in a fast death.-Bossfights. What would a Souls/Borne/Sekiro game be without bossfights?! The bosses here are, as expected, quite hard when you face them the first time. Some may be easy in general, but every single boss is unique, with his own skillset, moveset, strengths and weaknesses. No matter what path you choose for your character and how you play the game, there are challenges for every player type. Fights you find to be easy may be torment for others and fights wich other palyers find easy you may struggle to get through.-There is no ""perfect build"" or ""easy mode"". You must understand what you are doing wrong and correct it, or maybe even change your gear if you find your weapon, for example, being too slow or too weak for a boss you are struggling with.-The player decides on their own how they build their character. You are free to choose when you level up and how you spend your level points in the different stats of your character.-When you die you loose your ember status. To restore it (wich increases your max health by 30% and enables the ability to summon other players to your world and also to be invaded by other players, if you play online) you have to either beat the next boss or consume an ember.-Also when you die, like in the other Dark Souls games, you drop your souls and it gives you one chance to go back to the spot where you died and retrieve your souls (the currency you receive from defeated enemies, wich you can spend to level up, buy items or upgrade your weapons). If you die again before you retrieve your dropped souls you loose them.-Stroger enemies give more souls, so while you progress thorugh the game you have a higher income so to speak but also each level up increases the cost of the next level up a little bit. Also you can find souls as items and you can sell the items you find for souls.-Dispite what the internet wants you to believe, Dark Souls 3, like all Souls/Borne/Sekiro games, isnt that hard. The difference compared to other games is simply that you dont get everything shoved in your face. You have to learn through failure. The game demands from you to overcome your enemies and ""git gud"". It will never just hand a victory over to you, but the more you will enjoy every single victory, as you actually achieved it either through skill and timing or through clever use of your equipment and patience.-Dark Souls 3 has plenty of help built into it, but you decide wether or not you open the help menu and read what the stats of your character and equipment do, you decide if you stop and read the developer messages or not, you decide if you open the item descriptions and read what each item does.-The hard thing here is to learn from your mistakes, to bring the willpower to endure failure and grow to be able to succeed. You have to turn on your brain and understand the strengths and weaknesses both of your enemies and your self.Overall Dark Souls 3 delivers a verry enjoyable experience.It offers a decent challenge for new and experienced players alike, while never being really unfair.The world is immersive, the lore goes as deep as Souls lore goes and the presentation is impressive.Gameplay is verry good and the atmosphere is amazing.If you are up for a new challenge or if you are already familiar with Dark Souls and seek more of that experience i can highly recommend this game to you.On the other hand if you are verry impatient and dont like to invest time into completing a game then this is clearly not the right game for you.",1

Positive,"Dark Souls III is everything you wanted from the first Dark Souls, and leaves out what made you dislike Dark Souls II. While I will continue playing this game even after completing it; I wanted to give you guys a proper review.Environment is breath taking, and puts the earlier Dark Souls games to shame in comparison.Far more interesting enemies than humans in armor, including bosses.Nostalgia is strong with this game, and you'll love every reference thrown your way.AI improved dramatically, so enemies are going to give you a challenge.Weapon variety is great, which also applies to armor.Armor cannot be upgraded, so wear whatever you want. Fashion souls is back!If you love exploring, this game will consume you. Easy to get lost in.So many shortcuts, secrets, illusionary walls, you'll always stumble on something new.Co-op is easy to access, and hardly any problems with the server.Character creation offers a ton of options for making your character stand out.Each weapon has a special ability, making each one unique on it's own.NPCs are really developed, and don't stay in one spot. They're also very likable too.Quests are back, so you can go back to certain areas and activate new events.If you like horror films, this game has some nightmare fuel for yah.Can now get your flask out during a fight without searching through slots (hold down on down depad).Replayability is a solid option for sure. You'll most likely have multiple playthroughs.Enemies don't despawn, so you can grind to your heart's content.Your covenant changes the kind of invader you are (sunlight makes you a golden red phantom).Soul Memory is gone, so get as many souls as you want for upgrades / items.Four endings to earn, each offering a strong impact to the story.Heavily influenced by Bloodborne's mechanics, so most enemies are fast & furious.Enemies don't really have a stamina limit, so they can spam their combos for awhile.Lack of spells, hexes, miracles, and pyromancies. They're all cool, but not many to be found.PvP is sluggish, inferior to Dark Soul 2's PvP which was fun and balanced.Certain enemies can't be beaten unless you have certain items or do certain tasks.Game can feel short if you don't take the time to explore any optional areas.Until you reach more than half way into the game, weapons are hard to upgrade.Too many ambushes, which leaves you less surprised when it happens again.Most enemies have higher poise than you, so you're going to be dodging / blocking more often.Game is more demanding with graphics than Dark Souls 2, so you might need to turn certain options on low.Certain areas make the FPS drop, or lag so be ready for that.Tends to crash now and again, depending on what you're doing.Covenants are weak, and not satisfying to rank up in.Invasions / invading isn't fun because again PvP is sluggish, wonky and poorly done.NPCs can die easily from anything, so an enemy can kill them during mid conversation.Ember is hard to find, but luckily helping hosts gives you one per successful mission.NPC enemies / invaders deal more damage, have more HP & poise than you. Unfair.Can lose the chance on getting items / armor if particular quests failed.Greatswords and weapons alike are either weak or OP, there is no middle ground.Game rewards you for being aggressive & spamming over thinking carefully like previous games.Luck is useless due to the fact you can grind enemies without them despawning.Is Dark Souls III worth getting? YES. It's an excellent game and despite there's a lot of issues I have here and there with it, they did an excellent job making this game spectacular. NPCs are engaging & very interesting, bosses along with nearly every enemy possess unique designs, almost all the weapons are handy in doing something useful, co-op is very enjoyable to be a part of, scenery & the setting is absolutely beautiful (even in the areas meant to look ugly are appealing to the eye), and each build is going to be fun to experiment with. Granted, it's a shame that the game wants you to play it like you're in Bloodborne instead and most of the enemies are way to hostile & fast for their own good, but otherwise this game is a solid 8.5 out of 10 for me. Worth full price, plus we haven't even gotten the DLC yet! Hope you guys were able to get most out of my review, and please feel free to ask me any questions about the game!",1

Positive,"Wow just realised that after devoting 400+ hours and 100% completion of this title i haven't recommended it. Obviously i recommend this, its hard but not unfair the lore is extremely deep but takes a lot of investigation via item descriptions and environmental ques. but every item, every placed creature, or background furniture. Is placed with purpose to provide the story and build the tragic world you are experiencing.",1
Positive,"Dark Souls 3 is the final Soulslike game I played, having played before every other one made by FromSoftware. Visiting the same old places from Dark Souls 1, and meeting the same characters or their descendants, seeing those signs and landmarks was so special to me.I love games where there's continuity, and coming to DS3 as the final game in FS's Soulslikes catalog, and seeing familiar faces and places was the icing on the cake to me, it made the whole journey so exceptional and so real.Every time I entered a new area, to me that was my favorite area, and no bonfire was lit without a memory, or a nod back to the past and to DS1 being felt, seen, heard, or invoked in my head. This alone made the game incredibly special. How it tries to tie everything together and put an end to it all. Albeit what is an end really is up for debate, if there's such a thing whatsoever.The amount of weapons, spells, shields, and armor sets is staggering. They went all in, no matter what kind of stick you like to wield, it's here. Some of the most memorable boss fights are here, seeing good old, and grey, Anor Londo again was worth the world to me. The Firelink Shrine being displayed on my screen sent a shiver down my spine. All of Gwen and Gwynevere's statues, Onion bro, Andre, and Havel.I think whatever can be said about the gameplay or the game itself has been said before throughout the years so I would like to talk about something that was never said before, about how this game made me feel.Pathos, what the Greeks used to describe as emotions. Something that already resides in us (Dark Souls 1 (and 2) and their events) and was invoked at every turn, the linking of the fire, our duty, our sense of purpose which we remember and hold ever so close to our hearts so we don't go hollow, the state of the world, and its inhabitants, and the eternal unanswerable question, why are we here? The whole thing went before my eyes, and I find it hard to talk about now, there's just so much, I feel so much yet I can't pour it into words and I think that is exactly why I love those games so deeply. It's that elusive invisible thing that you feel as you concur the game, as you bear the duty, O branded one, of linking the fire and renewing the world for again that is your duty. And perhaps, that's simply why you are here.To me, it wasn't about gaining power, ascending, or traveling through the cosmos, all of those are themes we have seen before in their games, to me it was about doing what I was meant to do, for this fight is a fight for the flame, for my fellow kin and one where I wasn't about to squander.Prithee, Hollow, is this not what we were rallied for and to the Asylum up north sent to achieve?Prithee, Hollow, is this not why we jumped into the raging sea in Things Betwixt?And, Prithee again, Hollow, is this not why we wake up and head to our home, the Firelink Shrine, where it all first began just to end again?From a Nameless, accursed Undead, unfit even to be cinders. to a true Lord, fit to link the Fire.This is what it is about to me. It does not matter where we came from, or what we are, what matters is what we do with the little knowledge we have, in the face of the dying, crumbling, and lonely reality we are in.Similarly, IMO, it is as is our journey in real life, we know not where we came from if we had existed before, nor do we know where we are headed exactly after, if to any place. But in my opinion, what matters is the journey and, ironically, as you build your character in Dark Souls in the game, you are meant to build your human self character in real life. One and the same, and all driven by one's choices, in a world where we presumably had no choice about anything whatsoever.Our weaknesses and hollowness could never stop us from rising again and marching on towards achieving our duty, zealous as ever and brave as ever.Once a choosing undead, is now a Lord of Cinder.",1

Positive,"I rate this game: 9.5/10!1st off; This game is my introduction to the series. Dark Souls III is a game that wasn't on my radar, wasn't planning to play, didn't think I would enjoy. It is a game that viewers on my Twitch Channel (The Chronicles of Euther[www.twitch.tv]) challenged me to play. In short, Viewers were betting subscriptions -vs- me not dying more then 1000 times. I took that bet and streamed the entire game on Twitch. I died approx 700 time before 100% the base game. This game cost me two- (2) controllers. The right trigger snapped two- (2) times. It was truly an experience worth struggling (and I mean struggling) through and I invested 374 hrs in this game to date. Regarding the story line and Lore, you will have to due some reading on the internet. There are side stories, too, and you really need to pay attention to what the NPCs say, or you will miss something. No doubt.Dark Souls III is an action role-playing video game developed by FromSoftware and published by Bandai Namco Entertainment for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Microsoft Windows. An entry in the Souls series, Dark Souls III was released in Japan in March 2016 and worldwide in April 2016.It was/is critically and commercially successful, with critics calling it a worthy and fitting conclusion to the series. It was the fastest-selling game in Bandai Namco's history, shipping over three million copies worldwide within the first two months after release. A complete version containing the base game and both downloadable content expansions, titled Dark Souls III: The Fire Fades, was released in April 2017.This game will test your patience, fortitude and emotional state. I can not count the amount of times I RAGED playing this game.The game is played in a third-person perspective. Players are equipped with a variety of weapons to fight against enemies, such as special weapons, bows, throwable projectiles, and swords. Even shields can act as secondary weapons but they are mainly used to deflect enemies' attacks and protect the player from suffering damage. In addition, attacks can be evaded through dodge-rolling. YOU WILL DO THIS ALOT! I'm not kidding. Bonfires, serve as inventory, Save and Travel checkpoints. ""Ashes"", play an important role in the game (you will have to find this out yourself. Magic is also featured in the game, known as ""focus points"" (FP). When performing spells, the player's focus points are consumed. There are two separate types of Estus Flasks in the game, which can be allotted to fit a players' particular play style. One of them refills hit points, while another, newly introduced in Dark Souls III, refills focus points.Combat and movements are fast and fluid. The mechanic are will done. Several player movements (such as backstepping and swinging heavy weapons) can be performed pretty rapidly, allowing players to deal more damage in a short period of time.Throughout the game, players encounter different types of enemies, each with different behaviors. Some of them change their combat pattern during battles. You will need to spend time LEARNING (through trial and error) about each enemy to defeat them. The game places more focus on role-playing; the expanded character builder and improved weapons provide the player with more tactical options. Finally, the game does features multiplayer elements like the previous games in the series. I was really surprised how much fun I had playing with other players too. It was a blast.Finally, the visuals in this game are phenomenal! I kid you not. If that is your ""thing"", you are going to be amazed. Here is the link to my Screenshot Wall.

Positive,"This is a great Souls game, and in my opinion, a great game overall. I really enjoy the combat, audio, and if you are able to stomach the fact that the mouse and keyboard controls aren't great, it plays well with a controller.The world design is pretty good, but seems a bit linear. There are connections and shortcuts throughout the game, but the path is still one and you gotta follow it to progress through the game. The ability to teleport from each bonfire is also a proof of the linearity, since it would take ages to move from an area to the other, just by running. The story is told in a great way, for those who take their time to analyze and actually ""study"" the game environment. Storytelling is done throughout the game by environments, enemy placements, items description, drops, so on and so forth. Basically every element of this game is telling a story. This game is great. Would recommend it? Definitely.",1

Positive,"DS III is a best of souls series for me. There are a good memories about it. I just wish they had more time to complete the game as they saw it - with more bonfire mechanics and many more content. I think DS III is great game, but if final release of the game would kept world as it intended to be, it would be a perfect game for me. Still waiting for possible (?) complete edition with all cut content.",1
Positive,"DS3 delivers a great Dark Souls RPG experience more akin to the first Dark Souls than DS2. Fun boss encounters with a variety of builds possible. Would recommend installing the Cinders Mod to fix ""issues"" with base game like poise/making all builds/weapons viable. Be way of online play as you might encounter hackers & interacting with them may get you ""banned"" from the online matchmaking.Dark fantasy action combat (Souls-like) RPG If you're familiar with previous Dark Souls games, the gameplay for the most part is the same. You begin by creating a character and picking a starting class (e.g. Knight, Pyromancer, Sorcerer) with predefined stats and equipment. You progress from area to area killing monsters and absorbing souls from fallen enemies. At the world hub, you can spend your souls to upgrade your stats to make the build you see fit. Bonfires are scattered around and are basically zone checkpoints that you return to once you die, or you can teleport from one bonfire to any other bonfire in the world. You progress through the game by clearing zones and killing the zones' bosses, namely a specific set of bosses need to die before the game's final boss becomes available but you'll eventually encounter every other boss along the way. In terms of what is new in DS3 that isn't found in DS1 or DS2, DS3 introduces weapon arts to the game which are pretty much a secondary attack style/animation (besides from the L1/L2 attack) inherent in pretty much every weapon in the game. Weapon arts expunge the FP (blue) meter to use and therefore have a finite amount of uses like spells. The art style of DS3, like previous Dark Souls titles, is deliberately very bleak and oppressing. The world lacks much color and gives you an apocalyptic feeling as everything in the world is soulless and wants to kill you. The environments and game effects are nicely textured, the weapons and armor and unique and interesting, animations are great and give you a clear sign of what an enemy is attempting to do, and overall everything came together nicely. Some areas can get quite dark so bring a torch/light spell if you can't see so you don't get surprised by a mob lurking in the shadows. You play the role as the Ashen One, an undead who rises from the grave to fulfill the purpose of returning the souls of the Lords of Cinder to their thrones in order to end the curse of the undead and end the cycle of the First Flame. There's a lot more going on that you have do discover yourself by reading item descriptions and listening to NPC conversations. DS3 has a lot of lore to be discovered and if you are highly interested, there are many videos out there that explain it in much detail. DS3 feels like a return to form as most movement and combat animations are similar to the original Dark Souls. If you played DS2 and everything in that game felt/looked awkward, you'll be happy to know that's been rectified here. The game can be a great challenge for newbies and veterans alike. You are constantly kept on your toes on the lookout for possible enemy ambushes as there are plenty of deliberate item and enemy placements throughout the game. Hundreds of weapons, armor pieces, and rings to equip and create a build from. The introduction of weapon arts makes weapon choice a lot more interesting as you can choose a weapon based on its attack style/specific weapon art properties. Boss encounters are unique and fun. Only a few are gimmicked to be defeated a certain way, but otherwise you can defeat them how you want: solo, with help, with swords, with magic, etc. PvP exists in the form of covenant-based/red-orb invasions where players intrude into other online players' instances and attempt to defeat them by however they choose to. There are also unofficial but more honorable PvP locations where players duel each other and usually abide by a set of honorable rules (e.g. no healing allowed). Technically, PvP is an opt-in feature as you can disable all PvP by playing in offline-mode, but that would also disable co-op viability. The Cinders mod is touted as the ""definitive way"" to experience DS3 as it brings into the game armors and weapons from previous Dark Souls games, fixes & enhances the poise system in the base game, mixes up enemy placements in the world/adds new enemies into previous zones, creates alternate routing by connecting previously unconnected zones, and adds in toggleable difficulty settings in Firelink Shrine to make the game even harder for the veterans out there. Did my most recently playthrough of DS3 as an all-around caster using Cinders and it was great fun. Gets my recommendation for sure. Online play is a hit or miss. You can run into legit players doing some honest (or not so-honest but at least not cheating) PvP, or you might encounter someone who just one shots you (because cheats). This is a double-edged sword as interacting with hackers might get you on a banlist that matchmakes you only with other people that are also on the banlist. It's a slippery slope that I cannot provide much insight on as I haven't played online since 2016. When I last tried building a caster in 2016, I recall that it felt very underpowered/underwhelming. I don't know if casting has since been buffed, but playing as a caster felt comfortable and natural with the Cinders mod so you might want to use the mod if you decide to create a build in such a fashion.8.5/10A good return to the feeling of DS1 and a good departure from the dread of DS2. Solid RPG combat, a deep & engrossing world if you choose to look into it, and an overall fun time killing everything before it kills you. Checkbox reviews are lazy copy & paste bullsh*t. ASCII art reviews tell you nothing. ""Let's be honest, I only wrote this review for awards"" is a waste of everyone's time. If you are interested in genuine & detailed game reviews, feel free to check out my others here (or don't, I don't tell you what to do).",1

Positive,"Dark Souls 3 is the souls game that we wanted, and it is the souls game we got. As the smoothest and most refined of the trio, DS3 takes what was good in DS1 and DS2. and expands on it (aside from no power-stancing).To start, the gameplay is extremely smooth, and combat works exactly how you desire it. One of the biggest issues I had with DS2 was that combat felt clunky. That issue does not exist with DS3. Due to DS3 being a lot more modern than DS1, the combat also just feels more fleshed out. You still have your melee, ranged, magic builds, but DS3 introduces a mana bar. I still think the game was meant to be played melee, but whatever build you do is up to you.Bosses were extremely memorable and scale up pretty reasonably. The bosses in the early game are manageable even if you are new to souls, especially since quite a few of them are gimmick bosses. However, we get some of the most memorable bosses across the souls games in DS3. Whereas in DS1 we had many extremely memorable bosses, DS3 introduces a large plethora as well (DS2 bosses were overall less memorable IMO). Some of the ones I thought were most memorable include: Nameless King, Lord of Cinders, Sister Friede (DLC), Gael (DLC), Lothric Princes, Aldritch, and Champion Gundyr. What's better is that DS3 is actually quite related to DS1, and you'll even revisit Anor Londo!Map design is also excellent for DS3, and you get some of the same stuff that we loved about souls in DS3. Most of the main world is connected in some way as a big map, with twists and turns bringing you to new regions that somehow link up again afterwards. Shortcuts, hidden paths, bonfires, etc. make the map and levels really fun to get through. One of the best feelings is when you'd been grinding for a while and then suddenly open up a shortcut via an elevator or something.The only part of the game that I highly disliked is the 100% achievement hunt. DS3 is basically souls achievement grinding on steroids, because getting all the rings takes so much time. Additionally, in order to get all the different spells, you need to max out covenants. To max out covenants, you need certain drops that were meant to be received via PvP. Now if I played DS3 when it came out, this should have been no issue because there were plenty of people playing online. However, years later now the online base has dwindled, making farming covenant items much harder. If you were to farm it PvE, it has an extremely rare chance to drop in certain mobs. making the PvE grind experience super super annoying, boring, and uninspiring. I ended up sticking it out for 100% to the end, but it was not worth it.Overall, definitely one of the most fun Souls games. I highly recommend you pick the game up and give it a swing. You will not be dissappointed.",1
Positive,"This is the best Souls game to start in my opinion.It's beautiful, stylish, brighter (ironic) and alot more dynamic.The characters are great and lovable (some aren't but still).The game still maintains its difficulty and unique style.also.YOU CAN HAVE SOLAIRES ARMOR CMON GUYS WHAT ELSE DOES A MAN NEED?!",1

Positive,Its an ok game I guess,1
Positive,"In the short time that I've been playing this game I've already been blown away with the return of a true Souls experience. The Combat is quick and responsive and the enemies feel much more intelligent. The first thing I noticed with DS3 over the others is how incredibly smooth it is. Dodging has never been so fun! They've added a few things to make the initial start a little less aggravating, without over-doing it and making it too easy.",1
Positive,"It's Dark Souls 3 so if you're a fan of the series then you'll know exactly what to expect - - Awesomely responsive and intuitive combat.- You'll die a lot.- An immensely detailed and dark fantasy setting.- Loads of cool weapons and gear to dress your dude or lady up in.- You'll pick up items with vague and cryptic descriptions and think ""What the fuck is this and what the fuck does it do?""- You'll die a lot.- It's HARD but fair and nowhere near as difficult as people who don't play the series think it is.- You'll die and shout at your screen something like ""Bullshit!"" and then come back and try again about 25 times.- There will be huge, scary bosses to fight and you'll think to yourself ""I'll never beat this"" and then on the 10th try you'll beat it (Summon someone to help, no one will judge you) and scream at your monitor.- You'll reach that point in every Souls game where you have to bite the bullet and do some grinding to get STRONGER!- You'll probably spend more time exploring wiki's than playing the actual game.So Yeah, it's the Dark Souls we all love and it's pretty great.",1

Negative,"Love the Dark Souls series. Love this game. Lots of great challenges, loads of good lore, lots of good times on multiplayer. Why am I leaving a negative review? Hackers have ruined the online experience. And for me, online play is a huge appeal in these games. But after years of playing and over 100 hours logged, a single hacker throwing hacked items into my inventory has banned me from online play. Nevermind the fact that I hit alt-f4 immediately after I saw this happening. Nevermind the fact that I loaded a backup save from before I even encountered the hacker. No. Bandai doesn't give a shit. A hacked item touched my account for 1 second. Now I'm deemed a turbo-hacker in Bandai's eyes and I can't play with my friends, which is why I came back to this game in the first place.I will change my review if and when Bandai decides to not punish players who make active strides to circumvent the efforts of hackers and want to play the game legitimately.",0
Negative,"You know the drill. Dark Souls 3 single-player is great and worth price of admission alone. Contrary to the memes, the game is not that difficult. It s true!Then why the negative review, you ask? Because Dark Soul 3 s thoroughly lacking net code for online play is extremely dangerous. At the time of writing, at least two different unpatched Remote Code Execution (RCE) exploits in Dark Souls 3[duckduckgo.com] have been found. RCE exploits allow bad actors to execute arbitrary code on a player s PC remotely. RCE exploits are the Dark Souls of cyber security. I cannot understate the severity of this. And Dark Souls 3, when connected to online multiplayer, leaves your system wide open.The first RCE exploit, found and detailed in April 2021, has persisted for almost a year without any reaction from Bandai Namco & FromSoftware. It fell on the community to provide unofficial anti-cheat software (entitled Blue Sentinels )[www.nexusmods.com] to protect Dark Souls 3 players from malicious actors online.The second RCE exploit was made public in January 2022 by members of the Dark Souls community. (The exploit had already been previously reported to Bandai Namco & FromSoftware in December 2021[www.fanbyte.com].) As of today (2022-02-09) online play in FromSoftware s Souls games (DS, DS2, DS3) has been disabled for more than two weeks[www.theverge.com] following a public demonstration of this second RCE exploit on twitch[clips.twitch.tv], ostensibly to mitigate risk and give FromSoftware time to fix the issue before the launch of ELDEN RING (2022), which is assumed to share a considerable part of its net code with the older games. The fact that the revelation of the first RCE exploit last year did not warrant an immediate and coordinated response from Bandai Namco & FromSoftware is frankly unacceptable. Adding insult to injury, it took a second RCE exploit and the resulting financial risk of it torpedoing the launch of their highly anticipated next title to actually spur Bandai Namco & FromSoftware into action. Needless to say, this is extremely irresponsible behaviour by a software firm selling its product to millions of customers. The only silver lining is that the temporary take-down of online functionality at least mitigates the present security risks. A much belated software patch to fix the exploits might be incoming.Buyers beware.",0

Here in Brazil, this game is actually more expensive than Elden Ring (and there wasn't a single instance where they put this game on sale during the entirety of 2022, check SteamDB),. A complete joke by NAMCO. If you want this game, try to find another store to buy the key, I'm pretty sure they're way cheaper than through Steam.EDIT (July 30th 2023): They lowered the price a little bit, now it's costing the same as Elden Ring. It's still super expensive for a 7 year-old game nonetheless.",0

Lost all progression multiple times and got put into a more difficult game.A fix is a MOD, not something official by the developer. I would not recommend getting this game until this is fixed. If you already own it, I would strongly recommend you to use the Blue Sentinel mod. Spend more than 100 hours ""getting gud"" only to be one-shot by a naked dude with a massive weapon hidden in his prison pocket. 10/10, would recommend. On a more serious note: Beautiful scenery with a bittersweet ""story"", rewarding combat and adrenaline inducing fights. This game keeps dragging me back in, play through after play through.

A hacker happen to join into your game. they can do weird stuff like force adding stats, forcing items into your characters and mess up your save files and you'll be ban and burn in hell for it. and there are many hackers out there. game will force you to delete your savefiles. all those time you invest into leveling will be gone. If you wanna buy this game to experience online PVP coop. you have to accept that you risk lose your characters and all your sht at anytime. all those hours, days, weeks invested, gone. its really frustrate. its a great game tho if you wanna buy it and dont care much about pvp and just wanna enjoy sp story. but you have been warned.",0

Negative,"The point of this review is to point out the flaws and problems with the game. To help people make an informed decision before buying the game. You should always read multiple reviews, not just one. It's with a heavy heart that I write this review. It is of course my personal opinion. As a player with several thousand hours between Demons souls, Dark souls on PS3 and PC, Dark souls 2 on PS3 aswell as on pc, Dark souls 2: SotFS on pc, and Bloodborne on PS4, I feel I am obligated to write this. For the record, this review will change if the current state of the game improves, but as it stands, the game is not worth buying. While yes, it is a souls game, it is in a poor state. I'll first start by saying that I never played the japanese version, even though it released almost 3 weeks early there. That of course would allow for some sense of reassurance that many of the major issues with networking and balancing would be sorted out by the time of full release. Unfortunately, that's not the case. When the game fully released, the first area of the game after getting to the main hub was in essense broken. For whatever reason, the game made it almost impossible for a lot of people to see summon signs of friends while using the password system. The system that is supposed to make sure that those summon signs were the only ones visible to you and your friends. However, without a password, tons of signs were easily visible. Even if they were useless in the sense that 70% of summon attempts would simply fail and say ""unable to summon phantom"". So, 3 weeks early and the networking for the first area doesn't even work properly. Alright, moving on to the next area, summon signs without passwords still refused to work on a regular basis, and STILL DO at the time of my writing this. However, passworded signs would show up. This brings me to the next glaring issue, there are multiple covenants in the game that are dependant on automatically being summoned for an area to defend it or to defend a player who is already invaded. These covenants were next to useless when the game released as they would never send you to defend the area associated with your covenant. Thus making it that much harder to aquire the covenants items required to rank up to aquire certain spells and rings that are necessary for the acheivements. Unless you want to farm trash mobs for an hour+ to get your covenants drops. That's right, FromSoft was kind enough to add a method of grinding for the covenants that negates even needing to use them. Seems to me they knew that their networking was so broken that they made sure to add an offline method of doing covenants. Before anyone says, ""Well they put it there so people can play offline and still do all the covenants and such."" I doubt that someone so concerned with collecting all the items and such would play offline. Another interesting thing, is that the armor stat ""Poise"" (it's in armor pieces stat pages, on the character stat page and there's a ring dedicated to boosting poise) is turned off in the config files for players. However, NPC's still have it. It essentially makes actual defense stats more important than anything. Unless you use certain heavy weapons that have infinite poise while using a light attack. It makes trading with heavy weapons an impossibility if you're playing PvP as hitting them before their attack connects does not stun them and leaves you completely open for a full hit, which WILL stun you and give them a free second hit before you're able to roll away. And again, before anyone says ""git gud"", keep in mind I typically keep my builds lightweight and even use the carthus bloodring to improve my i-frames while dodging. Not being able to interrupt someone simply because their weapon is bigger and happens to give them hyper armor while swinging puts myself at a major disadvantage regardless of any factors. What else. Oh, the mind numbing difficulty of the game. I'm kidding of course. As far as souls games go, Dark souls 3, is objectively the easiest and most forgiving. Not only are most of the larger, tougher enemies either stun lockable with the help of a phantom, but the larger ones can be viceral attacked after connecting a few hits on them, usually killing them. Also, the difference between New Game and NG+ is negligable. I've completely the game 4 times already, both NG and NG+ and have been horribly dissappointed with NG+. The enemies are hardly any tougher, as you're character is already fully geared by the time you get there and just getting more powerful. Not to mention the signature addition of random dark spirit invaders and red phantom versions of normal enemies that would appear in NG+ in previous games, all the way back to Demons Souls. It's not a new concept, and it kept NG+ fresh and exciting. The ONLY thing to look forward to in NG+ over NG in Dark souls 3 is +1 versions of rings. And I've heard that the only thing in NG++ is +2 rings. It's a massive disappointment for more hardcore players like myself that liked the added challenge of turning a corner and running into a skeleton or hollow on steroids that hits twice as hard. It takes a lot of the hardcore ""YOU WILL DIE"" mentality that's been a trademark for souls games away and instead changed it to ""YOU WILL FARM"". I suppose another small thing to note is that large portions of the game feel highly unpolished and rushed. Some areas are breathtakingly beautiful, while others are full of large portions of texture and mesh completely missing, leading to literal holes in the world. Not to mention the weird graphical errors people get where everything goes wire mesh and turns bright shades of purple and green. Or players body texture clipping through armor when you hold a specific type of weapon as a specific gender. Or the fact that on full release, bonfires were one of the most dangerous things in the game, as they would cause a graphics driver kernel crash if you're lighting setting in the options menu was set to anything above low. A real kick in the ribs to players with high end pc's capable of running the game at max settings but being forced to tweak on setting to avoid crashes. Or the fact that after shutting down the game and restarting it, the game had a tendancy to reset the lighting setting to the recommended, detected setting without your knowing, causing crashes that you thought you'd fixed. Another thing of note, is that the game runs like trash on console. It does not play at an acceptable framerate on PS4 compared to pc. Looking at one, then the other, the difference is almost physically sickening. As stated above, this is my personal opinion, and this review is subject to being edited if the game sees improvement. I wish I could recommend it, but I simply can't, and it pains me to say that. I hope you found something useful or helpful in my review before making a purchase. Have a nice day.",0

Negative,"A game that I went into expecting to hate and was pleasantly surprised. Dark Souls 3 is fantastic, but unfortunately at the moment I cannot recommend it because of the utterly broken anti-cheat system.Cheaters are currently able to (and quite easily so) get innocent players permanently banned, as well as forcibly modifying stats, wiping inventories, etc. As a result, the online is unplayable for anyone who doesn't want to risk having their save ruined and get permanently banned from the online as a result. As time goes on, cheaters doing this will get more and more common, until the entire community dies off. Until Fromsoft/Namco Bandai does something to remedy the situation, I cannot recommend this game, especially not at full price.",0
Negative,"Dont mistake my negative review for disliking the game, I personally think the game is fantastic. However a remote code execution exploit (or RCE for short) has been discovered in the games netcode effectively making the game a virus for anyone who plays it online. This exploit allows anyone who invades your game or someone you summon to run code on your computer without your consent. This exploit can be used to simply crash someones game, or open up random programs on the users computer, steal private information, or even brick your PC.The community managed mod/anti-cheat Blue Sentinel has patched out the exploit and it is highly encouraged that you install the mod before playing the game. I have linked the mod below for convenience. https://www.nexusmods.com/darksouls3/mods/723While im thankful for the effort of the developers behind the Blue Sentinel mod and their speedy response in fixing the exploit, the community should not be responsible for making sure a product works and is safe for its user base this responsibility should fall on the developers and the publishers. I hope to see an official response from either Bandai Namco or Fromsoftware soon addressing the issue and insuring us this issue will not be present in the upcoming Elden Ring. Until then i cannot safely recommend a game that has the potential to harm your PC.",0
Negative,"An amazing game everyone should play at least once, but play offline, I'd rather eat broken glass than play the awful PvP system again, the starter areas are filled with individuals that use high-end gear to farm new players, usually putting them off the game permanently, it sucks. Oh, and don't forget the hackers. I've had some good experiences with the community, and I've also done what I can to add to that group, invading and giving people embers etc for free. However, good experiences online here are few and far between, avoid it like the plague and weep because we're definitely not getting any kind of private co-op mode for you to show your friends how great this game is without xX_NewbpWnAgE42069(InsertEdgyClanName)_Xx or 'shreklolXDXD' invading with a dark hand and caestus.Edit: 'You suck' and 'casul' is not a valid argument, especially when it takes no skill to stack buffs, equipment and stats for low SL invasion easy-mode time. I think you're a sad basement dweller if you feel the little endorphin high you get from winning an invasion matters in life, but the thing is, if you exploit new players for covenant items, YOU suck, not me.Edit edit: I believe in criticism quite wholeheartedly, but I'm also not very good with being spammed dumb insults in the comments section (although more depressing to read than good as insults). I thought I'd be able to handle that better, but it's just not something I am decent at it seems, which is sad because I really didn't want to disable the comments. Considered deleting the review but I think it's important to keep up as a little message on how idiots are ruining the online experience of a game that is otherwise what I'd consider the most immersive and fascinating fantasy universe ever written. Haven't received any constructive criticism to warrant keeping comments enabled, so, I'm sorry, I have anxiety, and not self-diagnosed, I gotta disable them so I'm not worrying about what's being said here 24/7 and tempted to reply to every 'git gud' or 'casul' comment.",0

Great Anti-cheat guys, So good that it even gets those pesky players who don't cheat.Update : I have recently been cleared of this anti-cheating flag and can resume playing the game.However the story is not the same for everyone, and I have since lost interest in the game due to being afraid to play at all if it would result in a soft-ban, barring me from the part of the game I enjoy most. The base game is fantastic with a few balance issues and optimization issues that I would normally recommend to people. However there is a lingering fear that should you continue playing this game online that you will someday be flagged or worse, soft banned while playing legitimately and until that is no longer an issue I will keep this a negative review.",0
Negative,"A dangerous remote code execution (RCE) exploit found in Dark Souls 3 could let a bad actor take control of your computer, according to a report from Dexerto. The vulnerability only puts PC gamers who play online at risk and may potentially affect Dark Souls, Dark Souls 2, and the upcoming Elden Ring. Servers for various Dark Souls games have since been shut down in response.The exploit was seen in action during The_Grim_Sleeper s Twitch stream of Dark Souls 3 online. At the end of the stream (1:20:22), The_Grim_Sleeper s game crashes, and the robotic voice belonging to Microsoft s text-to-speech generator suddenly starts criticizing his gameplay. The_Grim_Sleeper then reports that Microsoft PowerShell opened by itself, a sign that a hacker used the program to run a script that triggered the text-to-speech feature.RCE IS ONE OF THE MOST DANGEROUS VULNERABILITIESHowever, this likely wasn t a malicious hacker a screenshotted post on the SpeedSouls Discord may reveal the hacker s actual intentions. According to the post, the hacker knew about the vulnerability and attempted to contact Dark Souls developer FromSoftware about the issue. He was reportedly ignored, so he started using the hack on streamers to draw attention to the problem.But if a bad actor discovered this problem first, the outcome could ve been much worse. RCE is one of the most dangerous vulnerabilities, as noted by Kaspersky. It allows hackers to run malicious code on their victim s computer, causing irreparable damage, and potentially stealing sensitive information while they re at it.Blue Sentinel, a community-made anti-cheat mod for Dark Souls 3, has since been patched to protect against the RCE vulnerability. In a post on the r/darksouls3 subreddit, a user explains that (hopefully) only four people know how to execute the RCE hack two of which are Blue Sentinel developers, and the other two are people who worked on it, possibly referring to the individuals who helped uncover the issue.A representative for Bandai Namco, Dark Souls publisher, commented on a Reddit post in response to the issue, stating: Thanks very much for the ping, a report on this topic was submitted to the relevant internal teams earlier today, the information is much appreciated! The Verge reached out to Bandai Namco with a request for comment but didn t immediately hear back. I recommend to download the blue sentinel mod, report this to the software devs, don't recommend dark souls to anyone and don't pre purchase Elden ring until Software takes this situation seriously.",0
Negative,"Good game, but is PLAGUED with hackers that teleport, force instant death animations, prevent you from using separation crystal (forcing you to force close the game) and in other cases completely wiping ALL of your progress That's right, a hacker can invade you and simply erase countless hours of progress from your character. They can also force actions on your character that makes the game detect you as a cheater, penalizing you and BANNING you from online forever even though you didn't do anything. While this hasn't happened to me there are plenty of cases of it happening. I cannot recommend the game until this is handled properly by FromSoftware.

Negative,"Why negative review? One word:HACKERS.The game is full of hackers using teleport, being impossible to touch (but they can heal their friends or kill you), players that insta kill you or put items in your inventory that will be detected as hacking and you'll get banned.So until the hacker problem is taken care of and permabans start happening, the game is not worth it.There are also other problems that make the game not worthwile if you plan to play online:LAGIt's unbearable. Luckily there's a matchmaking option but guess what: it doesn't work at all.Brazillian players will parry you no matter what.Russian players will teleport to your back.Japanese and Chinese players will hit you from the other side of the map.It's, literally, unplayable.

Negative,"This is a fantastic game that I would recommend to everyone, if not for one thing:The state of online play. The game is plagued by hackers, capable of not only instantly killing other players, but corrupting their game files, or getting them banned by inserting invalid data into their account. With the ability to invade another player's game, encountering these cheaters isn't even something you have control over. I've just recently been banned in online play because OTHER players are cheating.

Negative,Way too hard for me. Lost my mind30 yo Boomer tho so I cant talk ill about the game. Its probably me issue,0
Negative,"This game is a very fun game, and I loved every second of it. However, FROM SOFT has ruined the game for me. 1. Softbaning. According to the anti-cheat software shoving its head up its ass I, and many, many other players, have been softbanned for no reason. CO-OP does not really exist for me any more, and apparently the invaders have given up on trying to get me as well. I'm basically playing a single player version of a multiplayer game because of some formatting error. On top of all that I deleted my main character because I thought it would fix the error message. So there goes 30 hours of my time, FROM, I hope you're happy. 2. Glitches. This game is riddled with glitches. Some of them allow enemies and other creatures to hop around the screen and attack you at lighning speed in seconds. It was not a framerate issue, it just happened for me. My game would sometimes give me delayed responces as well. Sometimes I would try to roll, but it would not happen. I did the most logical thing and tried to roll again, and I just ended up rolling twice. It was NOT a framerate issue. 3. Online Play. I'm not going to lie. My internet connection is not the best, but I get a decient ammount of bandwith that I have little to no trouble with playing other games in multiplayer mode. Most of, if not all, the games that I invaded orwas summoned into had Lagasaurous-Rex teir lag. Players would SLIDE across the screen in their idle position whilst making damaged gasps and attacking sounds. Enemies and BOSSES would revert to these stances whenever my host was attacked by them. It was incredably easy for me to backstab every enemy due to the extreme lag on FROM's servers. The worst part was the invaders and the bosses. Invaders would do the same thing as the host while attacking in their idle position. invasions turned into a spam fest because no one could tell what the others were doing. When bosses became like this I could not be damaged. I don't know if it was the fact that the boss was nowhere near me due to lag or the fact that an animation had to hit me to damage me. I don't know. However, the fact that this happened is outrageous for a game. Conclusion. Don't buy this game until it has been fixxed. Otherwise you may be banned for no reason, thus limiting the game, become frusterated when glitches ruin your fun, and generally become confused when everyone is in their freaking idle position.",0

Negative,"Great game just a real shame that hackers can force hacked items into your inventory thus getting you banned with no warning and no hope of getting it undone. Now this was already an issue and has been pretty much the whole lifetime of the game but recently Fromsoft/Namco Bandai removed the family and friends sharing option which was the only real defence you had for not getting your legit copy banned by sharing the game and playing it through a separate account so when/if you get banned though a third party acting maliciously you could still play the game as intended. (though it would normally cost you the current save as well up until your last manual backup assuming you though far enough ahead to manually back up your saves for an online game . . . )This only really harms legit players as hackers were already getting around the item checks and ban waves anyway and have been for a long time.Also, this means that anyone using legit mods (as in mods not made for cheating in PvP but changing the game itself adding more challenge e.c.t) now has a choice of playing the vanilla game as intended or using mods and catching a ban for doing so.This was a poor choice and really makes me think less of Fromsoft/Namco Bandai and makes me wonder if they will pull stuff like this further down the line with things like Elden ring.",0

Negative,"Edit: 5/5/2016 My review will be negative and it's gonna stay negative until From Software / BANDAI NAMCO adresses the issues allowing hackers to soft ban inocent players using the same lousy anti-cheat system it has proven to fail before, outdate and useless, until the wave of ppl softbanned STOP, i will NOT recommend this game to anyone and i will try to prevent ppl from buying this game until the anticheat system works properly.(Old Review)Today's Review: Dark Souls IIIOverview: Dark Souls III is the third delivery of the franchise (leaving aside Demon Souls) from the developer From Software for PC and consoles. This third (and supposed to be the last souls ever) boost overall what has been done in the past, for me at least raising the bar for fans and newcommers alike. Many will buy this game not fully getting that's basically a hardcore game, pretty much old school in the way that is meant to reward you for your hard efford, the game have 1 set difficulty and you will have to struggle, maybe coop with friends and try countless times until you get the grip of it, eventually you'll understand the mechanic of the game and you will die in ocations but in the end this is a really amazing journey within a story that i still don't fully understand, before i forget this is an Action RPG game, third person and for new ppl this is NOT something to take it lightly.First steps: At first when you start to understand what's an unkindled, a hallow, a lord of cinder, you will start playing a souls game, you will admire beautiful landscapes, amazing scenes while playing and cutscenes that are really well made until you get frustrated by being killed by any single enemy alone in the game, yet with perseverance comes strenght, you will succed if you keep trying, you will see the amazing many places this game have (tho linear, really restricted) and the amazing bosses and INCREDIBLE soundtrack, the gameplay for me was made to use a controller rather that the keyboard but that's up to you and one final thing, optimization has been done really good but the game's frames drops sometimes so it would be nice a patch to adress those issues.Final note: i have so much to say about the souls games and this one in particular, i might update this review later, for me this game it's a bit expensive at the moment but if you're looking for a challange then this is a great game. I'm happy i've got this one.Metascore: 82/100 ""Give it a try, if you don't mind losing your souls, unkindled one :)""",0
Negative,"Whilst I really like this game, I cannot recommend anyone buying it. There is a serious exploit making the rounds online that lets hackers mess up your save game really bad and Bamco and FromSoftware have been made aware of it a long time ago and they have chosen not to patch it.

Negative,"I actually very much enjoy this game and wish for many others to play it even now. The only reason I give it a thumbs down is because ""From Software"" neglects the PC players tremendously. There's hackers still in pvp that not only can use normal cheats, but crash your game through animation spamming that overloads your framerate and even WORSE than that. they can put items that are bannable into your inventory such as ""20 Storm Rulers"". No weapon goes beyond +10, so when you log in, the game detects ""unusual data"" and automatically bans you from being able to play. From Software has nothing to combat this and will take quite a while to unban you assuming you even have proof.Aside from that, PVP in this game, while fun. is kinda past its prime. Everyone's been playing this game for years already, the community agreed level cap of 120 goes overrated because people will new game plus and setup areas that are invaded frequently to become these ""fight clubs"". It gets really annoying being an Aldritch Faithful covenant member wanting to PVP when someone's in the territory, only to find out they cleared every mob and have 3 friends with them that were pre-summoned level 900+'s just looking for an easy gank. It kinda exploits the system and makes any genuine fun you'd get out of intentional designs, a bit hit and miss. I love invading and being invaded, but the system is very easily exploitable and not well designed.The story won't make sense at all, even if you've played the other 2 dark souls since every NPC's dialogue is cryptic and written with assumed context of you knowing what's even happening. You WILL spend mountains of time googling everything, from story to content you missed because it's very poorly explained. which is a good thing and bad thing imo. It creates a more genuine RPG feel but neglects the player's ability to understand or displays rather bad ""conveyance"". How are you supposed to know its your responsibility to do even half the things the NPC's say when half of them are just rambling about what you should do but are not actually capable of right?It's still a really fun game and I'll still be playing it, but From Software needs to take this down vote and realize they need to add anti-cheat software when it comes to PC games. Not only that but the balance in this game is. very questionable as the META ruins a LOT of pvp encounters you may have and even some of the PVE.Something to add. The playerbase is mostly toxic and meme based. Every name you come across is a meme, no one plays this game like an actual RPG, they just read it like a math exam and name themselves one of the following.""bruh""dude""Something Racist + word""Praise the Insert Meme here""dddddddddd""12345678""Cosplay as anime or character in game""I'm not much against the last one but damn after a while this just gives you an actual headache when you realize everyone treats this game like it's made specifically for memes. I miss when RPG's actually enveloped players and they were immersed in the environment they were in over being able to wave their shield button 90 times and throw dung to imply ur ""bad"".",0
Negative,why the fuck this game does not have a cloud system on saves.,0
Negative,"I have to say, genuinely, this is such a good game, and DS3 is the most quality version in PC platform.However, I hope I am not the only one who wants to critisie its file checking system, which results in so many true fans of DS3 got soft banned or even permenantly banned.Why? Because so many cheaters not only happy with editing their own files but also want to do so to others. They are able to use such as CE to craft a weapon which is not belong to the game, and this kind of weapon can achieve consequences like one-shot kill or 'back to level-1'. This very negative phenomenon causes many legal players banned by the system mentioned above when it identifies any 'invalid' date in their own files.What makes me even angry is, the game operators do not give a shit about it, especially for the customers in PC. They even stated that this is only our faults to 'play with' or 'recieve gifts from' thoes inappropiate players. However, could you plz tell me how can I avoid being invaded by these players? How can I know they are the ones? Someone might argue that YOU CAN JUST TRUN OFF THE ON-LINE PLAY OPTION. Yes, I can, if the online content is optional, I would rather ask a refund for castrating this content off.To sum up, if you really love this game and you like pvp and/or any other online game-plays, PC VERSION IS THE LAST OPTION.",0
Negative,This is a great game but the online dueling community is swarmed with hackers that will make your account get banned. I talked to support any they told me there is nothing they can do to unban my account because the main company is based in Japan. Very unfortunate that this amazing game is getting gutted by hackers on pc with no fix in site. If you must play this game I recommend offline but most of the content is made for online so you will feel lonely and like you are playing an incomplete game.Really hope Elden ring doesn't do the same auto ban system.Hackers are able to fill your character up with hacked items once you join their world. And even if you delete them right away you will still be flagged and banned.,0

Negative,"Honestly, I'm not a big fan of Dark Souls III. Truth be told, I kinda hate it. I'll say now that most of this is probably personal bias.To me, this game feels a lot more artifically harder than it needs to be. The lack of any hitstun from just wearing armour can be bloody unbearable sometimes, like when some tosser hits you with a knife and your guy staggers as if he just got hit by a bloody bomb while wearing full metal plated armour. And yeah, there are hyper frames when you swing with Great/Ultra Great weapons, I know.The melee combat is fine, obviously. It's a souls game, simple if you just boil it down to it's basics which would be ""press circle/b when bad man swings, press r1 to hit when bad man no swing"" just like the other games. The spell casting is different this time around, and I kinda enjoy it. It's probably one of the few reasons why I occasionally revisit this game. I find a fair amount of enjoyment rolling around a boss and throwing a massive orb of fire in their face, or slamming a lightning stake right into the feet whenever I get the moment to.The progression isn't too bad, I suppose? Upgrade Materials are fed out at a reasonable rate, though I dislike how rare infusion gems are. You get like what, one lightning gem the entire game unless you're willing to farm Lothric Knights? Good luck with that though. There doesn't seem to be many options early/mid game, either. The game might be a little rough early game if you pick a caster as a starting class, and dear lord pyromancer starts off with some awful stats which is fair enough I suppose since they also start off with pyromancy and high faith/int.The weapon arts are also new, kinda. Every weapon has some kinda gimmick attached to it that you can use when two handing, many straight swords have a Stance that allows you to break guards if you land the hit or close the distance with a lunge, some weapons can buff themselves, and some weapons have completely unique weapon arts. Weaponarts use FP, and to restore that you'll mostly be using Ashen Estus to restore that and you'll have to carefully balance what amount of Estus you convert into Ashen Estus to use both weapon arts and spells which is fair enough I suppose. Spells can demolish bosses pretty quick so you'll have to give up some healing to kill em with just spells, so carrying 20 soul spears and 20 estus (exaggeration, but still.)I don't really know what else to say, to be honest. It's a decent game I guess but I still kinda hate it. Maybe it's just not what I'd expect from a souls game or maybe I'm just awful. So maybe you'll like it, maybe you won't. Just keep in mind it is difficult at times and, in my opinion, it feels ""Hard"" for the sake of being ""Hard"" rather than challenging.And dear GOD the first DLC is bloody dreadful. It's short, some of the enemy encounters are just outright unfair and awful. DLC2 is. eh, I didn't like it. I suppose it's just more dark souls 3, really. Though it did have one boss I enjoyed, who was Gael. He's a pretty good fight and I had a lot of fun with that boss.",0

Negative,"Dark Souls 3 is a pretty decent single player game.The enemies are varied, the boss fights are engaging, the level design is great. I prefer Dark Souls 1 level design in particular, however, because teleporting was not an option until much later in the game; it made you feel like you were truly exploring the world, and everything was connected. Comparatively, you are now required to teleport to get to the first actual level in this game, and to subsequent levels. Teleporting was very seldom a requirement in Dark Souls 1.The way multiplayer/PVP is balanced is horrid.Sure, co-op with friends is good. Just as it always has been in the Souls series, when you look at the co-op aspect by itself. However there is a major problem. Now more than ever in this game series, invaders are urged to twink (at lower levels). Here's why: 99% of the time, invaders are matched with players who already have co-op phantoms in their world. Yes, the invading system favors hosts who already have their buddies with them, ready to gank your invading ass back to your world. Coupled with the covenant system where blue defenders can show up and gank you even harder, it's no wonder why invaders twink. They have to twink in order to win. And when these twink players invade a player and his friend who are playing normally, with no upgraded equipment and early-game gear, they become casualities to this idiotic system.When it comes to PVP at higher levels. Well, let's just say it's not fun. Since there is no poise as we're used to from DS1 (and to a lesser extent 2), and since shields are pretty useless except for a very small percentage, PVP is a roll-fest. Have full Havel's on? Prepare to get stunned by bare fists. You wanna use a shield below a greatshield? You better be ready to become a parry king through guesswork, or get shield broken and take repost damage. By the way, when it comes to armor, heavy and light are now not viable. The only truly optimal armor to wear is medium. It provides the best amount of defense in the game for the least amount of weight. Miyazaki got the title wrong, this should have been named Bloodborne 2.I say that because it's a game completely focused on dodging. You are encouraged to dodge, and that idea is exemplified by the fact that you basically have fast rolls until 70% weight ratio. Rolling is simply absurdly over powered and is essentially a core gameplay aspect. Regarding shields, all but greatshields are useless. All parry options now have a windup before the actual parrying window starts, and combined with the fact that attacks from enemies are much faster than in DS1, it's much harder to parry on reaction, if not impossible.Overall,I'd say if you want to play the newest Dark Souls game simply for the sake of it being a part of the Souls' series, do it. But if you're going to be playing, be prepared for what I have described.",0

Negative,"Dark Souls III is one of those few games that I love dearly, but can t recommend to everyone because of a number of different issues that bring the experience down. Fans of the series can possibly interpret my review as an overall positive experience, but new folks will need to consider the game more carefully. Hopefully, some of my gripes have already been addressed by developers. Let s begin with the performance.Dark Souls 3 continues the tradition of having areas that drop frames. It was a mostly stable 60fps experience for me, but dropping frames didn t do me any favors when I was carefully timing my movements. The frame drops weren t restricted to one area either. I had this problem over the entire course of the game. Some areas in the later portion of the game were really horrid. What also made me really sour was whenever I lost connection to their servers, I d be booted back to the title screen instead of just going into offline mode. I ve seen this happen during a boss fight. I also had a few crashes, but they were rare enough to not be a serious problem. Finally, I joined a significant number of other players worlds as a friendly phantom only to not be able to enter the boss s fog door. For reference, I am using a GTX 970 and an i7 4790K with 8 GBs of RAM and Windows 7.The combat in the game is very familiar if you ve played the previous games, but the weapon variety and weapon skills help spice things up. Wielding a weapon with both hands lets you use its weapon skill which can be anything from a special parry, firing three arrows rapidly, summoning lightning, having a new strong attack combo, a quickstep, or even giving yourself a temporary attack buff. Having more tools to handle a situation is a plus in my book and this game s implementation of it gives melee players an incentive to put the shield away. Weapon skills being available on every single weapon made combat feel much more entertaining, especially when the boss weapons have some of the boss techniques on them. I didn t engage much with spellcasting since I heard it required a lot of specialization. Pyromancy is still very accessible for characters, powerful, and looks great. The magic buffs in general are also well worth the effort to acquire for melee characters.However, the combat has significant flaws. Poise doesn t do what you would expect. Poise didn t keep me from being staggered by attacks and no matter how much poise I stacked, even the weakest hollows could stagger me without much effort. Because of how poise works in this game, heavy armor doesn t feel like it s protecting you as much since stun locks can still happen. I believe some spells and definitely some weapon skills can increase your poise to prevent stagger to allow uninterrupted attacks. For example, the Black Knight Sword has a skill called Perseverance which says Raise sword to temporarily boost poise. Damage reduced while activated. When this skill is used, you can avoid any staggering effects and attack without restraint. Notice how it says it s raising poise, yet any poise gained from any wearable equipment cannot avoid being staggered. They should have renamed the stat because of how confusing and misleading it is to have two different kinds of poise with very different effects. From what I read, regular poise has to do with vulnerability frames (not i-frames) with rolling. I suppose that s what they want from players, more rolling.The second major problem with combat is how the walls interact with players and enemies. You ll soon discover that as you try to attack through a solid object, you ll recoil from the impact. This recoil can occur when fighting near pillars or walls and makes sense when it happens. You don't have Kitty Pryde's phasing abilities. On the other hand, enemy attacks will ignore walls and strike you for full damage. I ve only seen enemy phantoms and two very large enemies recoil from trying to attack through walls or objects. One of those large enemies threw a chain axe through about 14 feet of wall and managed to hit me. There were far too many instances where enemies could attack through extremely thick walls or obstacles and still hurt you. I wanted tough, but fair, not this nonsense. I ve even seen some enemies shoot projectiles through walls. I don t understand why enemies are allowed to ignore solid matter to such a degree. I don t remember if the other games had this enemy behavior, but it s really obvious in this installment. At least the boss combat is pretty good.The boss fights in DSIII are very well paced and are much more memorable than DSII. There are less bosses which appears to have resulted in higher quality fights with unique and interesting movesets. The overly humanoid setup of DSII didn t make a comeback for this title. I enjoyed most of the fights and found myself pleasantly surprised at what the bosses brought to the table. Sometimes, the fights can change in a way that I ll not spoil here. I liked how they were designed, both mechanically and visually.Speaking of visuals, Dark Souls III is the best looking one in the series. It s a gorgeous game with gorgeous views. The environments also tie together pretty well. You can t exactly travel to all the places by foot, but if you can see it, you can probably go there. I greatly enjoyed how you can constantly see places that you ve been to in the background which gives a good sense of progress and where you are in the world. Seeing what s up ahead and thinking Oh man, do I get to go there too? is another thing that DSIII does very well. Here s an example of what I mean from very, very early in the game:I d also like to point out that there s no impossible elevator la Dark Souls II.Multiplayer is fairly pleasant, but From Software s approach to handling cheaters doesn t seem like the best approach, mostly because of how the innocent are soft-banned along with the guilty. Be sure to never, ever accept an item from a stranger, but unfortunately, sometimes that may not even be enough. In addition to that issue, some of the covenants have difficulty finding hosts. The game s matchmaking seems too restrictive which doesn t make sense since it s capable of scaling players down to the host s level. If you go and reach a high level with a character, be prepared to have a really difficult time reaching certain covenant ranks. The password matchmaking is quite good and allows friends to easily play with other friends. Just make sure you both spell the password exactly the same. I spent a large portion of my time engaging in jolly cooperation. I also did deliberate pvp which was also a good deal of fun. The multiplayer functions mostly and it s fun, but it carries the risk of contracting a digital STD. No one wants to be soft-banned unjustly. Yeesh.Whew, here are some other things that affected my time with DSIII: I ve seen my friendly phantoms die to an invader after I finished watching a boss intro cutscene, the patch notes for this game are vague to the point of being almost useless, the camera will sometimes work against you if you re too close to a wall, and the game has plenty of nods to the previous titles that sometimes turn into full body spasms.I really enjoyed Dark Souls 3, but hoo boy did I also grow frustrated with the game. I uninstalled and reinstalled it several times before finally keeping it uninstalled. I just grew tired of the problems it has, but I do acknowledge that there s still a great game in there to be experienced. It s just a darn shame that they went with the decisions they did that prevent the game from reaching its full potential. I was almost done with NG+ too. If you can look past its issues, prepare to buy.",0
Negative,"Let me Preface with thisI am a huge fan of Dark Souls and Bloodborne, (I've sunk well over 1k hours into each) I have played the second DS and didn't like it (Big suprise) and was looking forward to this one with optimisim and was hugely dissappointed Dark Souls 3 Is unbalancedI feel as if I am playing an early build where tweaking and rebalancing is in its early stages,Keep in mindI have multiple max all stat (all 99) characters I went to NG+9 and invested many hours into this game(Note I do not have very much PVP experience but I do have some. I am mostly reffering to Offline play in this review)1) Poise is non existant and worthless.Poise was a major factor in combat in DS 1. It allowed you to take hits without being staggered; if you had a high enough poise value. This allowed you to effectively trade blows with Mobs and Players. You could initiate an attack and not be staggered during the animation. Hyper armor is present in DS3 but it's situational at best. This leads to stunlock gameplay. The best/ultimate/only viable strategy for PvE is to equip all light armor and a weapon with good range and wide sweeping attacks to stagger every enemy in the vacinity and stun lock all of them. I.E. in the Boreal valley I used all light armor and the Wolf knight Great Sword to stagger ever enemy encounter before they staggered me and I got through the area unscathed. However if I tried to use heavier armor and trade blows I would loose everytime. So why bother using heavy armor at all? This brings up two more issues. Sheilds being useless, and enemy aggression/overall combat pacing.2)Shields. Sheilds have alway been a very usefull offensive and defensive item in previous souls games. The ability to throw up a shield and block an attack was invaluable. Enemy's blows could bounce off your shield and staggr your opponent creating an opening for you. Depending on the sheild taking a blow would not consume much stamina. However in DS3 I was onlyable to take 2 or 3 hits before my gaurd was broken on most normal sheilds. Thiswouldn't be a problem if the enemies werent so aggressive, but more on thatlater. The offensive side to sheilds in previous souls games in the Parry/Riposte Mechanic which also suffers in this game. I mastered Parrying in DS1 and as a result I could combat most enemies no problem. However in this game the parrying is almost entirely luck based. Enemies swing so quickly parrying is very difficult to perform. Especially when enemies have multi hit combos. Combined with the lack of poise and the stamina cosumed in blocking, screwing up a parry can cost you a fight. Great sheilds are also usless. They too consume a great amount of stamina when blocking attacks leading to frequent guard breaks. 3) Enemy AggressionThis is more of a personal opinion but I feel it still holds weight. Enemies are much more aggressive than they have ever been in a souls game. many enemies have multihit combos that result in the player being stunlocked due to the lack of poise. blocking does not help because your guard breaks easily. Rolling is the only efficient method to combat. Armor and sheilds are way to underpowered to deal with the aggressive enemies of DS3All of these issues lead to only one viable playstyle. Light rolling, and heavy weapons. Using Heavy armor is pointless as it yields no benefit. Shields can only block a few attacks at best before your guard is broken so why bother with them. The lack of poise leads to a stunlock gameplay. It feels as if I am playing bloodborne with a Souls skin. From should have made another bloodborne since they obviously wanted to4)Map designWhat is porbably my favorite design feature of DS 1 was the intricate map design. The waps were wooven together vertically which allowed for shortcuts and hidden passage ways. it was really interesting to explore the map and see how it folded back in on itself and how it flowed. Just the oter day I was playing DS 1 through again and I noticed that you can see Lost Izalith from the Tomb of The Giants bonfire. It made the map feel titly knit and jammed packed. Being forced to explore the map and every nook and cranny due to the inability to fast travel early on made me very familliar with themap. I now have it memorizeed like the back of my hand and can navigate it very quickly. However DS3 is rather linear. The map doesnt come together and suprise you like DS1 did. Its not a major issue I'm Just dissappointed slightly5) Hub WorldDS2 and 3 adopted a HUB approach to the game design. they forced you to return to a certain area to level up, upgrade weapons, and to purchase items. While in DS3 merchants, blacksmiths, andbonfires were all over the map. You could all your weapon upgrading, repairs, and leveling up from any bonfire. This allowed the game to flow and didnt interupt the exploration at all. Instead of warping back to a HUB and going through multiple loading screens just to level up I could instead do it all at a bonfire. This made my journey feel much more personal and lonely which really helped deliever the atmosphere of lonliness that Dark Souls nailed perfectly.The game does have some pluses however. It is visually stunning Some of the bossfights are fantastice. The music is top notchPvP from what I played is reasonably fun despite the many balancing issuesThe enviorments, while linear, are gorgeous and intterestingIt has interesting endingsthe Quests are fun and rewardingVoice acting is stellar",0

Negative,Servers were taken down for an exploit that was fixed by independent people in less than a week. There hasn't been a single public announcement since they said they were taking the servers down until after Elden Rings release.The prices for the souls games here on steam were all raised after the last major steam sale while there hasn't even been an attempt to update players on the plan for the servers. They are now charging more for literally every 'Souls' game on Steam right now more than they have in years. What are you getting for these hiked prices? Less of a game than you would've gotten when you could've bought the whole series for the price of one game. A bad deal if you ask me.,0
Negative,"BE CAREFUL IF YOU'RE GOING TO BUY ELDEN RING!Game has always had a cheater problem, which they've always ignored, and even ignored the guy who alerted them about RCE, and only now bc elden ring sales are now at risk they shut everything down and stay silent for 1 week (and counting), probably will last until elden ring releases.Only thing is, modders (including anti-cheat creator blue sentinels), already analyzed the code from the network test on elden ring, and the game's netcode is basically the same, so, until further notice elden ring is 100% certain to have the SAME exploits and cheats that all dark souls games already have, INCLUDING RCE.Keep in mind, this exploit is ALREADY FIXED IN BLUE SENTINEL since around jan 22, and a triple a company can't make this fix?
