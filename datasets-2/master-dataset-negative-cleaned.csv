Negative,"I heavily enjoy this game and do recommend it to people who read this, but I am going to review a negative review as a major exploit that lets hackers flat out reset your save file with a possibility of crashing your PC if they want is currently going around and causing lots of damage, and as such this thumbs down review will be a semi-silent protest to Fromsoft and Bandai to notice the sudden drop in positive reviews and see that this massive explot is the reason and fix it.Here's a link to where you can learn more about this exploit:https://www.reddit.com/r/darksouls3/comments/n1235k/potential_pc_security_exploit_spreading/Good luck to all, and hopefully your jolly co-operation stays jolly.",0
Negative,"Love the Dark Souls series. Love this game. Lots of great challenges, loads of good lore, lots of good times on multiplayer. Why am I leaving a negative review? Hackers have ruined the online experience. And for me, online play is a huge appeal in these games. But after years of playing and over 100 hours logged, a single hacker throwing hacked items into my inventory has banned me from online play. Nevermind the fact that I hit alt-f4 immediately after I saw this happening. Nevermind the fact that I loaded a backup save from before I even encountered the hacker. No. Bandai doesn't give a shit. A hacked item touched my account for 1 second. Now I'm deemed a turbo-hacker in Bandai's eyes and I can't play with my friends, which is why I came back to this game in the first place.I will change my review if and when Bandai decides to not punish players who make active strides to circumvent the efforts of hackers and want to play the game legitimately.",0
Negative,"You know the drill. Dark Souls 3 single-player is great and worth price of admission alone. Contrary to the memes, the game is not that difficult. It s true!Then why the negative review, you ask? Because Dark Soul 3 s thoroughly lacking net code for online play is extremely dangerous. At the time of writing, at least two different unpatched Remote Code Execution (RCE) exploits in Dark Souls 3[duckduckgo.com] have been found. RCE exploits allow bad actors to execute arbitrary code on a player s PC remotely. RCE exploits are the Dark Souls of cyber security. I cannot understate the severity of this. And Dark Souls 3, when connected to online multiplayer, leaves your system wide open.The first RCE exploit, found and detailed in April 2021, has persisted for almost a year without any reaction from Bandai Namco & FromSoftware. It fell on the community to provide unofficial anti-cheat software (entitled Blue Sentinels )[www.nexusmods.com] to protect Dark Souls 3 players from malicious actors online.The second RCE exploit was made public in January 2022 by members of the Dark Souls community. (The exploit had already been previously reported to Bandai Namco & FromSoftware in December 2021[www.fanbyte.com].) As of today (2022-02-09) online play in FromSoftware s Souls games (DS, DS2, DS3) has been disabled for more than two weeks[www.theverge.com] following a public demonstration of this second RCE exploit on twitch[clips.twitch.tv], ostensibly to mitigate risk and give FromSoftware time to fix the issue before the launch of ELDEN RING (2022), which is assumed to share a considerable part of its net code with the older games. The fact that the revelation of the first RCE exploit last year did not warrant an immediate and coordinated response from Bandai Namco & FromSoftware is frankly unacceptable. Adding insult to injury, it took a second RCE exploit and the resulting financial risk of it torpedoing the launch of their highly anticipated next title to actually spur Bandai Namco & FromSoftware into action. Needless to say, this is extremely irresponsible behaviour by a software firm selling its product to millions of customers. The only silver lining is that the temporary take-down of online functionality at least mitigates the present security risks. A much belated software patch to fix the exploits might be incoming.Buyers beware.",0
Negative,I kept dying because i was distracted by the oiled up blacksmith,0
Negative,Fix the servers please.,0
Negative,"This game is amazing, but I'm setting a negative score until NAMCO decides to set an acceptable price tag on this game. This is a 2016 game where they're charging full price. Here in Brazil, this game is actually more expensive than Elden Ring (and there wasn't a single instance where they put this game on sale during the entirety of 2022, check SteamDB),. A complete joke by NAMCO. If you want this game, try to find another store to buy the key, I'm pretty sure they're way cheaper than through Steam.EDIT (July 30th 2023): They lowered the price a little bit, now it's costing the same as Elden Ring. It's still super expensive for a 7 year-old game nonetheless.",0
Negative,"Honestly an amazing game. But this game was released in 2016 and still costs like the price of a 2023 brand new game (60 bucks), and is even worse in South America, where money inflation is a hell.

Negative,"I got banned because someone else was hacking and injected items into my inventory, they say if it happens again I'll be perma'd. Yeah thanks, better not get invaded or summoned ever again. Don't make backups either, that's a bannable offense.I'm not trying to pretend there's an easy fix for hacking without a better anticheat, but anyone can tell that a system that allows cheaters to ban innocent players is worse than no system at all.EDIT: LOL there's an RCE exploit",0
Negative,"I'm editing this review later on into a proper one, but I'm leaving a negative review because Bandai is at it again trying to straight up rob people with their prices in south america.There's no excuse for these prices, since they can still load their pockets from people who can actually pay for them in first world countries, so I'm putting negatives on every game that updates prices to unreasonable amounts in a market that actually allows for regionalization.And for all my south american friends out there who can't pay for it: Just play the Jack Sparrow version, don't let them get away with it ;)",0
Negative,"I love this game, but cannot recommend it until FROMSOFTWARE stops banning innocent people for using programs that allow people to use controllers etc.",0

Negative,"Edit as of 28-05-2021: Hackers are running rampant in this game. Playing with a friend, and he got put into NG++, then after 30 min he got put into NG+4. Just playing co-op, no invasion or anything. Just a connection error and back to the start of the game it is. Lost all progression multiple times and got put into a more difficult game.A fix is a MOD, not something official by the developer. I would not recommend getting this game until this is fixed. If you already own it, I would strongly recommend you to use the Blue Sentinel mod. Spend more than 100 hours ""getting gud"" only to be one-shot by a naked dude with a massive weapon hidden in his prison pocket. 10/10, would recommend. On a more serious note: Beautiful scenery with a bittersweet ""story"", rewarding combat and adrenaline inducing fights. This game keeps dragging me back in, play through after play through. There is enough content to enjoy yourself and the DLC's are the cherry on top. If you like to challenge yourself and have the temper to not destroy your controller, you should definitely try it out! Stay safe, skeleton!",0
Negative,"This game is great i love it enjoy it alot.but it has the worst automated cheater detection ever.I just got banned for no reason. i died alot but i never hack, never cheat, never use any outside programsLike many other legit players that got ban because of their shtty ban system. and i swear that im not the first and wont be the last. In most common infamous case. A hacker happen to join into your game. they can do weird stuff like force adding stats, forcing items into your characters and mess up your save files and you'll be ban and burn in hell for it. and there are many hackers out there. game will force you to delete your savefiles. all those time you invest into leveling will be gone. If you wanna buy this game to experience online PVP coop. you have to accept that you risk lose your characters and all your sht at anytime. all those hours, days, weeks invested, gone. its really frustrate. its a great game tho if you wanna buy it and dont care much about pvp and just wanna enjoy sp story. but you have been warned.",0
Negative,Can't co-op. Fix servers pls.,0
Negative,"3-30-22 i'm still unable to access the the online game server, and I suspect they think this issue is resolved, it is not. Do not purchase this game for download until they finally get off their ass and fix it for everyone. In addition, they conveniently leave out the fact that your save files will not go to the cloud, soyou will not find out until after the fact when you have a PC issue that requires reinstalling your operating system like I did, stupid me for not taking an image, but f*ck you for wiping out 464 hour of gameplay.",0
Negative,"The point of this review is to point out the flaws and problems with the game. To help people make an informed decision before buying the game. You should always read multiple reviews, not just one. It's with a heavy heart that I write this review. It is of course my personal opinion. As a player with several thousand hours between Demons souls, Dark souls on PS3 and PC, Dark souls 2 on PS3 aswell as on pc, Dark souls 2: SotFS on pc, and Bloodborne on PS4, I feel I am obligated to write this. For the record, this review will change if the current state of the game improves, but as it stands, the game is not worth buying. While yes, it is a souls game, it is in a poor state. I'll first start by saying that I never played the japanese version, even though it released almost 3 weeks early there. That of course would allow for some sense of reassurance that many of the major issues with networking and balancing would be sorted out by the time of full release. Unfortunately, that's not the case. When the game fully released, the first area of the game after getting to the main hub was in essense broken. For whatever reason, the game made it almost impossible for a lot of people to see summon signs of friends while using the password system. The system that is supposed to make sure that those summon signs were the only ones visible to you and your friends. However, without a password, tons of signs were easily visible. Even if they were useless in the sense that 70% of summon attempts would simply fail and say ""unable to summon phantom"". So, 3 weeks early and the networking for the first area doesn't even work properly. Alright, moving on to the next area, summon signs without passwords still refused to work on a regular basis, and STILL DO at the time of my writing this. However, passworded signs would show up. This brings me to the next glaring issue, there are multiple covenants in the game that are dependant on automatically being summoned for an area to defend it or to defend a player who is already invaded. These covenants were next to useless when the game released as they would never send you to defend the area associated with your covenant. Thus making it that much harder to aquire the covenants items required to rank up to aquire certain spells and rings that are necessary for the acheivements. Unless you want to farm trash mobs for an hour+ to get your covenants drops. That's right, FromSoft was kind enough to add a method of grinding for the covenants that negates even needing to use them. Seems to me they knew that their networking was so broken that they made sure to add an offline method of doing covenants. Before anyone says, ""Well they put it there so people can play offline and still do all the covenants and such."" I doubt that someone so concerned with collecting all the items and such would play offline. Another interesting thing, is that the armor stat ""Poise"" (it's in armor pieces stat pages, on the character stat page and there's a ring dedicated to boosting poise) is turned off in the config files for players. However, NPC's still have it. It essentially makes actual defense stats more important than anything. Unless you use certain heavy weapons that have infinite poise while using a light attack. It makes trading with heavy weapons an impossibility if you're playing PvP as hitting them before their attack connects does not stun them and leaves you completely open for a full hit, which WILL stun you and give them a free second hit before you're able to roll away. And again, before anyone says ""git gud"", keep in mind I typically keep my builds lightweight and even use the carthus bloodring to improve my i-frames while dodging. Not being able to interrupt someone simply because their weapon is bigger and happens to give them hyper armor while swinging puts myself at a major disadvantage regardless of any factors. What else. Oh, the mind numbing difficulty of the game. I'm kidding of course. As far as souls games go, Dark souls 3, is objectively the easiest and most forgiving. Not only are most of the larger, tougher enemies either stun lockable with the help of a phantom, but the larger ones can be viceral attacked after connecting a few hits on them, usually killing them. Also, the difference between New Game and NG+ is negligable. I've completely the game 4 times already, both NG and NG+ and have been horribly dissappointed with NG+. The enemies are hardly any tougher, as you're character is already fully geared by the time you get there and just getting more powerful. Not to mention the signature addition of random dark spirit invaders and red phantom versions of normal enemies that would appear in NG+ in previous games, all the way back to Demons Souls. It's not a new concept, and it kept NG+ fresh and exciting. The ONLY thing to look forward to in NG+ over NG in Dark souls 3 is +1 versions of rings. And I've heard that the only thing in NG++ is +2 rings. It's a massive disappointment for more hardcore players like myself that liked the added challenge of turning a corner and running into a skeleton or hollow on steroids that hits twice as hard. It takes a lot of the hardcore ""YOU WILL DIE"" mentality that's been a trademark for souls games away and instead changed it to ""YOU WILL FARM"". I suppose another small thing to note is that large portions of the game feel highly unpolished and rushed. Some areas are breathtakingly beautiful, while others are full of large portions of texture and mesh completely missing, leading to literal holes in the world. Not to mention the weird graphical errors people get where everything goes wire mesh and turns bright shades of purple and green. Or players body texture clipping through armor when you hold a specific type of weapon as a specific gender. Or the fact that on full release, bonfires were one of the most dangerous things in the game, as they would cause a graphics driver kernel crash if you're lighting setting in the options menu was set to anything above low. A real kick in the ribs to players with high end pc's capable of running the game at max settings but being forced to tweak on setting to avoid crashes. Or the fact that after shutting down the game and restarting it, the game had a tendancy to reset the lighting setting to the recommended, detected setting without your knowing, causing crashes that you thought you'd fixed. Another thing of note, is that the game runs like trash on console. It does not play at an acceptable framerate on PS4 compared to pc. Looking at one, then the other, the difference is almost physically sickening. As stated above, this is my personal opinion, and this review is subject to being edited if the game sees improvement. I wish I could recommend it, but I simply can't, and it pains me to say that. I hope you found something useful or helpful in my review before making a purchase. Have a nice day.",0

Negative,"A game that I went into expecting to hate and was pleasantly surprised. Dark Souls 3 is fantastic, but unfortunately at the moment I cannot recommend it because of the utterly broken anti-cheat system.Cheaters are currently able to (and quite easily so) get innocent players permanently banned, as well as forcibly modifying stats, wiping inventories, etc. As a result, the online is unplayable for anyone who doesn't want to risk having their save ruined and get permanently banned from the online as a result. As time goes on, cheaters doing this will get more and more common, until the entire community dies off. Until Fromsoft/Namco Bandai does something to remedy the situation, I cannot recommend this game, especially not at full price.",0
Negative,"Dont mistake my negative review for disliking the game, I personally think the game is fantastic. However a remote code execution exploit (or RCE for short) has been discovered in the games netcode effectively making the game a virus for anyone who plays it online. This exploit allows anyone who invades your game or someone you summon to run code on your computer without your consent. This exploit can be used to simply crash someones game, or open up random programs on the users computer, steal private information, or even brick your PC.The community managed mod/anti-cheat Blue Sentinel has patched out the exploit and it is highly encouraged that you install the mod before playing the game. I have linked the mod below for convenience. https://www.nexusmods.com/darksouls3/mods/723While im thankful for the effort of the developers behind the Blue Sentinel mod and their speedy response in fixing the exploit, the community should not be responsible for making sure a product works and is safe for its user base this responsibility should fall on the developers and the publishers. I hope to see an official response from either Bandai Namco or Fromsoftware soon addressing the issue and insuring us this issue will not be present in the upcoming Elden Ring. Until then i cannot safely recommend a game that has the potential to harm your PC.",0
Negative,"An amazing game everyone should play at least once, but play offline, I'd rather eat broken glass than play the awful PvP system again, the starter areas are filled with individuals that use high-end gear to farm new players, usually putting them off the game permanently, it sucks. Oh, and don't forget the hackers. I've had some good experiences with the community, and I've also done what I can to add to that group, invading and giving people embers etc for free. However, good experiences online here are few and far between, avoid it like the plague and weep because we're definitely not getting any kind of private co-op mode for you to show your friends how great this game is without xX_NewbpWnAgE42069(InsertEdgyClanName)_Xx or 'shreklolXDXD' invading with a dark hand and caestus.Edit: 'You suck' and 'casul' is not a valid argument, especially when it takes no skill to stack buffs, equipment and stats for low SL invasion easy-mode time. I think you're a sad basement dweller if you feel the little endorphin high you get from winning an invasion matters in life, but the thing is, if you exploit new players for covenant items, YOU suck, not me.Edit edit: I believe in criticism quite wholeheartedly, but I'm also not very good with being spammed dumb insults in the comments section (although more depressing to read than good as insults). I thought I'd be able to handle that better, but it's just not something I am decent at it seems, which is sad because I really didn't want to disable the comments. Considered deleting the review but I think it's important to keep up as a little message on how idiots are ruining the online experience of a game that is otherwise what I'd consider the most immersive and fascinating fantasy universe ever written. Haven't received any constructive criticism to warrant keeping comments enabled, so, I'm sorry, I have anxiety, and not self-diagnosed, I gotta disable them so I'm not worrying about what's being said here 24/7 and tempted to reply to every 'git gud' or 'casul' comment.",0

Great Anti-cheat guys, So good that it even gets those pesky players who don't cheat.Update : I have recently been cleared of this anti-cheating flag and can resume playing the game.However the story is not the same for everyone, and I have since lost interest in the game due to being afraid to play at all if it would result in a soft-ban, barring me from the part of the game I enjoy most. The base game is fantastic with a few balance issues and optimization issues that I would normally recommend to people. However there is a lingering fear that should you continue playing this game online that you will someday be flagged or worse, soft banned while playing legitimately and until that is no longer an issue I will keep this a negative review.",0
Negative,"A dangerous remote code execution (RCE) exploit found in Dark Souls 3 could let a bad actor take control of your computer, according to a report from Dexerto. The vulnerability only puts PC gamers who play online at risk and may potentially affect Dark Souls, Dark Souls 2, and the upcoming Elden Ring. Servers for various Dark Souls games have since been shut down in response.The exploit was seen in action during The_Grim_Sleeper s Twitch stream of Dark Souls 3 online. At the end of the stream (1:20:22), The_Grim_Sleeper s game crashes, and the robotic voice belonging to Microsoft s text-to-speech generator suddenly starts criticizing his gameplay. The_Grim_Sleeper then reports that Microsoft PowerShell opened by itself, a sign that a hacker used the program to run a script that triggered the text-to-speech feature.RCE IS ONE OF THE MOST DANGEROUS VULNERABILITIESHowever, this likely wasn t a malicious hacker a screenshotted post on the SpeedSouls Discord may reveal the hacker s actual intentions. According to the post, the hacker knew about the vulnerability and attempted to contact Dark Souls developer FromSoftware about the issue. He was reportedly ignored, so he started using the hack on streamers to draw attention to the problem.But if a bad actor discovered this problem first, the outcome could ve been much worse. RCE is one of the most dangerous vulnerabilities, as noted by Kaspersky. It allows hackers to run malicious code on their victim s computer, causing irreparable damage, and potentially stealing sensitive information while they re at it.Blue Sentinel, a community-made anti-cheat mod for Dark Souls 3, has since been patched to protect against the RCE vulnerability. In a post on the r/darksouls3 subreddit, a user explains that (hopefully) only four people know how to execute the RCE hack two of which are Blue Sentinel developers, and the other two are people who worked on it, possibly referring to the individuals who helped uncover the issue.A representative for Bandai Namco, Dark Souls publisher, commented on a Reddit post in response to the issue, stating: Thanks very much for the ping, a report on this topic was submitted to the relevant internal teams earlier today, the information is much appreciated! The Verge reached out to Bandai Namco with a request for comment but didn t immediately hear back. I recommend to download the blue sentinel mod, report this to the software devs, don't recommend dark souls to anyone and don't pre purchase Elden ring until Software takes this situation seriously.",0
Negative,"Good game, but is PLAGUED with hackers that teleport, force instant death animations, prevent you from using separation crystal (forcing you to force close the game) and in other cases completely wiping ALL of your progress That's right, a hacker can invade you and simply erase countless hours of progress from your character. They can also force actions on your character that makes the game detect you as a cheater, penalizing you and BANNING you from online forever even though you didn't do anything. While this hasn't happened to me there are plenty of cases of it happening. I cannot recommend the game until this is handled properly by FromSoftware.

Negative,"This is a fantastic game that I would recommend to everyone, if not for one thing:The state of online play. The game is plagued by hackers, capable of not only instantly killing other players, but corrupting their game files, or getting them banned by inserting invalid data into their account. With the ability to invade another player's game, encountering these cheaters isn't even something you have control over.

Negative,Way too hard for me. Lost my mind30 yo Boomer tho so I cant talk ill about the game. Its probably me issue,0
Negative,"This game is a very fun game, and I loved every second of it. However, FROM SOFT has ruined the game for me. 1. Softbaning. According to the anti-cheat software shoving its head up its ass I, and many, many other players, have been softbanned for no reason. CO-OP does not really exist for me any more, and apparently the invaders have given up on trying to get me as well. I'm basically playing a single player version of a multiplayer game because of some formatting error. On top of all that I deleted my main character because I thought it would fix the error message. So there goes 30 hours of my time, FROM, I hope you're happy. 2. Glitches. This game is riddled with glitches. Some of them allow enemies and other creatures to hop around the screen and attack you at lighning speed in seconds. It was not a framerate issue, it just happened for me. My game would sometimes give me delayed responces as well. Sometimes I would try to roll, but it would not happen. I did the most logical thing and tried to roll again, and I just ended up rolling twice. It was NOT a framerate issue. 3. Online Play. I'm not going to lie. My internet connection is not the best, but I get a decient ammount of bandwith that I have little to no trouble with playing other games in multiplayer mode. Most of, if not all, the games that I invaded orwas summoned into had Lagasaurous-Rex teir lag. Players would SLIDE across the screen in their idle position whilst making damaged gasps and attacking sounds. Enemies and BOSSES would revert to these stances whenever my host was attacked by them. It was incredably easy for me to backstab every enemy due to the extreme lag on FROM's servers. The worst part was the invaders and the bosses. Invaders would do the same thing as the host while attacking in their idle position. invasions turned into a spam fest because no one could tell what the others were doing. When bosses became like this I could not be damaged. I don't know if it was the fact that the boss was nowhere near me due to lag or the fact that an animation had to hit me to damage me. I don't know. However, the fact that this happened is outrageous for a game. Conclusion. Don't buy this game until it has been fixxed. Otherwise you may be banned for no reason, thus limiting the game, become frusterated when glitches ruin your fun, and generally become confused when everyone is in their freaking idle position.",0

Negative,"Great game just a real shame that hackers can force hacked items into your inventory thus getting you banned with no warning and no hope of getting it undone. Now this was already an issue and has been pretty much the whole lifetime of the game but recently Fromsoft/Namco Bandai removed the family and friends sharing option which was the only real defence you had for not getting your legit copy banned by sharing the game and playing it through a separate account so when/if you get banned though a third party acting maliciously you could still play the game as intended. (though it would normally cost you the current save as well up until your last manual backup assuming you though far enough ahead to manually back up your saves for an online game . . . )This only really harms legit players as hackers were already getting around the item checks and ban waves anyway and have been for a long time.Also, this means that anyone using legit mods (as in mods not made for cheating in PvP but changing the game itself adding more challenge e.c.t) now has a choice of playing the vanilla game as intended or using mods and catching a ban for doing so.This was a poor choice and really makes me think less of Fromsoft/Namco Bandai and makes me wonder if they will pull stuff like this further down the line with things like Elden ring.",0

Negative,"Edit: 5/5/2016 My review will be negative and it's gonna stay negative until From Software / BANDAI NAMCO adresses the issues allowing hackers to soft ban inocent players using the same lousy anti-cheat system it has proven to fail before, outdate and useless, until the wave of ppl softbanned STOP, i will NOT recommend this game to anyone and i will try to prevent ppl from buying this game until the anticheat system works properly.(Old Review)Today's Review: Dark Souls IIIOverview: Dark Souls III is the third delivery of the franchise (leaving aside Demon Souls) from the developer From Software for PC and consoles. This third (and supposed to be the last souls ever) boost overall what has been done in the past, for me at least raising the bar for fans and newcommers alike. Many will buy this game not fully getting that's basically a hardcore game, pretty much old school in the way that is meant to reward you for your hard efford, the game have 1 set difficulty and you will have to struggle, maybe coop with friends and try countless times until you get the grip of it, eventually you'll understand the mechanic of the game and you will die in ocations but in the end this is a really amazing journey within a story that i still don't fully understand, before i forget this is an Action RPG game, third person and for new ppl this is NOT something to take it lightly.First steps: At first when you start to understand what's an unkindled, a hallow, a lord of cinder, you will start playing a souls game, you will admire beautiful landscapes, amazing scenes while playing and cutscenes that are really well made until you get frustrated by being killed by any single enemy alone in the game, yet with perseverance comes strenght, you will succed if you keep trying, you will see the amazing many places this game have (tho linear, really restricted) and the amazing bosses and INCREDIBLE soundtrack, the gameplay for me was made to use a controller rather that the keyboard but that's up to you and one final thing, optimization has been done really good but the game's frames drops sometimes so it would be nice a patch to adress those issues.Final note: i have so much to say about the souls games and this one in particular, i might update this review later, for me this game it's a bit expensive at the moment but if you're looking for a challange then this is a great game. I'm happy i've got this one.Metascore: 82/100 ""Give it a try, if you don't mind losing your souls, unkindled one :)""",0

There is a serious exploit making the rounds online that lets hackers mess up your save game really bad and Bamco and FromSoftware have been made aware of it a long time ago and they have chosen not to patch it.

Negative,"I actually very much enjoy this game and wish for many others to play it even now. The only reason I give it a thumbs down is because ""From Software"" neglects the PC players tremendously. There's hackers still in pvp that not only can use normal cheats, but crash your game through animation spamming that overloads your framerate and even WORSE than that. they can put items that are bannable into your inventory such as ""20 Storm Rulers"". No weapon goes beyond +10, so when you log in, the game detects ""unusual data"" and automatically bans you from being able to play. From Software has nothing to combat this and will take quite a while to unban you assuming you even have proof.Aside from that, PVP in this game, while fun. is kinda past its prime. Everyone's been playing this game for years already, the community agreed level cap of 120 goes overrated because people will new game plus and setup areas that are invaded frequently to become these ""fight clubs"". It gets really annoying being an Aldritch Faithful covenant member wanting to PVP when someone's in the territory, only to find out they cleared every mob and have 3 friends with them that were pre-summoned level 900+'s just looking for an easy gank. It kinda exploits the system and makes any genuine fun you'd get out of intentional designs, a bit hit and miss. I love invading and being invaded, but the system is very easily exploitable and not well designed.The story won't make sense at all, even if you've played the other 2 dark souls since every NPC's dialogue is cryptic and written with assumed context of you knowing what's even happening. You WILL spend mountains of time googling everything, from story to content you missed because it's very poorly explained. which is a good thing and bad thing imo. It creates a more genuine RPG feel but neglects the player's ability to understand or displays rather bad ""conveyance"". How are you supposed to know its your responsibility to do even half the things the NPC's say when half of them are just rambling about what you should do but are not actually capable of right?It's still a really fun game and I'll still be playing it, but From Software needs to take this down vote and realize they need to add anti-cheat software when it comes to PC games. Not only that but the balance in this game is. very questionable as the META ruins a LOT of pvp encounters you may have and even some of the PVE.Something to add. The playerbase is mostly toxic and meme based. Every name you come across is a meme, no one plays this game like an actual RPG, they just read it like a math exam and name themselves one of the following.""bruh""dude""Something Racist + word""Praise the Insert Meme here""dddddddddd""12345678""Cosplay as anime or character in game""I'm not much against the last one but damn after a while this just gives you an actual headache when you realize everyone treats this game like it's made specifically for memes. I miss when RPG's actually enveloped players and they were immersed in the environment they were in over being able to wave their shield button 90 times and throw dung to imply ur ""bad"".",0
Negative,why the fuck this game does not have a cloud system on saves.,0
Negative,"I have to say, genuinely, this is such a good game, and DS3 is the most quality version in PC platform.However, I hope I am not the only one who wants to critisie its file checking system, which results in so many true fans of DS3 got soft banned or even permenantly banned.Why? Because so many cheaters not only happy with editing their own files but also want to do so to others. They are able to use such as CE to craft a weapon which is not belong to the game, and this kind of weapon can achieve consequences like one-shot kill or 'back to level-1'. This very negative phenomenon causes many legal players banned by the system mentioned above when it identifies any 'invalid' date in their own files.What makes me even angry is, the game operators do not give a shit about it, especially for the customers in PC. They even stated that this is only our faults to 'play with' or 'recieve gifts from' thoes inappropiate players. However, could you plz tell me how can I avoid being invaded by these players? How can I know they are the ones? Someone might argue that YOU CAN JUST TRUN OFF THE ON-LINE PLAY OPTION. Yes, I can, if the online content is optional, I would rather ask a refund for castrating this content off.To sum up, if you really love this game and you like pvp and/or any other online game-plays, PC VERSION IS THE LAST OPTION.",0
Negative,This is a great game but the online dueling community is swarmed with hackers that will make your account get banned. I talked to support any they told me there is nothing they can do to unban my account because the main company is based in Japan. Very unfortunate that this amazing game is getting gutted by hackers on pc with no fix in site. If you must play this game I recommend offline but most of the content is made for online so you will feel lonely and like you are playing an incomplete game.Really hope Elden ring doesn't do the same auto ban system.Hackers are able to fill your character up with hacked items once you join their world. And even if you delete them right away you will still be flagged and banned.,0

Negative,"Honestly, I'm not a big fan of Dark Souls III. Truth be told, I kinda hate it. I'll say now that most of this is probably personal bias.To me, this game feels a lot more artifically harder than it needs to be. The lack of any hitstun from just wearing armour can be bloody unbearable sometimes, like when some tosser hits you with a knife and your guy staggers as if he just got hit by a bloody bomb while wearing full metal plated armour. And yeah, there are hyper frames when you swing with Great/Ultra Great weapons, I know.The melee combat is fine, obviously. It's a souls game, simple if you just boil it down to it's basics which would be ""press circle/b when bad man swings, press r1 to hit when bad man no swing"" just like the other games. The spell casting is different this time around, and I kinda enjoy it. It's probably one of the few reasons why I occasionally revisit this game. I find a fair amount of enjoyment rolling around a boss and throwing a massive orb of fire in their face, or slamming a lightning stake right into the feet whenever I get the moment to.The progression isn't too bad, I suppose? Upgrade Materials are fed out at a reasonable rate, though I dislike how rare infusion gems are. You get like what, one lightning gem the entire game unless you're willing to farm Lothric Knights? Good luck with that though. There doesn't seem to be many options early/mid game, either. The game might be a little rough early game if you pick a caster as a starting class, and dear lord pyromancer starts off with some awful stats which is fair enough I suppose since they also start off with pyromancy and high faith/int.The weapon arts are also new, kinda. Every weapon has some kinda gimmick attached to it that you can use when two handing, many straight swords have a Stance that allows you to break guards if you land the hit or close the distance with a lunge, some weapons can buff themselves, and some weapons have completely unique weapon arts. Weaponarts use FP, and to restore that you'll mostly be using Ashen Estus to restore that and you'll have to carefully balance what amount of Estus you convert into Ashen Estus to use both weapon arts and spells which is fair enough I suppose. Spells can demolish bosses pretty quick so you'll have to give up some healing to kill em with just spells, so carrying 20 soul spears and 20 estus (exaggeration, but still.)I don't really know what else to say, to be honest. It's a decent game I guess but I still kinda hate it. Maybe it's just not what I'd expect from a souls game or maybe I'm just awful. So maybe you'll like it, maybe you won't. Just keep in mind it is difficult at times and, in my opinion, it feels ""Hard"" for the sake of being ""Hard"" rather than challenging.And dear GOD the first DLC is bloody dreadful. It's short, some of the enemy encounters are just outright unfair and awful. DLC2 is. eh, I didn't like it. I suppose it's just more dark souls 3, really. Though it did have one boss I enjoyed, who was Gael. He's a pretty good fight and I had a lot of fun with that boss.",0
Negative,Fix the damn servers.,0
Negative,"Dark Souls 3 is a pretty decent single player game.The enemies are varied, the boss fights are engaging, the level design is great. I prefer Dark Souls 1 level design in particular, however, because teleporting was not an option until much later in the game; it made you feel like you were truly exploring the world, and everything was connected. Comparatively, you are now required to teleport to get to the first actual level in this game, and to subsequent levels. Teleporting was very seldom a requirement in Dark Souls 1.The way multiplayer/PVP is balanced is horrid.Sure, co-op with friends is good. Just as it always has been in the Souls series, when you look at the co-op aspect by itself. However there is a major problem. Now more than ever in this game series, invaders are urged to twink (at lower levels). Here's why: 99% of the time, invaders are matched with players who already have co-op phantoms in their world. Yes, the invading system favors hosts who already have their buddies with them, ready to gank your invading ass back to your world. Coupled with the covenant system where blue defenders can show up and gank you even harder, it's no wonder why invaders twink. They have to twink in order to win. And when these twink players invade a player and his friend who are playing normally, with no upgraded equipment and early-game gear, they become casualities to this idiotic system.When it comes to PVP at higher levels. Well, let's just say it's not fun. Since there is no poise as we're used to from DS1 (and to a lesser extent 2), and since shields are pretty useless except for a very small percentage, PVP is a roll-fest. Have full Havel's on? Prepare to get stunned by bare fists. You wanna use a shield below a greatshield? You better be ready to become a parry king through guesswork, or get shield broken and take repost damage. By the way, when it comes to armor, heavy and light are now not viable. The only truly optimal armor to wear is medium. It provides the best amount of defense in the game for the least amount of weight. Miyazaki got the title wrong, this should have been named Bloodborne 2.I say that because it's a game completely focused on dodging. You are encouraged to dodge, and that idea is exemplified by the fact that you basically have fast rolls until 70% weight ratio. Rolling is simply absurdly over powered and is essentially a core gameplay aspect. Regarding shields, all but greatshields are useless. All parry options now have a windup before the actual parrying window starts, and combined with the fact that attacks from enemies are much faster than in DS1, it's much harder to parry on reaction, if not impossible.Overall,I'd say if you want to play the newest Dark Souls game simply for the sake of it being a part of the Souls' series, do it. But if you're going to be playing, be prepared for what I have described.",0

Negative,"Dark Souls III is one of those few games that I love dearly, but can t recommend to everyone because of a number of different issues that bring the experience down. Fans of the series can possibly interpret my review as an overall positive experience, but new folks will need to consider the game more carefully. Hopefully, some of my gripes have already been addressed by developers. Let s begin with the performance.Dark Souls 3 continues the tradition of having areas that drop frames. It was a mostly stable 60fps experience for me, but dropping frames didn t do me any favors when I was carefully timing my movements. The frame drops weren t restricted to one area either. I had this problem over the entire course of the game. Some areas in the later portion of the game were really horrid. What also made me really sour was whenever I lost connection to their servers, I d be booted back to the title screen instead of just going into offline mode. I ve seen this happen during a boss fight. I also had a few crashes, but they were rare enough to not be a serious problem. Finally, I joined a significant number of other players worlds as a friendly phantom only to not be able to enter the boss s fog door. For reference, I am using a GTX 970 and an i7 4790K with 8 GBs of RAM and Windows 7.The combat in the game is very familiar if you ve played the previous games, but the weapon variety and weapon skills help spice things up. Wielding a weapon with both hands lets you use its weapon skill which can be anything from a special parry, firing three arrows rapidly, summoning lightning, having a new strong attack combo, a quickstep, or even giving yourself a temporary attack buff. Having more tools to handle a situation is a plus in my book and this game s implementation of it gives melee players an incentive to put the shield away. Weapon skills being available on every single weapon made combat feel much more entertaining, especially when the boss weapons have some of the boss techniques on them. I didn t engage much with spellcasting since I heard it required a lot of specialization. Pyromancy is still very accessible for characters, powerful, and looks great. The magic buffs in general are also well worth the effort to acquire for melee characters.However, the combat has significant flaws. Poise doesn t do what you would expect. Poise didn t keep me from being staggered by attacks and no matter how much poise I stacked, even the weakest hollows could stagger me without much effort. Because of how poise works in this game, heavy armor doesn t feel like it s protecting you as much since stun locks can still happen. I believe some spells and definitely some weapon skills can increase your poise to prevent stagger to allow uninterrupted attacks. For example, the Black Knight Sword has a skill called Perseverance which says Raise sword to temporarily boost poise. Damage reduced while activated. When this skill is used, you can avoid any staggering effects and attack without restraint. Notice how it says it s raising poise, yet any poise gained from any wearable equipment cannot avoid being staggered. They should have renamed the stat because of how confusing and misleading it is to have two different kinds of poise with very different effects. From what I read, regular poise has to do with vulnerability frames (not i-frames) with rolling. I suppose that s what they want from players, more rolling.The second major problem with combat is how the walls interact with players and enemies. You ll soon discover that as you try to attack through a solid object, you ll recoil from the impact. This recoil can occur when fighting near pillars or walls and makes sense when it happens. You don't have Kitty Pryde's phasing abilities. On the other hand, enemy attacks will ignore walls and strike you for full damage. I ve only seen enemy phantoms and two very large enemies recoil from trying to attack through walls or objects. One of those large enemies threw a chain axe through about 14 feet of wall and managed to hit me. There were far too many instances where enemies could attack through extremely thick walls or obstacles and still hurt you. I wanted tough, but fair, not this nonsense. I ve even seen some enemies shoot projectiles through walls. I don t understand why enemies are allowed to ignore solid matter to such a degree. I don t remember if the other games had this enemy behavior, but it s really obvious in this installment. At least the boss combat is pretty good.The boss fights in DSIII are very well paced and are much more memorable than DSII. There are less bosses which appears to have resulted in higher quality fights with unique and interesting movesets. The overly humanoid setup of DSII didn t make a comeback for this title. I enjoyed most of the fights and found myself pleasantly surprised at what the bosses brought to the table. Sometimes, the fights can change in a way that I ll not spoil here. I liked how they were designed, both mechanically and visually.Speaking of visuals, Dark Souls III is the best looking one in the series. It s a gorgeous game with gorgeous views. The environments also tie together pretty well. You can t exactly travel to all the places by foot, but if you can see it, you can probably go there. I greatly enjoyed how you can constantly see places that you ve been to in the background which gives a good sense of progress and where you are in the world. Seeing what s up ahead and thinking Oh man, do I get to go there too? is another thing that DSIII does very well. Here s an example of what I mean from very, very early in the game:I d also like to point out that there s no impossible elevator la Dark Souls II.Multiplayer is fairly pleasant, but From Software s approach to handling cheaters doesn t seem like the best approach, mostly because of how the innocent are soft-banned along with the guilty. Be sure to never, ever accept an item from a stranger, but unfortunately, sometimes that may not even be enough. In addition to that issue, some of the covenants have difficulty finding hosts. The game s matchmaking seems too restrictive which doesn t make sense since it s capable of scaling players down to the host s level. If you go and reach a high level with a character, be prepared to have a really difficult time reaching certain covenant ranks. The password matchmaking is quite good and allows friends to easily play with other friends. Just make sure you both spell the password exactly the same. I spent a large portion of my time engaging in jolly cooperation. I also did deliberate pvp which was also a good deal of fun. The multiplayer functions mostly and it s fun, but it carries the risk of contracting a digital STD. No one wants to be soft-banned unjustly. Yeesh.Whew, here are some other things that affected my time with DSIII: I ve seen my friendly phantoms die to an invader after I finished watching a boss intro cutscene, the patch notes for this game are vague to the point of being almost useless, the camera will sometimes work against you if you re too close to a wall, and the game has plenty of nods to the previous titles that sometimes turn into full body spasms.I really enjoyed Dark Souls 3, but hoo boy did I also grow frustrated with the game. I uninstalled and reinstalled it several times before finally keeping it uninstalled. I just grew tired of the problems it has, but I do acknowledge that there s still a great game in there to be experienced. It s just a darn shame that they went with the decisions they did that prevent the game from reaching its full potential. I was almost done with NG+ too. If you can look past its issues, prepare to buy.",0
Negative,"Let me Preface with thisI am a huge fan of Dark Souls and Bloodborne, (I've sunk well over 1k hours into each) I have played the second DS and didn't like it (Big suprise) and was looking forward to this one with optimisim and was hugely dissappointed Dark Souls 3 Is unbalancedI feel as if I am playing an early build where tweaking and rebalancing is in its early stages,Keep in mindI have multiple max all stat (all 99) characters I went to NG+9 and invested many hours into this game(Note I do not have very much PVP experience but I do have some. I am mostly reffering to Offline play in this review)1) Poise is non existant and worthless.Poise was a major factor in combat in DS 1. It allowed you to take hits without being staggered; if you had a high enough poise value. This allowed you to effectively trade blows with Mobs and Players. You could initiate an attack and not be staggered during the animation. Hyper armor is present in DS3 but it's situational at best. This leads to stunlock gameplay. The best/ultimate/only viable strategy for PvE is to equip all light armor and a weapon with good range and wide sweeping attacks to stagger every enemy in the vacinity and stun lock all of them. I.E. in the Boreal valley I used all light armor and the Wolf knight Great Sword to stagger ever enemy encounter before they staggered me and I got through the area unscathed. However if I tried to use heavier armor and trade blows I would loose everytime. So why bother using heavy armor at all? This brings up two more issues. Sheilds being useless, and enemy aggression/overall combat pacing.2)Shields. Sheilds have alway been a very usefull offensive and defensive item in previous souls games. The ability to throw up a shield and block an attack was invaluable. Enemy's blows could bounce off your shield and staggr your opponent creating an opening for you. Depending on the sheild taking a blow would not consume much stamina. However in DS3 I was onlyable to take 2 or 3 hits before my gaurd was broken on most normal sheilds. Thiswouldn't be a problem if the enemies werent so aggressive, but more on thatlater. The offensive side to sheilds in previous souls games in the Parry/Riposte Mechanic which also suffers in this game. I mastered Parrying in DS1 and as a result I could combat most enemies no problem. However in this game the parrying is almost entirely luck based. Enemies swing so quickly parrying is very difficult to perform. Especially when enemies have multi hit combos. Combined with the lack of poise and the stamina cosumed in blocking, screwing up a parry can cost you a fight. Great sheilds are also usless. They too consume a great amount of stamina when blocking attacks leading to frequent guard breaks. 3) Enemy AggressionThis is more of a personal opinion but I feel it still holds weight. Enemies are much more aggressive than they have ever been in a souls game. many enemies have multihit combos that result in the player being stunlocked due to the lack of poise. blocking does not help because your guard breaks easily. Rolling is the only efficient method to combat. Armor and sheilds are way to underpowered to deal with the aggressive enemies of DS3All of these issues lead to only one viable playstyle. Light rolling, and heavy weapons. Using Heavy armor is pointless as it yields no benefit. Shields can only block a few attacks at best before your guard is broken so why bother with them. The lack of poise leads to a stunlock gameplay. It feels as if I am playing bloodborne with a Souls skin. From should have made another bloodborne since they obviously wanted to4)Map designWhat is porbably my favorite design feature of DS 1 was the intricate map design. The waps were wooven together vertically which allowed for shortcuts and hidden passage ways. it was really interesting to explore the map and see how it folded back in on itself and how it flowed. Just the oter day I was playing DS 1 through again and I noticed that you can see Lost Izalith from the Tomb of The Giants bonfire. It made the map feel titly knit and jammed packed. Being forced to explore the map and every nook and cranny due to the inability to fast travel early on made me very familliar with themap. I now have it memorizeed like the back of my hand and can navigate it very quickly. However DS3 is rather linear. The map doesnt come together and suprise you like DS1 did. Its not a major issue I'm Just dissappointed slightly5) Hub WorldDS2 and 3 adopted a HUB approach to the game design. they forced you to return to a certain area to level up, upgrade weapons, and to purchase items. While in DS3 merchants, blacksmiths, andbonfires were all over the map. You could all your weapon upgrading, repairs, and leveling up from any bonfire. This allowed the game to flow and didnt interupt the exploration at all. Instead of warping back to a HUB and going through multiple loading screens just to level up I could instead do it all at a bonfire. This made my journey feel much more personal and lonely which really helped deliever the atmosphere of lonliness that Dark Souls nailed perfectly.The game does have some pluses however. It is visually stunning Some of the bossfights are fantastice. The music is top notchPvP from what I played is reasonably fun despite the many balancing issuesThe enviorments, while linear, are gorgeous and intterestingIt has interesting endingsthe Quests are fun and rewardingVoice acting is stellar",0

Even the complete removal of all game data after receiving the warning, was no guarantee that you wouldn't get penalised (by design, FROM claims, and contrary to everything the ""warning"" message said or implied.) While I had fun exploring and collecting everything, I have absolutely no desire to do it again. Since, let's face it, this game isn't all that deep once you have seen everything at least once before. The NG+ cycles are uninspired and unchanging. PVP is the real endgame and I'm barred from it as I write this. I wouldn t have bothered if rebirth wasn't a thing, if having a character with all gear to choose from didn't have a tangible benefit. Which is another gripe I have with the game (only 5 rebirths per cycle, no forgoing of SLs, you can't re-roll the starting class) but that is another issue, and one I would begrudgingly accept if everything else worked as it should. Which currently it doesn't.Get your shit together FROM. This is just disgraceful. Update 2016-05-02: Do not bother with Bandai Namco support. I finally got a reply out of them, after a few emails. It was a generic, canned reply saying that I should be patient. Yes, I am patient. Very patient. You have to be, if you are forced to do PVP on the shadow server. Talk about adding insult to injury.Update 2016-05-09: I opened a ticket to see if that works better than email. I linked this review and received a reply within 24 hours, asking me several questions. I answered the questions, but nothing has happened since then.Update 2016-05-13: I don't even care anymore. Praise Steam Family Sharing.Update 2016-05-17: Put in an edit about the warning/ban system as some new information has surfaced. FROM claims that the review system it is working now and that mistakes made previously will be rectified. We shall see.",0

Negative,"At the time of posting this, the cheating that's going on it this game is still an issue. Both valve(I understand they don't have to) and fromSoft refuse to do anything about the cheaters who have been running around in this game. Having put in a ticket with both steam and bamco about this I basically got a whole lot of f*uck you in response. Cheats since last I played outside of 5 mins ago to see if anything changed(well over a month ago at this point) fake phantoms that serve as dmg sponges, the usual infinite health/stamina, and the most annoying of all being one that will actually get you softbanned by fromSoft. These are still a thing. What makes it so bad was that these cheats started popping up around 2 or so weeks after the game came out. The rest of this review is based on my own personal feelings as someone who has played as sorcery based classes since demon souls. As for the actual gameplay my major complaint, besides enemies following the tired formula of have infiite stamina to bash you with, is how bad sorcery has it this time around. No one was asking for from to make the game easy for us(don't understand how it ever was. Dodging skills were a must in agressive boss fights and pvp). However with 90% of the bosses in this game being aggressive and spells damage being nerfed hard, it makes boss fight needlessly difficult and maybe even a little unfair. Playing as melee, Spell damage has been given really odd base requirements before the it become decent. Starting at 60 int is where you'll start to see the damage accel at. Keep in mind that in previous souls game you maxed out at 60 if you were hardcore sorcery otherwise 50 was perfectly fine at you're still dangerous. Remember how soul spear and the crystal spells(bar homing crystal in dks1) were good? Yeah not so much in this game. Incredibly slow and in most cases outclassed by the arrow spells. I started the game as a spellsword thanks to some people on reddit I was able to see just how jacked sorcery really was. To start my Dex was 25 and int 15 with base class being merc. Casting magic weapon wields an extra 50 points of dmg at best. I don't remember these results in the first 2 games. In DK1 with mild point allocation I remember seeing around 100 points of extra damage on an unupgraded weapon. In this game I deal with one swing 200~210 per swing on a normal enemy with a +3 Uchi. Respec to 31 dex and 21 int damage went from 263 to 290 with magic weapon. This was done as apparently you don't see minor returns on int until at least 20. So that's my opinion on this game from a spell slinger pov. I wanted to love this game. Really I did. But I have completely lost faith in from's ability to make an anti-cheat system that's worth a damn and that sorcery will stop being completely eclipsed by other styles of play.",0
Negative,"This game was fun until someone else put modded gear into my inventory and now I have restricted gameplay.If you buy this, keep a backup of your saved game files, or play offline only.Don't expect any support from bandai from hackers that get to keep ruining the game for other people.*Update* Bandai has now told me that I should keep a backup saved game file (which I did) in order to restore my game in case of another player using hacks.However, I have now been flagged because my level changed too quickly for their anti-cheat system.*Update* Bandai has removed the ban, but there is always a chance of the same thing happening again and I receive the perm ban.They disabled family share so you have to buy a second copy once that happens.I would not buy this game until they have a better system for hacking or they remove the anti-cheat all-together.Broken anti-cheat system and broken support for the game.",0
Negative,"This negative review is solely about my experience on a PC. If you plan on buying this for PC beware the game is designed for console use and the user interface reflects that, a lot. All hints are given in a console style, LB + A for example. Every time some tutorial command popped up I eneded up having to go the menu (also designed for console use imo) to cross reference the command given versus the keyboard command. So theres some frustration and confusion right off the bat. Had to google how to jump and kick and I still havent figured out kick yet. Needs more cross platform support, maybe an option to map kick to a key. Other than that the game is spectacular, combat is smooth and realistic, and playing in the dark with head phones is downright scary and I'm a grown 40 year old man. I bought it on sale for $25, honestly I'd be a little hot if I paid the full $60, probably would've returned it. Make it a little more PC friendly and I'll happilly change this to a thumbs up. Thanks!",0
Negative,"There is an exploit in the game which can be used by hackers to manipulate the save game (and possibly others files on that persons computers) of someone through invasion/summoning.

No idea if Fromsoft is going to do anything about the cheating at this point.Addendum: If you are only interested in SP and don't care about online features then the game is fine.TLDR(for commenters with comprehension problems): I like the game, but cheaters ruin a fun portion of the game and Fromsoft doesn't seem to be doing anything about it.

Negative,"I finally get to join the illustrious club of ""negative review after hundreds of hours of gameplay"". Despite enjoying myself at game launch for these many hundreds of hours playing the active PVP, I cannot recommend this game. Dark Souls 3 is a game that lacks soul, ironically. It's very polished, and I can't even really call it bad. but it never really tries to excel anywhere or experiment in any other ways that the previous games experimented. The story is a basic chosen one tale that just has you do the same thing that you've done in the other two games again but while being obsessed with self-reference (OMG look it's that thing from Dark Souls 1) and with none of the nuance of the previous titles or any attempt to try anything really new. Where Dark Souls 1 shrouds its story in a fallible myth that the player may not even discover the cracks in and where Dark Souls 2 tries to depict a new world built on the ashes of the old one struggling with themes of memory, identity, and loss, Dark Souls 3 tries nothing. It just falls back really hard on the key imagery of previous games (mostly Dark Souls 1 because the game really wants to tap into your nostalgia) without any of the other unique things that made that imagery work. The whole world is structured completely around the cycle of the first flame repeating for the millionth time and the importance of you as the Ashen One and nothing really questions it any significant way. Most of the NPCs are happy to be shopkeepers for you for the entirety of the game and don't really have anything interesting going on with them. The lore is a vague and sometimes jumbled up mess thanks to a rearrangement of content during the development cycle that is somehow even more incoherent then Dark Souls 2 which had a way worse development cycle. There's not really any theme other than decay and even that is not really explored in any meaningful way or employed beyond being set dressing. The alternate story paths provided by the game don't have any depth and yet again rely on imagery that has already been used more effectively in previous titles.The combat and visuals have improved compared to previous entries, but they both suffer from varying levels of blandness. The visual fidelity of the game is much greater than the last two Souls games, and there's great detail put into both the textures and the actual level geometry. Despite that, many places have a very limited color palette with washed out or gray colors, and it's common to find tombstones and corpses absolutely everywhere or giant piles of ash and dust, to an absurd point. There are still very stunning vistas that will drop your jaw, but everything kind of blurs together during the actual playthrough of the level. The combat is a lot faster than previous entries, and enemies and bosses alike are well animated and have a sometimes surprisingly large repertoire of beautiful or intimidating moves. This is especially true of the boss fights, which steal the show with their incredible visuals and good movesets, marking them as some of the best boss fights they've ever made. While the combat has sped up in the boss fights have improved tremendously in both presentation and in difficulty, it all lacks real depth. Stamina management and rolling are easier than ever in this game, making combat often boil down to roll at kind of the right time and then press r1 or cast a spell. This greatly diminishes the impact of the boss fights especially and reduces many of them to surprisingly lenient reaction time tests. Not all of the bosses suffer from this; some of the bosses towards the end of the main game and all of the DLC bosses start to use moves that are structured or delayed in a way to catch panic rolls or rolls that were timed to initial movement and not the actual swing. That is really as deep as it gets though. The actual level design is okay, but it lacks the intricacy of Dark Souls 1 or Bloodborne. Levels often are very linear with few branching paths, and the level to level exploration follows suit. This is the most linear entry in the series, and every diverging path is just a fork whose other path ends pretty quickly. These diverging paths also never really interconnect, meaning that when you're done it's just back to the main path or to the other path. Levels themselves and level to level exploration boils down to holding forward into the boss and then repeating that past the boss until you can no longer hold forward. It's not devoid of interesting things; there are a few interesting secret levels in the game. But most of the game playing is just finding the obvious path forward and then holding to it. The two things that I can say are really good are the music and the second DLC. The music is emotional, epic, and beautiful. There's not a bad track in the whole soundtrack, and all the songs are beautifully composed and performed to capture and enhance the mood of the boss with which they're paired. The second DLC has the most varied and expansive visuals and level design in the whole game, and as a whole homages the previous entries in the Souls series without the cloying, empty, and uncritical nostalgia of the references in the main game. Great bosses, great music, great levels, and the best Patches arc in all the games! Dark Souls 3 is a game that is far too safe. It seems deeply afraid to experiment or to truly do anything exceptional. All it seems interested in doing is being a medieval knight game with the same imagery as the previous entries in the series. I guess in that regard you can consider the game a success. But as the final entry in a series that has made its name through experimentation with how it presents its story, its themes, and the player's relationship to the world, it fails to really do anything but be a decent action title. If that's all you're here for, you'll probably like Dark Souls 3. But if you want anything that the previous entries experimented with or want a truly deep action experience, look elsewhere.",0

Negative,"OMFG i cannot express just how mad the community for this game makes me. i have never in my life met such hatefull hackers and counter hackers EVER. let me put in better perception my experience with this trash heep of a game's community.so originally i had owned this game for PS3 and thought to myself after 100s of hours wow this game would be awesome if it could be modded so i had bought it for PC and knew nothing of the ban system (as a side note OMFG why DOES THIS GAME BAN PEOPLE SO EASILY BUT NEVER TOUCHES THE GRIEFFING HACKERS WTF) instantly i get in the game alter my stats so pretty much go through the game in a day because i was not there for the base game i was there for the modding of the game. tues comes around and in the same instant i modded my stats i get banned :/ ""ok no worries i clearly caused it"". so i learn about family share ""nice"" make a new account beat the game legit this time and start looking up whats ""bannable"" and whats not during this time i see a few videos around about peoples homemade boss characters and think wow that would be Amazing!, So i make one myself do a few matches in a high PvP area get all around well reception :3. But then the salty hackers comes online. I had decided to do a role play in the ringed city where i was the ""Void Lord"" causally strolling through the city with my phantoms acting as my royal guard. now as a side note i want to point out how much work it is to change anything in the game EVERY EFFECT AND EVERY CHANGE MUST BE MANUALLY IMPUTED EVERY TIME YOU LAUNCH THE GAME this takes hours my fastest time being two hours of raw data setting. i start my walk through the city not hiding that the ""hacks"" are in place i also want to point out that my ""boss""character does not fight and is very beatable not broken just flashy. but no a hacker who's character name is end see this as cheating breaks the role play invades me and insta curses me. Not only does he do this once but keeps invading just to insta curse. ""but Stormy"" you say ""you were hacking you deserve this"" i was trying to host a fun little role play not break the PvP element to the game. so i think to myself ""ok this dude is the only one its a bad day to do this"" log off and try again tomorrow.so again i get problems i log on the next day everyone plays along the invaders if have fun AS THE WHOLE THING WAS SUPPOSED TO BE. but then i find out that one of the players not only hacks items into the account to ban it but he also HACKS THE FAMILY SHARE ACCOUNT TO FORCEFULLY DISABLE THE FAMILY SHARE ON THE GAME.so yes if you ask is the game worth it on PC HELL NO! the publisher is to ignorant to figure out how to appropriately make a proper ban system and allows constant griefers to run rampant in the game.",0

Negative,"I have never written a review a day in my life. But after seeing the recent news that family sharing was cut to prevent ""cheaters"" from playing on the official servers I believe the developer is just slapping us consumers because they couldn't figure out how to fix their own product. I love this game, love everything about it and how it makes me want to fling my controller at the screen. However, when a company gives little regard for people affected by hackers and just throws out one blanket ban after another to try and solve the problem they hurt the people that are trolled by hackers. It says something where a majority of the players (excluding new comers to the franchise) are in one sense or another banned, most of the time for doing nothing wrong apart from being hacked and reported by the hacker. Because yes, I have the technological know how to add a +1000 damage ring to my inventory when I barely can figure out how to work my smart phone these days. If you love this franchise by all means get it, but do not be surprised when you either get hit by a hacker and banned or are unable to find anyone to summon because most players are not on official servers anymore. (And most of them would never pay full price to get the game on a new account just to get banned again in a few days) I hate writing a negative review about a franchise I would play until the end of time, but it was something that had to be said for those who were wrongfully removed. (I am not alone in this belief, search the internet and you will find many a story already published on how this change will damage the player base with people even saying that its better to be banned so you dont need to worry about it anymore.)",0

The Covenants were made easier to switch between as you can just ""equip"" them but are even less interesting and have some design flaws (Like Blue Sentinels and Darkmoon basically being the same thing).The world design is much more linear now, while not a concern of mine, it can be for a lot of people.Anti-cheat is basically non-existent and is a joke.

Negative,"I know a lot of people are in love with the series but it just isn't fun for me. There's a thin line between hard and frustrating and this game is just frustrating. There's no sense of accomplishment after a hard area, there's only relief. All games should have difficulty options and I don't care what so called elitists kids say. These developers do not care and they ignore a huge number of potential buyers. Do they realize there are older gamers? People who are just bad at fast games? Or even handicapped gamers? Nope, these people are not allowed to play this. Easy mode wouldn't hurt ANYONE, it only would make some people happy.Why play it then if you don't like it you ask? Well, this game has amazing atmosphere, lore, music and wonderful artstyle so you know, just maybe people want to play it for these things? But the whole series is marketed as insanely difficult games and this creates toxic elitist community on top.I've got this from Humble bundle after playing Dark Souls 2. I managed to finish that one somehow and DS3 looked prettier and had much better level design, overall look and mood so I thought why not? I'll activate my key. And then the frustration started. I had absolutely zero fun with this. All those things I mentioned like lore, atmosphere, music, I forgot about them after couple of hours and stopped caring about them because frustration makes it impossible to pay attention to.So what is DS3? It's a third person action game with rpg elements and barely any story (I want to notice that story doesn't equal lore, the latter is great, or maybe i should say the story-telling sisn't good). You just run through the levels while fighting extremely cheap and overpowered enemies. They always have more health, no stamina system, they hit harder than you and they often ambush you and put you into an impossible situations.Basically there are few types of enemies only. They have different textures but they all have same moves and patterns. Worst thing is that if you die you must go through the level again. Unlike in DS2 you can't get rid of enemies here. Another stupid decision. DS2 was at least playable because of that.Bosses are pretty boring. Their visual design is awesome but the whole fighting is boring as hell. Bosses have few moves and just repeat them over and over again. Compare it to Monster Hunter and DS bosses feel like they were made with zero effort. Hey just put this huge boss there, give him insane amount of hp and strength and be done with it . It's just cheap lazy design. Cheap ambushes, cheap enemies, cheap bosses (which actually are easier than regular enemies).Controls are ok'ish. It's janky and unresponsive. You can easily fall, your inputs have intentional delay to make it harder to react. Rolling doesn't work half of the time. Shield should help huh? Nope. Shields worked as intended in DS2, but here shields barely help. You don't have any special moves or skills, can't even jump, you only need to press the button at the right time, 0,1 seconds too early or too late and you get hit and get caught in a series of non-stop attacks.I'm not sure what the story is about because it's way too hard to follow it when you get 30 seconds of story and then 10 hours of frustrating combat. That makes you forget what npc said and you forget what are you doing there in general.You think maybe you can farm/grind and level up like in normal game as Final Fantasy and make it easier or harder depending on how much you grind. Nope. Leveling up makes little difference. Instead of losing 40% of hp from one hit you lose 38%.One more downgrade comparing to DS2 is that you can't restore your health as many times as you want. Overall DS2 was a better game, not as pretty but it was balanced at least to some degree while DS3 is poorly balanced where nothing matters except your reaction time and ability to predict enemy moves.It has really dark and grim atmosphere which is stunning. It's rare for games to have such an amazing atmosphere, another one which pops into my mind is Stalker (another game I did not enjoy at all). That is accompanied by great soundtrack which transitions into epic music when fighting the bosses.There's also always online function which makes the game even harder. Other players can invade you and kill you. Another amazing useless feature. At least you can turn off invasions here but then you lose online features which helps sometimes a little.Graphically it looks average. Artistic style is amazing along with level design. Both environments and enemy visual design is amazing. But graphics in general aren't very good. The game is quite blurry, it lacks graphical options, locked to 60fps and has no native ultrawide support. These developers clearly do not care about user experience.Yes I know for those who are extremely good at action games this could be fun, but its not for me. Games should bring joy to you, entertainment, having good time etc. And this only induce stress, negative stress which overshadows all the amazing things this game has. This game is nearly impossible for me and I only feel frustration. Maybe i'll finish it someday if someone helps me out, otherwise I think I will never finish it. But i'm sure i'm gonna ignore all the souls-like games unless it's safe to use cheats.ProsGreat atmosphereGreat soundtrackGreat artstyleGood loreConsJanky controlsCheating, op, cheap AIFull of of cheap deathsWay too difficult for normal peopleNo out of the box ultrawide supportLocked to 60fpsBoring combatBoring bossesFrustrating gameplay which becomes tediousLeveling up makes little differenceToo repetitive",0
Negative,"As of today you cannot play this game with family share, they removed this option. A friend got banned a second time god knows why, he did not mod or cheat (first one was because of a mod, his mistake) and now he can not play online because they will not un-ban him.If they remove the option to play from family share, at least remove the rule of the second permanent ban, otherwise he will have to buy the game again for something he did not do.",0

Negative,"Multiplayer shut down, save file corrupted.",0
Negative,"Generally good.But downvote because:- Camera/lock-on is unexpectedly worse than DSII, which is already bad enough.- The way they handle hack/cheat issue.",0
Negative,"I'd to expand on my previous review, especially with the point about anti-cheat. With the amount of money-grabbing, anti-cheat related shit and dumbing down on game mechanics, I can't give this or Dark Souls 1 demastered a positive rating anymore. As what is most likely the last in the Dark Souls franchise, my experience with Dark Souls 3 surpasses that of its predecessors. Soul Level Matchmaking is back, with an anti-twink measure (weapon reinforcement). Multiplayer is made way easier with password matchmaking too. (Thank goodness Soul Memory is gone.)The characters, lore, questlines, bosses are quite a massive improvement from DS1 and especially DS2, with all bosses having at least 2 phases and interesting backstories. Weapon movesets are rather varied, especially with the introduction of Battle Arts. Armor upgrades are gone but that means more Fashion Souls! It's also very nice to see customization options improved such as Character Creation and Optional Manual Attack Aiming.They should really work on the Poise system though, as stunlocking by Estocs and Straight Swords (Dark Sword) is. is. sigh. Phantom range is not as bad as DS2, but it happens sometimes due to bad connections on top of weapons like estoc and katanas. As for fanservice, of course there will be, but it is acceptable. (cough cough DS2 Old Dragonslayer cough cough) However, one thing that must be fixed in the softban issue. Many players falsely flagged as hacking/cheating, restricting online play. Luckily, it seems that the devs/publishers are actually doing something about it, albeit slow. All in all, Dark Souls 3 is a game well worth its asking price. Even new players to the franchise should pick it up if they can as it will provide them an exprience no other game can ever give. To players struggling with the game, I have this to say, ""Don't give up, skeleton!""",0
Negative,"This game comes with a neat feature. If you experience a power outtage or even a BSOD caused by the game, the anticheat built into the game will automatically corrupt your save file.You lose everything. This blind retribution is invasive and unreasonable in its emboldened action of corrupting data on the consumer's PC.If they had banned me from online multiplayer, I could have still completed the game. Instead I lose my time spent and am told I need to start over from scratch due to the developer/publisher's poor judgement.The first 80 hours were from the first playthrough. The game was not as fun the second time. Might just be that I have eidetic memory, but the mystery and confusion that the game series is known for was gone and it did not feel rewarding to complete it all the second time. I had made it to Lothric Castle the first playthrough (the one that was corrupted), completed all DLC as well, and I had that much of the game to replay just to get a sense of the ending,After playing all 3 Dark Souls games, I can really only endorse the first game. The level/world design of the first game was unrivaled with each game becoming more linear and less ""swiss cheese-like"" in how interconnected each area is to the whole rest of the world. This interconnectedness made the first souls game so very amazing.This game feels too polished and lacks the clunkyness of real world armored combat that the first game had. The weight of the movesets was a mechanic unto itself, where learning the timing and reach of the weapons were essential to successfully finishing an enemy before their hits connect.This game feels too much like Devil May Cry with all the fancy movesets. I would rather play Lords of the Fallen than this game.Feels more generic and far less mysterious and confusing than first Dark Souls. Lack of mystery affords less rewarding experience for accomplishing anything in the game because it is too straight forward. Glad they are not making a 4th Dark Souls as it would be too diluted from the original formula to be anything worth playing.",0
Negative,"So this game has a huge issue with hackers, like a HUGE issue the anti-cheat system in place is an ABSOLUTE joke. Like hackers can basically anything you can think of an experienced CE user can do it. One of the things that DOES ban you however is if you have an illegal or impossible item item in your inventory such as a stormruler +69. Now recently there has been a malicious script floating around that enables hackers to force said illegal items into other players inventories and get their accounts banned. As shitty as that situation was you COULD just make another stream account and family share the game to your new account to get yourself UN-Banned. As of today because FROMSOFT disabled familysharing of a game YOU LEGALLY OWN. You can no longer do this, this change is absolutely TERRIBLE because it enables malicious hackers to PERMANENTLY get innocent players banned. Fuck From Software and fuck Dark Souls 3 , DON'T Waste your money on this POS.",0
Negative,Alright game. But Bandai Namco / From Software have the worst consumer service I've seen in years. I've been banned for years. And don't even know why. Maybe picked up something a hacker dropped. And after 4 years it says no changes have been made so I will stay banned. Yet I reformatted my hard drives. Reinstalled Windows once a years. To make sure there was nothing on my PC that was messing me up. All characters are deleted. What else is left to do? But no one from this company is checking if any changes have been made to my PC. In my 25 years of gaming I have NEVER been banned from anything before. And have never been treated this way before. Keep away from this one. Or you might paid 60+ dollars for a game you can't play,0
Negative,I love this game (my favorite in the series despite its flaws) but it's been 2 months now and the servers still aren't up. Believe it or not I miss the PVP in this game. Pls bring them back,0

Negative,"Online play is absolutely terrible. -People you summon might be ice-skating around and the same goes for invaders, hitting you with no animation and being impossible to attack. When being summoned to another hosts world you might have similar problems with lagging and even NPCs being statues taking dmg 5 seconds after being hit.-Covenants are absolutely broken. Blue Sentinels and Darkmoon Blades are the same thing and both share dependancy on way of the blue users. Not only does the way of the blue player need to be around the same level and weapon upgrade level they also need to have not defeated the area boss, so this leads to people never getting summoned as a blue in 200+ hours of gameplay. The matchmaking is even broken beyond that allowing some people to be consistently summoned as blues due to being prioritized for unknown reasons, making everyone else wait forever. So hope you will be one of the prioritized players or you will never be able to get any PvP with those 2 covenants ever.-Rosarias Fingers covenant is also completely useless, you never need to equip the covenant item as you can invade as any other covenant except for mound makers and Sunbros and be always rewarded with pale tongues which are the reward for Rosarias covenant. As a result players end up with hundreds of Pale tongues that they can do absolutely nothing with since every covenant item is worthless beyond 30. The general feeling you get is that the covenant system is an afterthought added into the game with no depth whatsoever. Grind 30 of each item and never bother with the covenants again.-Invading is broken. You invade a host who can have 3 phantoms at the same time, each with Estus flasks to heal themselves and the host with 25% increased health due to being embered. If you somehow manage to kill a phantom the host can immediately summon another. So have fun invading into a 4v1 gankfest with the latency inconsistencies mentioned.Play through the game offline and experience the different endings and never look back and never go online and you will have a good time. If you try PvP or online play you will be gravely disappointed.",0
Negative,Thank you Bandai Namco for such a great anti-cheat system. After disabling family share option I cannot play online anymore. P.S. Boss Rush and Cinders are great mods btw.,0
Negative,"No cloud saving, is this a joke ? (almost all the games on steam have this service)Lost my 37 hours save because of that.",0
Negative,dont play this game right online right now as there is a remote executable exploit that puts your pc at risk.,0
Negative,"Do not get the game yet, as the servers are not up and are a pretty important part of the game.",0
Negative,"My game has been ruined by an exploit which the developers could have fixed but chose not to. It's unacceptable. Indeed this exploit has been described as possibly allowing other players to negatively influence your computer in ways outside of just influencing your save.This game is literal malware, and should be removed from steam until the developers have fixed it.",0
Negative,"No Cloud Saves. This is the exactly the kind of game that absolutely needs to have cloud saves. It's easy to implement. Almost every developer, large and small, does it. The worst part is that the game makes a big, dramatic fuss about ""Syncing"" and ""Retrieving your save data"" every time you start it. But all of that is for nothing. The game works *exactly* as if your game saves were stored locally only. Any time you have an issue with Windows, need to free up space or whatever, your progress is irretrievably wiped. The game forgets that it was ever installed on your system.",0
Negative,"The game itself is excellent in most respects. From Software's treatment of their paying customers? Not so much. I was banned from multiplayer on accusations of cheating/hacking: I have not modified the game in any way whatsoever and From offered no evidence in support of their claims. They won't be getting a dollar from me ever again, and if even 1/4 of the internet is to be believed, I am far from the only one who has been treated this way. Buy this game if you like giving your money to people who then make false accusations and ban you from using a major part of the product you paid them for.",0
Negative,"Wonderful game, can't recommend enough. However, some hackers have recently become active who can put your character in a NG/NG+ (with all of your gear, inventory and SL) through the very fact of your summoning or invading into your world. Doing so makes your character vulnerable for anti-cheat ban cause now you look like a cheater. Word is that it was reported to the devs about exploits in the net code but they didn't respond. And now here I am, losing all 66h progress of my first run because of this.Stay safe and use anti-cheaters modes, now I am aware that there are some good options out there.",0
Negative,Servers still down.,0
Negative,The servers are down still even after 2 months.,0
Negative,"I'm really trying to like this game but i get invaded every 5 minutes by either a player who clearly has much much much better stuff then i have or a straight up cheater. I also feel like i cant criticize this game without all the fanboys acting like i just butchered their Sacred cow. I loved the pvp in dark souls 1 and 2 so its not like i just don't like dark souls pvp. I'm not sure what i don't like more. How toxic this game can be or the people who are willing to defend it. Its like people cant understand that maybe there's a happy medium between getting invaded every 10 minutes by someone whos clearly got far better stuff then you and never getting invaded at all. I had to literally go offline for the aldrichs faithful area cause of how insane it gets. Which is sad cause i used to love the coop community and the invasion community. I love taking part of it and doing the covenant stuff but this just goes to an extreme. Hopefully this is just cause of the covid-19 and everyone is just online right now cause if this is the norm i have seriously lost respect for these developers. Also when people say that is excusable merely cause those are the intended game mechanics i really think you have your head up your dark hole. Just cause its an intended game mechanic doesn't even remotely mean that its a good one. I can make a game mechanic that makes it so you have to hit an enemy 1 million times before you kill then and they only have to hit you once to kill you plus your character is blind so your screens black and oh your opponent can move faster than you can react.that doesn't mean anything cause just its in the game. And those who say ""stop complaining and just play offline"" just show how bad the pvp really is. Cause that means i literally have to stop playing a decently big part of the game all cause of one toxic mechanic. I shouldn't have to forgo many fun gaming mechanics cause of one terrible one. ""go offline"" isn't a solution its a testament to how bad this game is with pvp. I'm sure some people are going to rabidly defend this games pvp but hopefully those who are actually willing to put down the pitch forks and listen hopefully this review can give you some insight. There is alot good about this game but thats no excuse for how terrible the pvp portion is.",0

Negative,no online multiplayer server support since Elden Ring released. I was looking forward to playing DS3 in co-op with a friend while I wait for Elden ring to get a few patches but that's no longer an option -.- 4/10.,0
Negative,"I've been trying SO HARD to actually enjoy this game. And the first DS for what matters. On the paper these are games I should love: I really like the art style, the theme, the quirkiness. The inventive bosses design, the many way the game can be played, the many weapons, etc.I like the slow pace, being rewarded for being clever and thinking outside the box. Love the exploration, the level design.I should love this game but I just can't.I played twice: a few years ago for about 8 hours and again now, because of the hype around Elden Ring, I wanted to give this franchise a second shot. I've also played a bit more hours of DS1 which I prefered overall.Now I've been stuck again for hours at end with the first boss, Iudex Gundir. I can almost kill him but just by luck most of the times.I tried not fighting him to understand his attack patterns, I played defensive waiting for my window of opportunity and then striking him. The second phase is what I find unfair: the boss assumes a shape so odd and so big that it's really hard to tell what's going on on the screen, to begin with. There's no way to understand its patterns because I just can't see shit of what's going on. Overall after hours of trying to fight the same boss, I see no progress at all. It is just too much frustrating.I gave up. My theory on this Souls game: some people have grown up playing this type of 3D games with controller, I've never owned a console apart from an ATARI 2600 in the late 80s and a NES. I believe I'm just not trained enough to play 3D games with a controller.And then when I look at people playing it on YT they make it look super easy, I saw people beating Iudex Gundir at their first try. There's something to get used to that I just can't see. The movement system, the constant timing of the rollings, getting used to the timings of the hits.I don't know, I'm a bit jealous of people that are enjoying this kind of games because I can see the appeal but I have to admit to myself I'm not meant to play and enjoy them.Have fun!EDIT: Out of spite, I've bought Elden Ring and I'm really enjoying it, especially the combat! It may sound absurd but I believe after I'll finish ER I'll give the old DS games a third chance. Thanks for all the awards, you git gud folks!",0

Negative,"I enjoyed the game, but my progress got reset because of a retarded hacker. Think they should invest in some anti cheats. Not invest anymore time in the game until they get shit sorted out.Always save you game files after each boss if you wanna be sure.",0
Negative,"This is my personal opinion""I expected nothing and was still let down"" describes how I feel about this game and here is why:I have played a whole lot of Dark Souls 1 and 2 and some bloodbourne on console and have been a huge fan since. To begin with I have to say the game plays amazingly fluent in PvE. Hitboxes are great, rolls feel really smooth. The bosses are some of the most memorable fights in the entire series. Although I dislike the artstyle of bloodbourne and Dark Souls 3, I have to say the game looks great, not amazing but great. Since the release of Dark Souls 2 I became a massive Pvp enthusiast. Despite great flaws Dark Souls 2 offered endless motivation: a sheer endless amount of builds, weapon variety, great possibilities to outplay your opponent and much more. I feel like Dark Souls 3 misses out on so many of these things. Backstep invincibility frames are gone, power stance is gone, arenas are gone. This game feels like a downgrade in terms of online gameplay to me. Furthermore most of the weapons feel the same. Movesets are mostly the same and nothing extraordinary. Weight makes no difference for stamina recovery or invincibility frames which then gives no reason to use light weight armor at all. Also NG+ is another disappointment. No new enemies, no new armor or weapons, only upgraded versions of rings. So no real motivation to go into NG+ at least for me. As for now one of the most core mechanics of the series is simply turned off: Poise. Wearing heavy armor used to give your character poise which resulted in you not being stunlocked by light attacks. Now that this is turned off you can get stunlocked by a rat even when wearing heavy armor. Bandai namco is denying that this feature is turned off and are simply saying: ""works as intended"". In other words there is little to no hope this will ever get fixed. Dark Souls 2 has been a complete mess the first months after release too but not like this. Despite insanely broken weapons, spells, mechanics the game was still fun. I can not say this for Dark Souls 3. I want to love this game but I can't. All in all: If you are looking for singleplayer, this is your game. But in terms of online gameplay and PvP this game blows as for now. Maybe it will be fixed, probably not.",0

Game itself was very good.",0
Negative,"I'll start this off with saying I'm a huge fan of FromSoftware and their games. Dark Souls and Demon Souls are games that are great enough to have an entire genre based off of them. Across the Dark Souls trilogy I have over a thousand hours across PS4 and PC - so it goes without saying I've enjoyed it at some point.To get to the point, the issue with Dark Souls III isn't the game, it's a chunk of it's community in online play. I'm not going to sit here complaining about 3v1s, cheesy tactics or chugging, but there's so many cheaters here now. A big part of Dark Souls for a lot of players is the PvP, but whats the point when people can teleport you/mobs, deliver instant kills from nowhere or toggle invincibility?I mean just recently while invading as an Aldrich Faithful, my screen went black then I got a ""You Died"" screen pop up repeatedly while I lost all my souls. Couldn't even do anything aside from force closing the game as I was stuck in a cycle of death. As far as I'm aware, that's shouldn't be possible. Sometimes you meet some cool people who respect the game and people trying to play it, and you'll get a fair game. But with how rampant it's been today I feel like I have to leave this negative review.I was hoping to get back into this game's PvP after a long hiatus, but I really couldn't recommend it - hopefully one day they find a way to prevent it from happening, but I'm sure someone will still find a way to ruin it.As a side note - might be worth buying on discount as a game to play offline.For any real players still out there, you're masochists.",0

Negative,Clearly i love this game but after 2 months of the servers being offline all they did was remove the multiplayer tag from the dark souls games on steam. The online component is a pretty big part of DS3 for me. Some of my most memorable moments in this game were just messing around with other people. I guess that's not happening anymore.,0
Negative,"For the time being this is going to be a negative review, don't get me wrong the game is great and all but I would like to point out a lot of aspects that just make the game bad and no I am not going to rant about the bad optimization but rather the overall feeling of the game and how the ""PVP"" works.Right let's start it off with this game is not hard, the bosses themselves feel quite easy to kill especially with adapt not being in the game anymore its not so much of a challenge to roll out of certain attacks or for the most part you don't even have to roll at all you just use a shield and block all of the attacks yes that is possible now and makes the fights feel just that much easier.Here is an example of a new player to the souls series taking down Pontiff Sulyvahn on their second try:For the PVP it feels like a step back from the Dark Souls 2 more strategy orianted PVP to more Bloodborne mixed with Dark Souls 1 which was okay but that was 2011 and I would like to see an upgrade not a downgrade. For parrying it doesn't even feel rewarding anymore because its so easy to pull off unlike in Dark Souls 2 where you had to know your timings very well to do the parry. As for the rest of the PVP R1 spamming is more rewarding along with shield whoring not only that but its nearly impossible to break through greatshields also I would like to point out that the weapon arts feature feels like its a thing for newcomers to the Dark Souls series because you get a skill with a push of a button like seriously earn your kill don't rely on a in game ""skill"" to help you win. Two more things I would like to point it is the chugs, iframes and HP as an invader. In Dark Souls 2 you would have adaptibilty as your source of iframes and your chug speed which was a great idea it would stop the host from trying to chug and if he had phantoms with him they were not allowed to chug and the host could not heal them by chugging which made ganking situation more fair in a sense that you had a chance to kill the phantoms and the host. However in Dark Souls 3 there is no adat and everyone can chug and also the host has extra 300hp bonus thanks to the ember how does that make things fair I mean sure you can chug so what if the other phantoms can chug too I do know that you get an estus for each phantom you kill but that doesn't necessarily mean that its more ""fair"".Overall the setting of the game and feel is fantastic the game immerses you very well into its world and is very nostalgic so many things to remind you of the past and I really do love Miyazki for brining back most of these things that we loved about Dark Souls 1 but nostalgia cannot save the game alone.If the PVP does change which it will of course they have to balance out the game but in its current state I will leave this review as it is and when the game changes ovetime I will re-write my review and give my definitve answer.",0

Negative,"I love the souls series. I've played 'em all for hours on end. Even this one, you'll find, i've sunk 300 hours into. But 299 of those hours were spent lying to myself. I was happy that soul memory was gone, and that the password system had made it in. But the password system wasn't the only thing they took from Bloodborne. The combat system functions more like Bloodborne than Dark Souls. Dark Souls was about being caution, timed blocking and stamina management. Now it's about being fast, and agressive. That worked in Bloodborne, but Dark Souls 3 gives you the tools to play cautiously, like other souls entries, but encourages that you play fast and agressive. There are many risks to playing slowly and carefully such as being guard broken or being overwhelmed, but all these risks can be negated by abusing the powerful dodge roll. It costs little stamina and has incredible frames, which can be further buffed by rings. The plot is a mess. ""Time is convoluted in Lordran"" is what we're told, but that statement can be used to answer most lore questions. There are a few interesting character questlines, and these really shine. When the game isnt appealing to your nostalgia by directly and unironically refrencing the previous games is where Dark Souls 3 perks up. But then they recycle a theme, location or straight up character and the game shrugs its shoulders and says ""time is convoluted but isnt it cool they're here?"" The DLC does little to bring anything new, content to wallow in nostalgia. They even go as far as to make a certain boss painfully similar to a Bloodborne boss. Anything new is shoved aside and concluded poorly to focus on refrences. One of the most praised elements of Dark Souls 3 is its level design, but even there the laziness shows. The world isn't interconnected, like Dark Souls 1. There are 3 branching paths that are available later in the game; a secret area acessed pretty cleverly, a second secret area accessed by going left in a fork in a road, and the DLC. The rest of the levels are in sequence. The level themselves are pretty boring, however. They do look good and are visually pleasing, but very often rely on ""find a bonfire and then unlock shortcuts back to that bonfire."" There are very few options for alternate ways to progress, as most levels are incredibly linear. Some areas either have a shortcut available that just needs some clever dropping/jumping, or are simply huge open forested areas. Exploring these areas yields very little, as equipment is very limited. There are plently of weapons available, but each weapon class has its clear best choice, while the other weapons in its category are largely worse. There is no replayability in Dark Souls 3. Once you've beaten the game, you'll find that NG+ has nothing new to offer except some stronger versions of already exsisting rings. The only point to NG+ aside from the rings is resetting your respec currency and respawning the bosses. The bosses are where the game really shines, sometimes. There are very few unique and original ideas for bosses here. They tried to step away from armored humanoids that Dark Souls 2 continued to throw at us, but ended up relying on that trope too much again. So many bosses are praised to be the best in the series, when they're painfully generic. The soundtrack sounds good, but all the songs are interchangable. ""An orchestra has a fit while a woman goes ""ahhhhhhhhhhh"" sums up most tracks in the game. A lot of bosses are just more nostalgia pandering as well, as they all have some tie to a previous souls game. It wouldn't be so bad if they expanded on the refrence, but they dont. The refrences are there just to refrence. That's it. The bosses can be defeated by rolling through their attack, then pressing your attack button as fast as you can. Rinse, repeat, dead. There are very few bosses that deviate from this, but the ones that do either die in one hit after jumping through some hoops or are defeated using a special weapon that directly refrences Demons Souls. I tried to tell myself that all the obvious pandering, poor gameplay and horrible multiplayer was ok. It was more Dark Souls, that's not a bad thing. But it is. From Software designed Dark Souls 3 to be a trip down memory lane, to be experience once and then shelved. It might be the closest thing we get to Bloodborne on the PC, but that doesn't mean i'm supposed to ignore the issues and praise it because it's the last entry in the series. It's unfortunate that Dark Souls had to end this way. If you're looking to pick up Dark Souls 3, don't. Play the other entries in the series and don't spoil your love for the series with this lazy attempt to appeal to it.",0
Negative,"Servers still down after 3 months! For a game franchise that has such a massive loyal fan base and community and they hit us with something like this. I cant even explain the amount of disgust and shock that a company would even try to harm their community the way they have done. all the souls borne are absolute masterpieces and new players to the franchise that are might come from Elden Ring will never experience the same experience that all us fellow fans have experienced (yes they can play solo but were is the PVP or even messages to leave for new players to guide them on there journey). I'm not sure if the developers had looked at the success of Sekiro (I love the game BTW) and thought that they could do the same thing to dark souls but it just does not translate into a game like Sekiro. I know for a fact that I am not the only one thinking this as anyone can see on this page dark souls used to be above 93% positive and now its been lowered to 76% and counting. I understand why they took the servers down to fix a serious issue but there are people who have already written the crucial lines of code that could be implemented and then everyone is happy, to me it does not make sense with the launch of Elden ring for people that complete it they can revisit / be introduced to dark souls. Please bring the servers back thank you.",0
Negative,"I have mixed feelings about Dark Souls 3. On one hand, it's not obviously bad in some places like Dark Souls 2, but on the other I don't know what this game is trying to be. It has elements from all 4 Soulsborne games that don't go well together. It's definately an enjoyable game, if you're into the Souls series, but also disappointing in some ways. Let's start out with the positive side of Dark Souls 3:+The game looks gorgeous, no question about that. Probably the best looking Souls game on PC to date. +The world is huge and well connected. Not quite as well connected as DS1, but you can see other areas from your current area (like seeing the Bell tower from Sen's Fortress) and there are no weird Earthen Peak -> Iron Keep situation. +It is easier than every to play with friends with the new password system (although I've seen people say it doesn't work)Now let's talk about what I don't like in Dark Souls 3:-My main problem with the game is the change of pace. Enemies are a LOT more agressive this time around, with seemingly infinite stamina and long combos. It gets particularly bad mid to late game when enemies get a ridiculous damage and health boost. The game essentially punishes you hard if you do anything other than roll and mash attack. Tanking is pretty much pointless (you can't even upgrade armor) and magic users are at a serious disadvantage compared to previous games since their casting speed is so slow and scaling is so messed up early to mid game that you'll be spending more time swinging a sword than casting Soul Arrow. I heard scaling gets better around 50 INT/FTH but I don't care enough to get to that point. -There is a LOT of reused content in this from all previous Souls games. I don't want to spoil it, but there are more recycled characters than new ones. Same could be said about the armor and weapon sets. There is an area that is LITERALLY ripped straight from Dark Souls 1. I know the official explanation is some time distortion shit, but really it's just lazy pandering. I can bash Dark Souls 2 all day, but at least it had more original content than this-Covenants are kind of half baked. People have been reporting that some don't even work properly. -This is the THIRD game on PC that still has fucking Xbox prompts. Why is no one complaining about this? Some people actually play with a keyboard and it's not even that much effort. Modders have been doing it since DS1. Maybe I'm just tired of the Souls formula at this point, but at it's current state Dark Souls 3 is not as fun to play as Dark Souls 1. It's certainly better than Dark Souls 2 but that's not really saying much. I would advise you to wait for the inevitable GOTY edition which will hopefully fix the gameplay issues I have with the game. As it stands it's an okay game, with some really glaring issues.",0

Negative,"The bad is far outweighing the good these days on Dark Souls 3 PC. The biggest issue is of course hackers. They're rampant at the meta (SL100-SL140), and there is absolutely nothing you can do when they hit you with a Souls hack, once it has been done you must delete your character and start over, and for someone with as many hours as I've put in on not only PC, but PS4 over 800 hours, Xbox over 500, and on PC 421 hours, most of which was with CHARACTERS I HAD TO DELETE BECAUSE OF HACKERS. It sucks the joy out of the game, and then these trolls sit here sipping their Mountain Dew making excuses for why they hack. It's SIMPLE, you suck at the game, therefore you feel the need to hack. All the cool things these hackers could do and they try (and often succeed at) getting legit players banned. It's not funny, in anyway, and only serves to anger the good people that paid with their hard earned money for a game that penalises the victim rather than the villain. If I end up getting softbanned, because a hacker modified my save file I'll just go back to PS4 painful as it will be considering the lower grade graphics, and FPS, but it's a lot better than dealing with hackers on a daily basis. If you're just now getting the game, play offline.",0
Negative,"Dark Souls 3 is not a bad game, but I wouldn't recommend it unless you have no other Souls-likes in From Software's catalogue to play. If there is another Souls-like in From's catalogue you haven't played yet, go play that instead.Dark Souls 3 is an awkward compromise between Dark Souls and Bloodborne. It wants you to play with the speed and agression of Bloodborne, and so it nerfs or removes many of the defensive mechanics from previous Dark Souls games, like poise. At the same time, because it wants to be a sequel to previous Dark Souls games, it does not include any of the mechanics that make Bloodborne's pace of play fun, like rallying. The result is a game with a confused mechanical identity. While Dark Souls 3 is by no means bad (none of From's modern games are bad), it is the least fun to play out of all of From's Souls-likes.",0
Negative,"Mechanically speaking, it feels like some weird middle ground between the combat of Bloodborne and Dark Souls, and not always in a good way. The backstory is likewise a jumbled mess with inconsistencies and hanging threads everywhere, despite the actual plot you follow being basically a retread of the first game. That isn't a bad thing in itself, but it compounds the other story issues when the first kept things so much more coherent even in ambiguity. There's still some brilliant level design to be found, although it's balanced out by some equally stupid design choices. As well, the setpiece fights are as gorgeous as ever, but some enemies are so big and visually busy as to obscure their own tells (a problem leftover from Bloodborne), making fighting them that much worse. Netcode seems noticeably sloppier too, given how often phantoms get bugged out of joining boss fights- I've been on both ends of that problem myself.If you're a big fan of the series and dead set on playing this final entry, I guess I can't blame you. Just know that this swan song stumbles as much as it succeeds, and if you came for closure, you're going to be disappointed.",0
Negative,"The game gets a load more hate than it should, it's not as bad as people say.

Negative,"They just removed family sharing from this game as a warning. Dark Souls 3 is a fantastic game and I love it.

Now my choices are: Buy this game again because of someone else or play only with people who have also been soft banned (my friends who play are not on said list). If From Software was going to decide to do this they should at least ACTIVELY restore wrongfully punished accounts.Now again, this is a great game and has tons of replay value, but if you have a chance to randomly get banned and have no fix, what's the point?EDIT: After appealing to Namco support my account is finally unbanned after over a year, but they've said next time a character gets modified it's a permanent ban.

Negative,"Dark souls 3 is frustratingly amazing, but in its current state I do not recommend the purchase of this title.Dark souls pc servers have been offline for two months as of the time of this review, due to an rce exploit.

With the most recent title exceeding 500,000 players at any given time I wouldn't be surprised if the Servers never come back as they're most likely being used. I can't imagine they would release Elden Ring without patching this issue, or maybe they just slapped easy-anti-garbage onto it as a band-aid fix and this could possibly explain why from has been on hiatus in regards to any announcements outside of the obligatory post on feb9/10.currently 4 out of 5 souls games are not playable online, so no ghosts, messages, bloodstains, co-op/multiplayer/pvp. all online aspects for the pc dark-souls series are currently inoperative, if you play exclusively for these reasons i would recommend to play on console.edit: officially offline for three months.",0

Don't get misled by all those 10's disgorged by fanboys, they're only playing it to prove how amazingly pro and superior they are to 'casuals'. If you look at any gameplay, you will see within 10 seconds EVERYTHING that games has to offer - a roll and a hit. That's all there's to it. Some of the enemies are gonna be bigger, some of the weapons are gonna be more rusty. But in the end this 60 dollar 'masterpiece' can be summarised in three words: roll and hit. 1/10.

Negative,"It's certainly a bad look that FromSoft's multiplayer service was demonstrated to give hackers command access to user's computers, even worse when you know that their policy before the leak was to just ban anyone who was invaded by a hacker, but at least they shut the online servers down after the leak. I honestly don't miss the frequent interruptions by smurfing invaders that typified my experience with the previous Dark Souls games, so that was no loss to me. Unfortunately the problems with this entry run deeper.Dark Souls games have been lauded for being very tough but essentially fair, and I found that to be largely true in the previous games. Sure, enemies will get the drop on you now and then with ambushes and tricks, but there was at least a sense that the game was internally consistent, the enemies at least seemed to play by the same rules as you.In this game it's obvious that half the enemies have infinite poise (resistance to interruptions), and even if they've just finished a long string of heavy attacks that missed and you're swinging in to punish them, don't be surprised to get interrupted mid-swipe by an immediate new combo because they also have clearly infinite stamina and YOUR poise stat counts for nothing. Oh you're a heavily armored knight with very high poise you say? Well you better keep your shield up to any knife wielding ghouls or dog-sized rats because they'll knock you right out of your stance with one jab to your armored shins.If the previous games were 90% hard and 10% BS, this one's about 75/25. It's still not a majority but that's a lot of bull to take, it grates on a person. It's probably a similar overall difficulty level to previous games, but it's been sped up significantly, which has the knock-on effect of making victory rely more on reflexes and luck rather than just caution, knowledge, and timing. The bosses in the first 10 hours have either been very fast and relentless, or very big but able to do high damage over a large area, in both cases they lacked useful tells or inertia to many of their attacks. I would end up winning - sometimes on the 1st, sometimes on the 10th attempt - by simply running in to do as much damage as I could, taking the unavoidable damage as a result, then retreating to heal, and repeating until they were dead or I was. Caution was essentially useless because any attempt to mitigate the damage either drained my stamina more (blocking) or resulted in much less damage to the enemy (retreating early), and usually resulted in taking just as damage anyway.It's possible that since people loved Bloodborne so much (since it was brilliant in a lot of other ways too), they thought we just wanted to be all aggression all the time, so defense and caution in Dark Souls 3 was nerfed even more. but it's at odds with itself, you still get punished for going all-offense like Bloodborne a lot of the time, the net result is the game is just more punishing.",0

Almost 400 hours in the game, and I just wanna be able to summon help for the final boss.",0
Negative,"The game is decent but I can't give it a good review for the following reasons:1- From bans undeserving players in many, many ways.2- They don't communicate properly in regards to anything at all (patches, exploits etc.)3- Certain essential stats (such as Poise) don't work, and again, zero communication from the developer",0

The solution is to pull HOTAS cables out.I don't like to review a game when I didn't put some time in it. But as devs didn't put any effort into it so that it would be playable on PC without a game controller .",0
Negative,As much as I didn't like the servers being removed I accepted it however it wasn't until about 6 hours into my new run to realize that certain spells and weapons are now unattainable because PvP is gone.

Negative,"As much as I love the dark souls franchise, I simply CAN NOT give this product a thumbs up in its current state because of a devastating and unacceptable issue that fromsoftware and bandai refuse to address. There are hackers on this game that will invade your world and AUTO INJECT hacked items onto your character unconsentually ( there is nothing you can do to stop them from putting these items in your inventory), and the next time you log onto dark souls you will be perm banned and unable to play online ever again.There is literally no way to drop these hacked items once they are given to you, so at that point you are either faced with a decision, to either alt f4 and delete your character with possibly hundreds of hours of progress (and hope this method works) or get perm banned from the game for life.So now if you choose to play this game online with friends you are essentially gambling because you can be invaded at any time by one of these hackers and their sole purpose is to just get you banned. There's nothing you can do about it. This issue needs to be fixed and addressed now. I don't care if this game came out in 2016, if you are selling a product for $59.99 or any amount of money and you just simply drop it and refuse to take care of it, then it doesn't deserve to be bought.PATCH THIS GAME AND STOP BANNING INNOCENT PLAYERS!",0
Negative,"PVE is less inspired and way less fun than both of the other games, for a wide variety of reasons I don't really feel like describing.PVP is completely unplayable garbage, and clearly just an afterthought to the base game of PVE.* Nightmarish latency issues that are routinely as bad as dial-up internet used to be, or worse. I'm talking ping in the thousands. In the range of actual full seconds.* The mechanics of game are designed for none of the above. Sidestepping is virtually impossible, and if you try it, you will probably get ""hit"" by the sword that is visibly ~4m away from you.* Apparently some information is handled client-side while other information is not, meaning that you can roll away from a swing, hear the sound effect for damage received on your screen but take none of it, and somehow wind up with bleeding also even though you (I think?) didn't get hit.* The actual method of getting PVP going is terribly designed. The dedicated arenas are only active for 1v1s because apparently actual organized teams just stomp all through the brawls and team battles so no one plays them.* The more common way this happens is with impromptu ""fight clubs"" that only happen at a very narrow range of player levels where a host will invite players in to essentially duel.* Sometimes though, no one cares and you wind up summoned into a 3v1 where they just slaughter you, or it's a ""duel"" until someone decides it's not anymore. Impossible to know what place you've been summoned to beforehand.* Add all that to the several minutes it takes to actually get a connection to play with someone else, and you wind up with an hour of PVP mostly spent waiting around for a summon and getting ganged up 3v1 with virtually no chance.* Even coop PVE suffers from most of these issues, including hit reg that's so bad it is sometimes impossible for the non-host to damage enemies because of the server rolling back what you're seeing client-side, resulting in enemy health bars that just kinda oscillate when you hit them.In summary, this game is not at all designed for PVP and shoehorning it into this is a buggy, laggy mess of unplayable garbage. Which is a real shame, because the actual multiplayer aspect could have been fun if they just fixed a few of these trivial issues no video games since 2003 have had any problems with. I recommend DS2 instead.",0
Negative,"Main thing people enjoy about the games is being able to co-op/pvp and at this time THAT IS NOT AVAILABLE.

Negative,"Going to have to thumbs this Game down(would Give it a Mixed rating if i could).And will explain why and my thoughts on this game.First off: Dark Souls 3 is a fantastic game, I had put more then 70+ hours in just the main Game/Story to beat it(2nd boss as well), And it is indeed a fantastic Action Rpg game(one of the best of 2016). Some Thing's i noticed in this game(small complaint):1: The poise System is pretty much non existent, So armor is pretty much for fashion after a certain point.2: Some delay in the controls(about a second deley when pressing the dodge button.ect).3: No way to turn of Vsync(Vsync causing Imput lag/delay). Why the thumb's down?The Online Security System: Well, This is where i start to hate how this game works, and The Main reason is ""THE SERVERS SECURITY"" And here is why(Console are excluded from this, as it's a PC thing). It seems the game will try to detect certain software as a Cheat/hack(like Controller or Recording softwares), Basically Causing a message ""Invalid Data"" and even if you delete your data(Completely All Save's and in Appdata), They will still ban you(Yes, They banned me for NO REASON) And, When you contact bandai they basically tell you off and wont do anything about it(As they don't control the servers). You Can't even use your PS4 controller(At the time you need ""Inputmapper"" to use it), Because as soon as you jump online for the first time when you want to Coop, it will harrass you. So, The whole Fromsoft Online security is REALLY crap And a dodgy system if bandai Can't control this. Out of the 498+ games i own, i would say This is the first time i experience this, And had a server security in a game this ""HORRIBLE"".And NO, For the last time, i would never Hack or cheat.(i have no reason to). Thing's i Noticed While Online: The main one is the Online invasions(only goes to people that does this), This seems to be common in the newbie area's, You're Basically Getting invaded as soon as you set foot in high wall of lothric(When You're around level 8-16). I Do not mind getting invaded(as long is it with legit items/gear). This is where the complaint come's into place, Is when People Who invade Are those with end game Items/Spells/flasks that insta heals, And Because of This, it pretty much ruins it for new players. And this is starting to become more common now(if you play online). Conclusion: Get this on CONSOLE.That is If you want to Co-op with a friend(that's why i went online, And had got this game as well). Because, the servers anti Hack/cheat system in this game is REALLY crap on PC, And it will treat your pc software like i mention above like one and ban you(My friend who i was cooping had just been banned as well, As we where using the same software/controller to play).Edit:They had unbanned me 3 weeks later after i tried to get in contact with them.Their systems are still really crappy on PC.",0
Negative,"no online support since January due to a discovery of a system compromising bug that allows attackers to launch executable on targets while joined on a Online Session.

Negative,"Do not get tempted to buy this by false promises or maybe even your own memories of the previous Souls Game s PvP. In it s current state PvP absolute shit. It is unbalanced, outright broken and full of completely retarded features that are abused by 99% of the community because some moronic Youtubers talk trash on Reddit and reveal these features to the players. Seriously 90% of the fucking players are using the Dark Sword or a Estoc its ridiculous. Poise is nonexistent while the praised ""Hyper Armor"" lets you combo other players to death effortlessly. If you want to desperately win take a UGS and spam R1 you cant be countered. Generally PvP was lessened to mindless R1 spam and the blind Miyazaki dickriders are even praising it while belittling Dark Souls 2 and the ""B-Team"".PVE and especially the bosses are a huge improvement to Dark Souls 2 and the only reason to buy this game.

Enjoyable until softban for using a controller emulator (X360CE) that literally makes the game playable. Will update review if FROM adresses the community regarding banning players for playying the game normally.EDIT: 5/11/16To random people that see this review and find my word untrustworthy. I highly suggest browsing the net and looking for yourself, Bandai Namco/FROM literally state online in multiple outlets that they consider any code injection a breach of EULA and therfore bannable. Specifically including controller emulation. Thus the only recourse is to buy a 60 dollar xbox controller rather than use the controllers that most budget gamers already have. To reiterate, FROM / BN are BANNING people from the online elements (read ""a huge portion"") of the game for using off brand controllers with a controller emulator rather than an overpriced games for windows controller. They KNOW that thats all that said people have done (upon examining their accounts supposedly) and they just state to said people that ""no one has ever been un-banned once banned"".Thats shite customer service on top of shoddy programming, and I for one view that as an insult. If i could refund this shit i would. Instead, i muck through in solo play. Till they deside to ban me from that too for using a ps3 controller knock off.",0
Negative,"The multiplayer servers went down a bit before Elden Ring's release due to an exploit and they are STILL down.This is a great game and I've played through it several times, but the whole exploit thing sucks. I got three of my friends to buy this game about a week before the servers went down, so now we can't play our new game together. We decided to just wait, because From Software announced that they would start working on a patch once Elden Ring was out.But it's been months. Within a week of the exploit going public, there was already a fan-made patch for it, so it's not even a hard fix.The part that bothers me the most is that Elden Ring is the only souls game that currently has multiplayer, which is pushing more sales for it. If me and my friends want to play one of these games together, we either have to wait months for the exploit to be patched or buy yet another $60 game. Call me crazy, but I think From is avoiding patching it for the sake of profits.EDIT: The servers are back up. Took them long enough.",0

Negative,"Not sure what I think about this game. The fact it has so many options and interesting combinations seems very attractive, but from my view, and it will be very unpopular, the combat system is trash. Very clunky and not at all enjoyable from my experience. A game I have to do hours of research to understand the meta to have the best chance of playing as a new player alone is taxing, let alone the fact that the controls aren't very responsive at all. It becomes frustrating quite quick. As punishing of a game as this is, unless you are a masochist, I'd probably pass on this one. Not one of those games you will sit down and enjoy for a few hours at a time.",0
Negative,"I would not recommend any of these games if you plan to play with friends. Invaders get way too much in their favor when it should be the other way around HEAVILY. They should have MAYBE 1-2 heal items or not be able to heal at all. Shouldn't be able to invade a new players game. There should be a tag that is associated with a new player that makes it so only other new players can invade new players games. I know all you purest shitbirds will come screaming ""just get gud"" or ""It's already not fair for the invaders"" blah blah blah. Firstly, just in general, there should be a setting that actually locks out invaders so you just play with your friends. Why have a password system if it's basically useless? Have it so you can set a password for invaders as well. Make it so they can't heal so damn much. FIX YOUR DAMN NETCODE IT'S TRASH. Among other things. I really want to like these games but right when I start having fun I get some neckbeard invader that has thousands of hours in the game that purposefully downgrades their gear because they know they can win against someone who just started playing the game. It's infuriating and definitely would be a reason I see a lot of people would stop playing before they actually get into enjoying it. Fix the netcode, put in a system that allows us to play with friends but blocks invaders, or just HEAVILY nerf invaders so it's a substantial uphill battle for them. They are there ruining your fun because ""haha lul get gud nerd I play this 5 year old game all day everyday to pwn noobs that just started the game haha"" Just do better please. If you guys added things like this your playerbase would increase drastically as I know several people that like the core of the game but absolutely loathe the invasion system. Again, call me a noob, tell me to get gud, whatever, I don't care about unwanted pvp in my games. If I wanna pvp I will play a game where that is all it is so it's actually balanced. Or on a pvp specific server for those games.",0

Gameplay 11/10.Service - Meh.Edit 2.28.2018The reply from customer services sums up to this: can't do crap. Everything is handled by Japan's server team and the American team is the middleman. The solution is to delete your character and wait a month or two before playing again or make a family share account through steam and still start over again.This ban puts you in a separate server for suspected cheaters, screwing you if you want to play with your buddies or if you're innocent. If you invade or get invaded by a hacker your data will be affected and you get banned. There's no compensation, you're just starting over with a big F you. Since I bought this throught the humble bundle can't even expect a refund. Thanks for reading my gripes, hopefully my bit of suffering will enlighten you to not purchase this awesome yet crappy game.Edit 3.21.2018Enjoyed a good three weeks playing on a family share account before getting banned running into a hacker.

Negative,"Despite enjoying all of my time in game I can't really recommend this with the approach they take when restricting people from their game. I played the first couple days a few hours each in coop with my friend who I also bought the game for, and had no issues. We died to bosses, we died in invasions, we died on enemies we had previously beaten because we got overconfident, and basically we seemed right on track with the experience we expected of this game.Then on the third or fourth day, my main screen is flagged with ""INVALID GAME DATA"" has been detected and yatta yatta. I still don't know what the Invalid data was because it gave no indications as to what was actually invalid. Things I tried.* Deleting my current character with 16 hours invested. Annoying but okay. I continued playing online with a character from scratch, and my coop buddy helped me run through all the previous areas until we caught up again.*Installing game on another hard drive in case it was a hard disk problem on my end. My internet is slow, and it takes 10-15 hours to download, so this was my last resort. *Verifying integrity of game cache. Now it would seem to me if you get an error because ""INVALID GAME DATA"" this would be a pretty sure way to fix it. So I run this, and sure enough 1 file fails to validate. I'm thinking, ""Oh hey, here's my problem right here! Kinda douchebaggy to accude me of breaking their ToS because something didn't download right, but at least it's fixed now, and I don't have to worry."" Wrong.1 file fails to validate, and the game starts download 10.6 GB of data. The whole game is like 18GB, are you telling me a single file is that big? I felt it was bullcrap, but I let it do it's thing for the next 7 hours, and then when it totally finishes it slaps me with an error, ""Update File Corrupt""This is the reason I had to totally reinstall the game because there was absolutely no other choice now that my whole install was corrupted, and validating game files now resulted in it finishing in 1 second saying all files were validated, and hitting play resulted in downloading that same 10.6 GB of data across 7 hours which I did THREE times. to get the ""Update file corrupt"" problem again.So I reinstall the entire game, and wonder of wonders it works, and I start the game, and am met with ""YOU HAVE BEEN PENALIZED"" Are you serious From Soft? I can't help it your game broke. I carried on trying to believe it was my fault, but it's not. It's a bad system. After checking around this apparently means I'll be put in a matchmaking pool with other people who have been penalized. Which if it happens to everyone as easily as it did me, probly won't be so bad since I imagine just about everyone will have been penalized by now.The main reason this loss even affects me, is I have a coop buddy who I bought the game specifically to play through with, and we won't even be able to that since he isn't penalized(for now anyways.) If it weren't for coop with him I would just play offline since I have no interest in PVP. Normally when we're doing coop the two of us will get invaded by a single guy who kills us anyways, but we wasn't even mad, that's just part of the game. He's better than both of us so he wins 9/10 times.My problem comes from a total lack of transparency. It woulda been nice for them to tell me what this supposely ""Invalid data"" was so I could actually remove it and keep on playing.So overall, if you're gonna buy this game for any of the online features, I'd advise against it. The single player is pretty fun, though it's a lot more fun coop, but people can get treated unfairly a little too easily for my tastes.",0

When the RCE exploit was discovered, those same modders from the community had a fix within a day. What does From do? Shut the servers down and they're still down for the entire trilogy nearly two months later.",0
Negative,"I can see why this game is considered to be great, but it was also a very frustrating experience for me, in large part by design. Despite all the bad I have to say about DS3, if I could have a ""maybe"" option, I'd pick that, because DS3 is obviously meant for some people out there.For context, I went a primarily-faith build, so I have decent exposure to both melee combat and spell-casting. It took me about 40 hours, finished the base game at level 90, I believe both of those metrics are about average. Not sure if I'll bother with the DLC, but my point is I finished the game, so my problems aren't because I didn't git gud.The TL;DR of this is that DS3 basically met my expectations: this game puts being difficult ahead of being fun.First, the good. The boss fights are fantastic, the only thing keeping me going. Absolutely not overhyped. The music was also fantastic, and the world-building and build diversity are good. If you enjoyed this game, you'll find a lot of different builds to try out.Now, onto what I didn't like. This will surely be subjective in large part, but these reasons are why I'm not going to replay DS3 or try other games in the series.The combat system here is the opposite of another game they made, Sekiro. Whereas Sekiro is very narrow but deep, DS3 is very wide and shallow. DS3 may have more replayability, but DS3's combat was so limited in comparison that I have no desire to replay by the time I was done. I found DS3's combat to be clunky and not enjoyable at all, and how my character controls is the biggest factor in determining my enjoyment of a game.The world, while cool in theory and lore, looked abysmal. It was too damn dark all the time. I strained my eyes whenever I played this, and turning up the brightness to fix it washed everything out. I get that DS3 is meant to be dark, but I've never felt such strain playing a game before.The RPG system is more a neutral than a con, but I'll talk about it here anyways. My character felt like crap until I got to about level 40. Over 1/3 of the time I played this, I didn't like my character. Sure, I started to like him later, but 15+ hours is a long time to think ""When am I going to actually like my own character?""The save points (bonfires) were a huge negative for me too. At a minimum, every boss should have an accessible save point nearby - if you're too concerned that makes the bosses too easy, make them harder, but it's not fun trying to learn a boss, dying, then spending 1-2 minutes running back, hoping you don't get hit along the way. The final boss was my favorite in part because I got to focus on just killing it, not doing some dumb trek back past the same 10 skeletons every time.Also, no cloud saves, so don't clean your computer without manually backing it up (lost a 10-hour save due to that).All in all, the Dark Souls series just isn't for me. I beat the whole game so I could make sure my issues weren't because I couldn't beat it, plus I 100%ed Sekiro (one of my favorite games ever now that I checked that out too). The biggest issues were the poor combat and frustrating checkpoints, both of those made me want to rush this game as fast as I could. It's still a great game, in spite of all the trash I talked, just know that it's not for everyone, not even for all hardcore gamers.",0
Negative,"Too much hackers, please fix those vulnerabilities.Otherwise game is the best game evar m8.",0
Negative,"fuck this, i shat on this game twice might do it againits still shit 37 hours later",0
Negative,Got banned for no reason.please FROM SOFTWARE FIX YOUR ANTICHEAT,0
Negative,I've been playing this game for a while now and it's good but I can't recommend it as From Software have completely neglected the player base. They said they'll fix it after Elden Ring got released and they didn't. It has been way too long and I bought this game for my brother so we could play online just for this bullshit. Don't buy this game until it's fixed.,0
Negative,Since the game has been cut from online section. I've to not recommend it due to the huge chunk of the game that missing. At least just open the server FROM.,0
Negative,"Too buggy and poorly optimized to recommend and with random people getting banned for no reason. If the game works great for you it won't for long or you're simply lucky.I do really enjoy the faster paced combat and weapon arts. Hate to say anything positive tbh considering my extreme level of disappointment with what happened at launch. For me, the problem is a memory leak issue with the game causing fps drop and freezes with others reporting this as well, game runs smooth (not DS2 perfect though) when I have no other program open on my comp.From Software needs to learn how to make games for PC. Dark Souls had a shit ton of problems at launch as well. You think they would have learned from their mistakes.I am playing and having fun with DS3 for the most part, although so far it is the worst in the series mainly due to small, lame, level design and Bloodbourne copied enemies, it is the most poorly optimized game on the planet atm.What a slap in the face overall, seriously. I'll never buy another From title for more than 10 bucks. Fool me once with DS2 and DS2.5, and again with DS3's beyond horrible launch.never again.",0

Negative,"The game is excellent but I can't recommend it in for 2 reasons:- The servers are down since several months, we don't know for how much time. They fixed the security vunerabilitie(s) swiftly for Elden Ring, but can't seem to do it in a few months for the others souls. So you'll essentially buy a downgrade version of the original game, without the player's messages and PVP- Since Elden Ring success, the price of the other souls games increased a bit (that's greedy, but whatever). But as of today 22/04/2022, I see that Dark Souls 3 is at 60 . for a 6 years old game missing a good chunk of its content? Wtf? I really hope it's a bug.So yes, again, the game is excellent but I obviously can't recommend it in its current state",0
Negative,"Fromsoft doesn't care about pc players so there's no cheat prevention. Backup your save regularly if you want to play this game because cheaters can do whatever they want.Edit: nowadays you can use the ""Blue Sentinel"" mod to protect your save and to kick cheaters (and even glitch abusers). You can find it on nexusmods. Please spread the word about it, ideally everyone should use it as it fixes what fromsoft didn't fix (including a major vulnerability that can potentially let actual hackers fiddle with your pc).",0
Negative,"I love this game , but unfortunately I can't recommend it for pvp (pve in this game is amazing it's a 10/10). The state of pvp in 2022 is just very very very bad and infuriating, because 80% of the player base that remained are like a venom that course through the barely alive veins of this game. You will fight these ""amazing"" players that are 100% passive with a rotten ghru or pkcs or a dagger that will never attack first and just want you to attack first so they can outspace your attack and than punish it . And if you are like me a ""non-meta"" guy that uses claymore, fg, red hilted halberd etc, you will have a bad time . Another problem is cheating/exploiting . For exploits we have (estus cancel/fap glitch/bow glitch/rkss cancel) that are all broken and give the user a massive advantage, and the cheating problem in this game is massive ( from ragehacks to closet cheating to ""quality of life"" cheating ) : ragehacks : i didn't find a lot of people that toggled against me , but a day I found a ""good"" (a parasite) player that ran ghru curved sword and I was on the verge of winning when he hard swaps to gundyr's , gets me with the wa. I was on the floor and he immediately goes into a second wa that gets me while I was still on the floor, and btw when he did the first wa I hit him with an r1 that did no damage for some reason. So here I will stop my little rant, and I'm sorry that I coudn't cover everything. If there smth important that I might have missed pls tell me in the comments.",0
Negative,"I'll keep this short. The game is awesome, but constant crashes and stability issues with several aspects of the game is ruining the experiance. This game isn't finished and I wouldn't recommend it before it is.",0
Negative,Its pretty disappointed that i lost my save after moving to new pc.,0
Negative,"With the lack of online play and the patch not having arrived for a month now, I would not recommend this game. The game is good on its own but a chunk of the content is just missing, including the online contributions like blood stains and messages from other players. It adds a lot more to the game than you'd think, knowing you're not alone in your struggles. I hope the fix comes soon but I imagine the devs are more consumed with Elden Ring than anything else. It almost feels like they cut down on the support for Dark Souls 3 intentionally to bolster sales and support for Elden Ring. Seeing as it's been an entire month and Dark Souls 3 is still entirely offline, it sure as hell feels that way.Will change the review when the patch comes through, but can't in good faith recommend it in its current state.",0
Negative,every time i go into this game i get my ass handed to me by hackers how am i suppose to enjoy a game with full hackers i get though like 5 mins and get invaded and then a hacker blows up my entire screen (Not Joking) then the game fails and kicks me out of the game i can prove this via twitch videos and clips this game is unplayable for all of its gameplay and no offline mode is not a suitable answer for any of itif a game goes like this we should be issused a refund and i call out to all that have got this game to do the same,0
Negative,shit game got banned for no reason i was playing with a friend and then stopped around 2018 or 19 and we came back to play it about 2 days ago and in the intro it says i have been banned? LIKE WTF,0
Negative,I figured they'd had enough practice by now fucking up the PC ports that this one would be functional. Nope.Guess I'm returning this and getting the 30fps PS4 version because of unplayable stuttering.,0
Negative,"Good game, but mods got me banned from multi. This game has some of the worst anticheat I've ever encountered, so for the 2 people who are going to buy the game after my review is posted I recommend avoiding that which would make the game better.",0
Negative,"Bought game, installed, had a hacker join me right after Firelink Shrine. Kicked them, restarted game, ""INVALID DATA DETECTED"" and was banned for playing the game regularly 5 days later. Anticheat is trash if it bans the victim and not the perpetrator. Can't even get a refund now, either.",0
Negative,"I have no choice but to not recommend this game, because it may be a good game, but it's a garbage pc port. If you play with a controller it's acceptable, but that should not be a requirement for a PC game. The controls are extremely jank with mouse and keyboard, with problems such as your viewpoint being forcibly locked in place after certain attacks, temporarily locking onto enemies on it's own if you aren't using the lock-on feature, several actions that can't be rebound, (such as sprint, which seems locked to spacebar even if I want it on shift.) Not to mention that the instructions including all the menu options and tutorials exclusively show controller inputs, even if no controller is plugged in. All in all, this leads to lots of 'bullshit' deaths where it feels like you have no control of what's happening. Go pick this game up for PS4 instead, and pick up a copy of bloodbourne while you're at it to justify the buy if you need to buy a console to do that.",0
Negative,"I got a character to about soul level 100 ish and got the invalid save data message (soft ban).Deleted all characters to be sure.Days later I was penalized (hard banned) because of failiure to remove invalid data.Its a good thing I bought the season pass too huh?The game itself is good, but it sucks to be labled a cheater for nothing.",0

Negative,"The publisher shut down online play, and the game tries to connect for more than 30 seconds every single time you start the game until you disable online play.",0
Negative,"I love this game so much. I Really do. but i can't give it a positive review because of recent events. Server have been down for about 3 months now and The games are still being advertised as co-op, but they aren't anymore. It seems as though the Devs are not going to keep the servers going, which, don't get me wrong i understand to some degree, but this game still has a big, active fan-base, so it doesn't make sense to shut the servers down. unless. they are doing it to make people buy and play Elden Ring. The servers where shut down due to an exploit, but it was fixed very quickly. why are the servers still down 3 months in? There has been NOTHING from the devs regarding this except ""servers won't be online until after the release of Elden Ring"" and it just seems scummy and sketchy.There are some absolutely ridiculous people commenting defending the devs, asking why people are still playing Dark Souls 3 when Elden Ring is out. It's such a dumb comment because they are literally different games, with different achievements, bosses, multiplayer aspects and the maps are different. Just because a new game is released, it should force people to stop playing their older games. Stop saying these dumb things.It seems like once again, one of my favourite developers are just doing everything they can to make money, and screwing the consumer. I really hope this is not the case, but i can't give a positive until this is sorted out.",0
Negative,"No multiplayer for more than a month because vulnerability issue and no news when will they fix it or if they fix it at all. From the store they deleted it has multiplayer so I guess they don't plan to fix it soon.I haven't finished the DLC content so I wanted to finish it before I buy Elden Ring but I might wait with that purchase too. It has performance issues anyway. Please fix your games, thanks. We, as customers (or paypigs for some of the games), need to voice our displeasure if the game doesn't deliver what they promise. Please downvote the game if you are unsatisfied too because it's a great game but it's missing a vital part of it.",0

Negative,BEWARE! Hacker has taken over this game. I play all of the dark souls series and have more hr on some of them if you count my Xbox days. I have 200hr in dark souls 3. The game is amazing and I only recommend this game in offline mode only. But I got hacked when I was in the undead settlement and sent me to the very start. If you fight a hacker they will reset your save game and ruin your save game. They might be able to do other things on your system but that is not confirmed. Overall if you only play offline mode only you are going still love this game it might be my favorite game series of all time. If you still want to play online download the mod blue sentinels.

NO COST? and plus armor is among the easiest item to find in this game even in the first area 'the throne of the lord of darkness"" there is so much armor and it is incredibly high level, S rank or and all of the weapons do NO DAMAGE. you heard me right NO DAMAGE AT ALL. this is enickslusable for a game of this calibur, especaly after playing sekiro where you have so much damage and you can youse your sword to parry attacks and block intuitively. overall this game isgood but held back by rollback netcode and broken armor",0
Negative,"Don't buy right now. Too expensive for an 8 year old game. $60 for the game plus another $20 for the dlc. Servers are down, even though they said it would be fixed after elden ring was launched, which is hilarious because modders have already fixed the issues with hackers.If you're looking at getting this in 2022 and beyond, buy it on sale. Nothing less than 50% off, and use the mod that allows for custom servers. It's a great game beyond the servers and the price.P.S. I have nothing against a new game being the they're at, but an 8 year old game being this price is too much. It reminds me of Activision.",0
Negative,"Dark Souls III could have been a great game if it weren't for the invasions.Playing offline is fine, but oh? What's that? You just want to play online with a friend? Well, have fun getting raped in the ass by unwanted invaders! Hmm? You don't want to get randomly invaded every 10 seconds? Too bad. You don't have a choice.You're thinking: ""Well, I got invaded, but hopefully they'll at least be honorable."" Nope, they never are. They'll just keep running away, using the NPC enemies as backup because they're too bad to fight you on their own. They'll heal 15 times and keep running.It's a lose-lose situation; either you'll die and get reset to the last bonfire without your ember, or you'll finally kill them, having lost all of your Estus Flasks and even worse, 30 minutes of your life. Honestly, how the invaders get any ""fun"" out of this is beyond me.Maybe if PvP was an option that you could toggle on or off it could be fun, but suddenly getting attacked by ""Lou Sassole"" while you and your friend are messing around 5 meters before the next unlit bonfire (which you can't light until the invader is gone, by the way) is agony.Playing with a friend should not turn an enjoyable game into suffering.Don't get me wrong it's a fun game, that is, until you get invaded.So, to all invaders I would like to say: Please, do the world a favor, and off yourselves.",0

However, now a script for cheat engine has been leaked which allows cheaters to get you banned and destroy your character. On top of that having clean backup will get you banned either way.Fromsoft's anti-cheat measure is a lazy, outdated embarassment that ironically works against the players it's meant to protect.HOWEVER, if you don't care about the online and just want the pure pve experience then go for it, just remember to play offline.",0

Negative,"This game (and the series alike) is very overrated. Every aspect of Dark Souls 3 is subpar and uninteresting. It's the epitome of ""A mile wide and an inch deep."" Everything it does is done to a far better degree by other RPGs. The combat: Nioh 2 and the Ninja Gaiden Sigma series are games which have similar weapon variety but much more depth to it's combat mechanics. The most interesting the combat can get in Dark Souls 3 is pressing the attack button or the roll button. Of course you can block (lol) or use the special ability of the weapon which will be most likely be useless except for some standout cases. The combat is sooooo boring and watered down compared to any other ""soulslike."" The spellcasting is also very lame since you have sacrifice your only resource of health in the game for it, and bosses in the late game actively discourage that playstyle anyway.The World is also really boring as well. For a game where every boss is a named character and all your companions have these mini arcs, FromSoft has a really hard time making me care about any of them. Out of all the characters I think I only really cared about 2 of the nonboss ones. The ending is also so entrenched in the bad world building that it makes it hard for me to care about what happened in this world. Some of the bosses are interesting but a lot of them are really uninspired and if you have any familiarity with this type of game, you should be able to beat them pretty quickly. The exploration and secrets are probably the only thing that I think Dark Souls does well, but still lacking compared to other RPGs with not even half the budget.The most impressive thing about Dark Souls is that it's able to have very bare bones and watered down versions of all of these mechanics in one single game. A mile wide but an inch deep.",0
Negative,"So I've played a lot of this. And it's weird, after all this time I still wouldn't really recommend it to most people. My first gripe is the difficulty, which even with over 70 hours of playtime under my belt I usually find more of a hindrance to my enjoyment than anything. It's dangerously close to ""be perfect or else you lose"", especially if you're any sort of caster. It definitely doubles down on the one-shot kills too, which I always thought just killed enjoyment. It's not so much enlivening and pulse-pounding to me as much as annoying and draining. And not only that, but when it should be most challenging, envigorating, and memorable near the end of the game, it just kind of peters out, reusing old enemies and ideas over and over again. Semi-SPOILER the last non-boss challenge in the game is just a bunch of the same knights and soldiers you were fighting in the first few hours of the game, only more of them and with higher stats. And that's after an entire area filled with nothing but reused enemies. Ick. END semi-SPOILER.Now the constant difficulty wouldn't be so bad if not for my second and main gripe, that the game is massively, massively linear compared to previous entries in the series. There aren't even a handful of meaningful branching paths. Which is sad, because that was one of the saving graces of the series for me. For Dark Souls 2 when people would say ""oh I don't want to play it, I don't like games to be that hard"", I could tell them that at any time there are 2 or 3 paths they could take instead of the one they're on, so if something is giving them trouble they can try something else out instead, then get stronger and come back. It keeps it fresh and lets you avoid the frustration of just being stuck on a really hard boss that you're fricking BORED or ticked off with but that you just can't seem to beat. Well that whole mechanic is gone, dead. It's no longer a metroidvania game like the first two. With a few exceptions there's nowhere to really explore except the area you're currently in at the moment. And actually, with only a single exception the places where you can take branching paths are secrets, not even part of the main game. It's just a straight line from beginning to end. For me, that's a huge disappointment, and seems pretty lazy when they've taken time to do that in the past.So I guess I'd recommend it if you're 100% only in it for the combat, which is excellent, and the difficulty. If you mainly wanted a metroidvania-style tough as nails exploration game like I did, like the second one was, with a criss-crossing critical path and the ability to make meaninful choices about where to go next and not just get spoon-fed areas and bosses in a linear fashion, this is not it. Disappointing, and not recommended unless you're a masochist or simply a lover of the combat.*Update: I had the urge to retry this since the Elden Ring trailer came out. My opinion hasn't changed. I don't understand why anyone feels compelled to spend their time playing this. I think I've been sick of grimdark settings for about 10 years now, too, that doesn't help. I didn't enjoy Sekiro, either. I think I'm just done with this guy's games. I hope everyone enjoys Elden Ring.",0

Negative,"I personally enjoyed this game a lot, and I still do, but there are just way too many problems (major and minor) that seem to go overlooked for the longest time. While I understand that they want to completely forget Dark Souls 2's existence, they refuse to learn from the good that it did, while also completely getting rid of what made the original Dark Souls so popular; difficulty. Rolling is now based around spamming rather than timing, and considering the low cost, there's absolutely no drawback to mashing the roll button 20 times, as you'll regain your stamina within seconds. I could go on for hours over what's wrong with this game, but the most painful thing of all, though, is how they barely listen to their Western fans, almost always pandering to the East's. Even the Region Lock is essentially for Japan only, as there's only 2 real ""regions,"" Japan and Not Japan. Overall, I feel like they were more focused on releasing the game and getting the series over with (as well as pocketing all the gullible fans' money) rather than making the last game in a largely-beloved series the best one yet.",0
Negative,"Family sharing is disabled and all accounts are deleted. thanks Fromsoft for the information.But that is not enough for Fromsoftware:After 3 games they still use a P2P tunnel to connect the players with each other . for this reason it is easy for hackers not to be detected by the anti-cheat system (if any exists).Hackers can do a lot to your game too :D- Break all your stuff.- Hackers can force stuff into your inventory.- Break your save-game.- Permanently ban you from online servers.- They can all do, like a Game Dev, cause they dont get banned from the Game ! :D I cant wait to see what Fromsoftware will do in Elden Ring.",0

Negative,"Huge exploit is found and they just turn off the servers, can't seem to be bothered to communicate what's going on or and eta on a fix. Meanwhile modders had the exploit fixed in 24 hours and private servers are going up. This bodes well for Elden Ring right guys?",0
Negative,"softban ban The game is great,I LOVE IT,but every day i am so fear of being softban that I can't enjoy the game. The backup copy of a file will not work, if you need to reinstall the system,how to solve this problem? Do you like to play it again and again? It will be tired to dead, so I ask for the game company to improve the ban system, thank you!",0
Negative,"This is something of a sad thing to say, but I can't really recommend this game at it's current Price, or it's DLCs, not unless they're less than $30 at least.I'll try to describe in Detail why this game isn't very good, from both a PvP and a PvE aspect as best I can, so let's start with PvE.} Baser PvE enemies: In Dark Souls 3 PvE, the game at first, doesn't seem too different from many other games of an RPG Genre, very basic enemies staggered by your weapon, they don't have very powerful weapons or tools to defeat you with but you have to play careful or be overwhelmed, very fair and basic stuff, so it's not very much so worth getting into, what's really worth getting into is later-game, wherein enemies actually deal fair damage to you. In mid-game enemies still try to overwhelm you, though now they move much faster and their weapon strikes are almost always faster than yours, this can lead to unfair fights wherein if you begin to get over-tasked, you may not be able to get away before getting killed in combat because you simply can't move or the enemies lash out at you far too quickly for you to heal, this can be frustrating to deal with at first if you're going through the game alone, however this problem can be solved if you simply bait them out one at a time. In late-game, though there is a mix of a few newer enemies, for some reason they simply re-use the exact same enemies you fought earlier, only harder hitting and maybe a new technique or 2, but otherwise pretty well the same, any tactic you used on the enemies at the beginning of the game, which makes it ridiculously easy to simply walk up to them and smash your Light-attack button because your swings will almost always knock them out of any of their attacks, the only reason you'd have to stop is to regain Stamina so you can repeatedly swing your weapon again. This truly baffles me, as in previous games, from the Souls Series, I have never seen re-use of enemies on this scale, and likely for good reason, so as to make you learn new tactics for each area and make them more memorable. It is also very apparent that the tactic you use to beat Beginning level enemies can also be used to beat almost every enemy up until Mid-Game where they begin to get faster than you.TL/DR: Enemies are somewhat poorly made PvE Bosses: The very coveted Dark Souls Bosses. The bosses for Dark Souls 3 are mostly well made, save for some exceptions, which can be quite the annoyance or completely disappointing. This shor bit is going to list off some poorly made Bosses, so skip reading this if you don't want to be spoiled, but know that it's roughly 45/55 on how I personally feel about Bosses. #1 Deacons of the Deep#2 High Lord Wolnir#3 Yhorm the GiantLastly, #4 Dancer of the Boreal Valley This is just something of a detailed list of bosses that were poorly done but were mandatory, if they weren't mandatory they wouldn't be worth mentioning in my opinion.TL/DR: 1/4 of bosses are badNumber of Bosses/Time to beat: Discussing the bosses also makes it apparent there are less bosses than the previous two Souls series games, With Dark Souls 2 having a bare minimum of 20-16 bosses if you use Shortcuts and skips and Dark souls 1 having 14 bosses if you use every shortcut and skip device available to you. This is another point Dark Souls 3 has against it, considering 4 of it's 13 are unimpressionable bosses, which isn't neccesarily something I can say about about the others in the previous games. This can also considerably reduce the time to beat the game.TL/DR: Less Bosses than previous games, thus making game quicker to beatPvE and Combat:Another thing worth mentioning is that many weapons in PvE are unviable, the only things you'll usually every need are a Dark Sword or an Ultra-Great weapon, using anything else is usually more of a challenge, and you'll often see this is usually what people are using when playing Co-Operativley or during Invasions. This removes a lot of personality from characters, because not many people will sacrifice personal taste for damage, though every weapon should be reasonably good.TL/DR: No good reason for PvE weapon varietyCo-Operataive play and Host Benefits: Lastly, Co-Operative play and Host Bonus's in Dark Souls 3 makes it ridiculously easy. In regards to summoning: Now, don't get me wrong, this is true in every Souls-Game, however in this one, every enemy except for some bosses can be VERY easily staggered, meaning that if you bring 2 or 3 extra players into your game, you can usually just carelessly swing your weapon with abandon, as any enemy that comes into contact with a hit will be unable to move until they recieve a second hit, letting your and your friends keep whacking it in an infinite cycle. If you haven't somehow managed to kill it and your summons haven't taken the aggresion from the enemy, you have a large plethora of Estus and lots of Rolls to be able to survive almost anything, along with a 25% health increase to help you survive more lethal attacks. This in totallity means you can simply mow down enemies with your pals and never think about attacking Human-Sized foes and makes you sloppy at fighting bosses because all you've likely had to do is spam light-attack and you'll likely beat most bosses by summoning too.TL/DR: Summoning+Being a Host makes game no challenge at all A few other short things: Dark Souls 3 Re-uses a LOT of Assets from previous games.For some reason a some magics were added from previous games and others were not at all. Moving on to PvP Invasions: In Dark Souls, there is a mechanic unique to it that you likely won't find in many other games, the ability to invade and combat people during their PvE experience. This being said, Dark Souls 3 has pretty well ruined this mechanic, with the previously mentioned Host Benefits and Co-Operative play and the ability to also stagger Invading players like regular enemies, this allows the Host and his phantoms to have an overwhelming advantage against invaders unless an invader uses only combat builds designed to kill other players in a single hit (Also known as Glass Cannons). Also in Dark Souls 3 was the inclusion of moving while using the healing item Estus, making it nearly impossible to punish another player who has run away and is currently healing because they can just walk out of punishments. With all this, there is no good reason to Invade in Dark Souls 3, it's literally been ruined to an almost unrecognizable degree, especially if you've played the previous Dark Souls games.TL/DR: They've Soiled It Duels : Duels in Dark Souls 3 are okay, though there's clear superiority in what weapons you should use, and Heavy armor is absolutely pointless.Now, I know there are some people who might be wondering what some above average things are about this game, so let me give you a brief summary of those: ~Dark Souls 3 Positives~ Soundtrack: By Jove, the Soundtrack is amazing, even for some of the lesser Bosses, it really gives you a feel for what you're fighting and puts you in the moment. Art: This one is a bit generalized, but I mean things like the armors, the Backgrounds and some areas, which clearly have a goodly bit of detail put into them, some of these clearly have had a lot of work put into them. Good Bosses: Now I spent a good paragraph listing off how I dislike some of the bosses in Dark Souls 3, but there are some VERY good bosses in this game, that will no doubt enamour you (Make sure to do hidden Bosses if you do get this game) Wrapping up I'd love to go into more detail about some of these things but reviews can only be so long, so I'll just tell you my final score for Dark Souls 3 is a 5/10 and with it's DLC it's a 6/10. Again, I recommend buying it when it's cheap on price, or if you just wanna say you beat Dark Souls",0
Negative,"I actually held out a lot of hope for this game since Miyazaki was returning as one of the Game Directors, but I've never been so disappointed. For reference, I have played Dark Souls, Dark Souls II, and Bloodborne prior to this. I did not play Demon Souls or Scholar of the First Sin or any of the DkS2 DLC.This game is great in so many ways and improves on a lot of the features of previous Souls titles from crafting to unlocking spells, weapons, and other purchasables, and even brings the player back to a Dark Souls feel for combat and character control compared to Dark Souls 2, including the i-frames on dodge rolls not being nearly as few as they were in Dark Souls 2.All the praises I could give to Dark Souls 3 are unfortunately thrown out the window due to some critical flaws in the game's design. Let's start with some of your first experiences in the game.Minor Spoilers for the first boss fight, nothing story-related, but you've been warned.First boss, Iundex Gundyr - Pretty easy and very enjoyable first phase, really gives you hope for what the rest of the game offers. Second phase? Explodes into a giant black mess of goop that covers your entire screen and is near-impossible to read. I actually managed to beat him on my first try, but it required all estus flasks and I had a sliver of health left. This was a warning for how the game design policy had evolved, which I flatly ignored. I feel like I got pretty lucky getting away from that fight unscathed. It also helped that I started as a Warrior, so I had a decent health pool and good starting damage. My gf chose Deprived and struggled significantly more with the boss than I did.Early-Game Estus FlasksSo, they decided to carry over the DkS2 style of Estus Flasks, where you start the game with very few estus flasks, and it takes a while to build that amount up and certainly to, beyond that, make them effective with bone shards. I don't even want to imagine what it must be like as anyone who relies on FP because you also have to allot your estus flasks. Sounds like a great idea for late-game and PvP absolutely, but you're going to be very frustrated as many early zones feel like a game of attrition as you're trying to explore and collect all the items so you don't have to come back later after you're well past that area in the game to grab a few things that were probably more useful earlier in your playthrough.Especially with how much more damage enemies have started to do in DkS2 and DkS3, and many other BS things they added, your main concern should really be whether or not you can survive individual engagements or coordinated encouters such as ambushes, rather than worrying about your estus flask management in early zones. You will probably find yourself using homeward bones at least once in the first three zone before finding your next bonfire for the fear of losing all your soul progression.Enemy BS in a variety of formsLots of enemies have been designed to make the game unfair for you. While most people have a misconception about Dark Souls games, I recall Dark Souls 1 to be a refreshingly challenging experience. It was hard not because it was designed to be unfair, but because that kind of challenge was new to me. You're an undead fighting Kings, Dragons, and borderline Gods, you're supposed to hurt, but as my 5th grade teacher properly dichotimized the terms of ""hard"" and ""challenging,"" whenever someone would complain that something in the class was hard; Something that's ""challenging"" is by no means insurmountable, and something that is ""hard"" is not made to be broken, it's made to withstand every blow it takes.So, the first instance of some serious BS in the game is the black goop enemies you fight in the first zone, and occasionally further on in the game. Much like Iundex Gundyr, they take up your entire screen, but they also have massively wide arcs in their attacks and are near-impossible to read. Now, you can certainly kill these enemies before they explode into black gore and personified frustration, it was not something I was ever favorable enough to do, and some starting classes may have more difficulty than even I did in accomplishing this.Enemy Tracking is another great piece of BS they decided to exarcerbate in this iteration of the Dark Souls universe. Some bosses will share this trait as well, which is very disconcerting, but you'll notice a lot of enemies whose attacks will track your character during the entirety of the attack animation. This makes it very difficult to dodge or position yourself with dodge rolls or normal movement and is nothing less than artificial difficulty that will leave you tightening the grip on your controller every time you die to an enemy that will spin 180 degrees around towards the end of his attack animation to catch you after your dodge roll finished because you thought, as with every other Souls game, dodging early to gain a positional advantage and allowing yourself for a large enough window to punish enemies was the smart thing to do. Not in this game. You are forced to dodge roll as they complete their attacks, especially if you want to dodge the follow-ups which will also track you, and this makes your punish windows much smaller in this game for no logical reason other than to try and market the ""challenge"" of Dark Souls.Too Much Poise! A lot of zones will have some signature enemies that are made memorable for their challenge or unique mechanics. However, this neat concept is bastardized by making powerful or cool enemies, especially those with fast attacks and very little down-time between those attacks, have incredibly high poise. Even as an UltraGS user, I had difficulty poise-breaking a lot of enemies. One of the greatest examples of this are the Goat Monkey Fire Sorcerers in Demon Ruins. They can take a fully-charged R2 from the Profaned Greatsword and still retaliate without flinching.No Input-QueueingYup, no input-queueing. That's great, right? A step in the right direction for DkS3.except.it's not. Input-Queueing was actually insanely useful in previous Souls games. You just had to stop spamming and know that your character will do what you want it to. The importance of input-queueing actually exists in the reaction time it offers. Life or Death comes down to fractions of a second in Souls games, and input-queueing makes it so your input will activate at the next possible opportunity. As long as you know the game and trust your inputs and don't button-mash, you will be better than okay. In Dark Souls 3, removing input-queueing means you have to button-mash in order to react on the first possible frame. You know how you have to button-mash to get the roll or backstep at the bottom of a long fall to avoid the momentary stagger? Imagine doing that all the time on all bosses or enemies that combo you or poise-break you or knock you down, or.anything! It's very uncomfortable and, in my opinion and people may disagree, less skillful.Ironically, the only semblance of input-queueing is in dodgerolls. This was definitely one of the biggest peeves in Dark Souls 1, no pun intended, of anyone who played was the random dodgeroll. It's not quite as bad in this game, but if you try to dodgeroll an attack but get hit before the dodgeroll executes and are poise-broken, often times on boss fights, you stagger and then dodgeroll after the poise-break ends. This becomes a very huge problem because a lot of bosses in DkS3 are designed so that they combo in specific intervals to counter people who spam evade. The follow-ups last just long enough that they hit you after your dodgerolls ends if you dodge reflexively to being hit once. That is really smart and enjoyable gameplay, but when your dodge is queued after eating the first hit and you are forced into a ""reflexive dodge"" you didn't intend to perform, the boss gets 2 free hits of damage onto you, and then you could very well be dead.",0

ALWAYS BACKUP YOUR SAVEFILES SO YOU DON'T LOSE ALL YOUR PROGRESS. BEWARE OF ONLINE CHEATERS.This is simply one of the best aRPGs of this generation.

The lore, the combat and locations are simply exquisite.It has a high difficulty, alright. Some things feel like bullshit, but you'll learn and git gud.

For those that like it, by all means, go nuts, however if it has to interrupt and screw my PvE experience, then it's an awful design for those who simply do not want to PvP. I never had interest in PvP as over the internet, PvP has and will never be perfect over the internet. There will always be lag problems, and you're always forced to play and adapt in the moment you fight somebody. Yes, I'm quite salty with the game only for the fact of how PvP is designed to screw with people who don't want it.Every thread where people search for a way to not wanting to have PvP interrupt their PvE experience, it's met with dismissive comments of ""just dont ember"" or ""play offline"" with the follow up ""if u co-op, u have to pvp too"". Heard it all already, and I just hate it.I'd consider it a miracle if FromSoftware decides to change up a covenant that promotes co-op and blocks out invasions entirely. For anybody who is thinking to response with a work-around, unless it's a guaranteed co-op with no PvP invasions at all, don't bother.I like Dark Souls, and it's almost a perfect game, except for this one problem.",0

Negative,"This is my Favorite game, but yet i do not recommend paying such an enormous amount of money for this.i will be adressing gameplay, story as well as multiplayer in this Review.the gameplay on its own is very smooth, definitely the best gameplay you can have out of the entire Souls Series, not only very rewarding, but also very punishing, which forces you to take a deep look into Stats/Builds as well as good Attack combo's.For the Story, it's aswell the best one out of the series (//OPINION) it lacks guidance, which can be a real Problem for people who like simpler games, i recommend to play this only, if you're dedicated enough, or atleast have 1 friend who knows where to go, when to go. There are alot of side quests which are all worth the effort, aswell as 3 Endings.For the Multiplayer, and this is why i do not recommend this game, as soon as you use an ember, which gives you an HP boost so its preferrable to some people, you have no control over the multiplayer anymore, Family share got removed, but recently added again thanks to the massive shitstorm, which does suck in my Opinion, i didnt get it at first as aswell i was banned by a hacker back in 2017, so i bought the game again, and then i realized how the hackers have vanished, now i paid good money for basically nothing.This game does not Provide any gameplay Server's which means it always works via P2P, causing enormous amount of lags, and desync's which is in no way fun to play. at some point people even appear invisible and untouchable for you or the host, which is really frustraiting. Regarding the Hackers, People can just oneshot you outta nowhere, break your entire armour and weapons, and basically completly corrupt your game files, which means, do not enter multiplayer in any means without a save backup. Hackers can get you banned by basically anything.This is what Frustrates me the most about this game, the Multiplayer is not Syncron at all, people kill your from 100 yards away or are invisible and alot of other massive problems thanks to P2P.This game is a nice experience on the story and PVE on its own, but it really sucks comming to any kind of Multiplayer, and is absolutely not worth this amount of money.",0

Negative,"Dark Souls 3 Is pretty decent, Its an good game, BUT they messed up BADLY, when you can get stunlocked forever by RATS or Players using Longswords (stunlock you can't move whatever you do) And that poise literly does nothing. It ruins the fun of playing a sorcerer you can't cast your spell if you get hit BY ANYTHING, get hit by the weakest enemy in the game, CANCELED. Ruins it for Pyromancy, Sorceries, and Miracles. I really dislike this part of the game, other than that its a pretty decent game. Nothing compared to DS1 or even DS2. It just feels like Bloodborne 2 and not an Dark Souls game. I'm highly disepointed in FromSoftware.",0

Negative,"No steam sync is absolutely not acceptable for a game like DS3.After about 30 hours of first time playthrough (Yes it might not be alot for many of you) I lost all my progress after a power outage and this resulted in corrupt game files.The first time feel is what makes these games so special, and starting over aint it.And no, this ISNT my fault whatsoever. Not a single player should go through manually backing up game files just because the developer opted in to not integrating steam cloud sync.The game is GREAT. However Dark Souls as a franchise is literally one of the LAST games on earth that you want to see your progress wiped off by some stupid game crash/power outage etc.",0
Negative,"Good morning everyone, as you can see I have lost 110 hours of my life and existence that NO ONE will be able to give me back, especially those from From Software/Bandai Namco from whom I was banned in my opinion unfairly. The main reasons are 3: 1. Apparently if your saves get corrupted (as happened to me), you cannot fix this problem in any way, not even by uninstalling the game or trying to use file verification.2. Obviously the game does not tell you how you can fix this problem, and if your game is not in English, you cannot in any way have a warning message or the actual ban message. So until that time you will be in the dark.3. Obviously a normal person should be able to seek recourse to this injustice being that this game full of tryharders but especially CHEATERS as can also be seen from the LIST OF KNIGHTS (Leaderboard of the game) who can do whatever they want undisturbed. Instead people who want to play the game and DLC (just put on discount and bought and especially NOT REFUNDABLE) with their friends for a problem for which I cannot know the reason but can only speculate being that I have never done anything that can be traced back to cheating or exploiting in my very short life.I highly recommend anyone who does not use the game in the LANGUAGE OF THE GODS ENGLISH to change the game language to English right away which will allow you to come to grips with any problems.I hope that this review of mine can help players who have been having problems and who want to face the world of Dark Souls 3.Kind regards and many good things to everyone.ITALIAN PARTBuongiorno a tutti, come potete vedere ho perso 110 ore della mia vita ed esistenza che NESSUNO potr ridarmi indietro, Soprattutto quelli di From Software/Bandai Namco da cui sono stato bannato a mio avviso ingiustamente. Le motivazioni principali sono 3: 1. A quanto pare se i tuoi salvataggi si corrompono (come successo a me), non puoi in alcun modo fixare questo problema, nemmeno disinstallando il gioco o cercando di utilizzare la verifica dei file.2. Ovviamente il gioco non ti spiega come poter risolvere questo problema e se il tuo gioco non in Inglese, non potrete in alcun modo avere un messaggio di avvertimento o il messaggio vero e proprio del ban. Quindi fino a quel momento sarete al oscuro di tutto.3. Ovviamente una persona normale dovrebbe poter chiedere ricorso a questa ingiustizia essendo che questo gioco pieno di tryharder ma soprattutto CHEATER come si pu notare anche dal ELENCO DEI CAVALIERI (Leaderboard del gioco) che possono fare quello che vogliono indisturbati invece le persone che voglio giocare il gioco e i DLC (appena messi in sconto e comprati e soprattutto NON RIMBORSABILI) con i propri amici per un problema per cui io non posso conoscere il motivo ma posso solamente ipotizzare essendo che non ho mai fatto niente che sia riconducibile a cheating o exploiting nella mia brevissima vita.Consiglio vivamente a chiunque non utilizzi il gioco nella LINGUA DEGLI DEI cio L'INGLESE di cambiare subito la lingua di gioco in quella inglese che vi permetter di venire a conoscenza di eventuali problemi.Spero che questa mia recensione possa aiutare i giocatori che hanno avuto problemi e che si voglio affacciare al mondo di Dark Souls 3.Cordiali Saluti e tante buone cose a tutti.",0
Negative,"Note: This is not strictly a negative review, but more about not being able to recommend the game.Dark Souls 3 is a hack and slash type of game with character building familiar from role playing games. This game is more difficult than many of it s peers, but the difficulty is alleviated with frequent checkpoints and the possibility of freely leveling up your character, which requires some grinding, but nothing too much.The game s strongest point is it s atmosphere and abstract story that is told in a very shrouded way. Even though the graphics are quite average for an AAA-game, the world with it s monuments and points of interest are sight to behold. What most pushes you forward in this game is the thrill to see new places and wondering what has happened to the so shrunken world around you. Exploration is possible due to levels that are nonlinear and are very well designed in general. Unfortunately Dark Souls 3 s weakest point is the combat, which is pretty much the core of everything. The whole package consists from two things: leveling up and gearing your character and fighting monsters and bosses. The role playing elements are done fine enough and there are different varieties to gear and arm your character and how to acculumate skill points, but the combat feels often unpolished to the point of frustration.In this game are three combat moves you never want or be able to use: The first is a kick move that needs way too precise timing with pressing two buttons at the same time to pull off. The second one is a dodging move by pressing one button, which is never advisable to use because you ll just get hit. The third one is a backstabbing move which you perform behind an enemy, but it also requires way too precise movement and aim to be counted on. To add there is a jump you can utilize outside of combat which is horrendous to use, but is gladly almost never needed in the game.So you have three moves you can t use and then you are left with swift attack, hard attack, blocking and dodge roll. These are all the moves you have in this something over 50 hour game that consist almost entirely from battling monsters. Pretty weak, huh? The dodge roll is what you need the most and will be spamming all the time in every fight you cannot breeze through with one hit, so no variety to be found in the fighting mechanics of this game.The frustraion part comes from enemies attacks that visually don t get you, but you still take damage, and vice versa. Very often with regular enemies and in every boss fight you will encounter many hits that get you even though you clearly dodged them and hits that got you, but no damage is done to you. Maybe even more annoying is the fact when you perform a dodge roll, but it s interrupted by an enemy hit: After your character rises up and you think you are in control again, then the protagonist does the roll and you usually suffer more damage from this. Sometimes your character won t block, won t use an item or won t roll if you precisely do things in time. It seems you often have to do things a little bit early or a little bit late to make them work. Combat controls should be very tight and precise in a rather difficult game like this, but the case is they are unpolished and somewhat clunky.Then there are some technical issues like the camera blocking your view in some areas and especially with large monsters. If you can t see anything, you cannot fight properly. The game may rarely crash, bugs occur, it has a framerate cap of 60, it has not many PC specific settings and looks quite outdated for a game released in 2016. The lighting and shadowing are poor and textures are often muddy, what together makes the game look very old sometimes. Tearing is a problem for players who would mitigate it with high refreshrate and don t want to enable vertical synchronization. Audio is not very crisp or detailed and there is no hint of any good use of echo, positional audio or any clever modern enchantments. You need a controller to have any decent time, because controlling with keyboard and mouse is completely overlooked.In the end I had some memorable moments with this game and I completed it, but I honestly can t warm-heartedly recommend this game, since the combat is mechanically so limited and has frustating issues what should have been ironed out, but it seems this game was more or less rushed out. The larger audience won t like this game due to difficulty, but if you are into challenging hack and slash type of combat in a mysterious gray fading world, then you should try this out, hampering gameplay issues and poor techincal execution aside.",0

Negative,"In many ways, Dark Souls III is a blatant over-correction of its predecessor, in part for better but mostly for worse. DS2 was an ambitious undertaking that sought to add further depth to the Souls formula, but it ultimately fell apart due to extremely inconsistent areas and bosses (the massive scale didn't help), janky controls, and bewildering design decisions that aggravated the playing experience instead of adding to the difficulty in any meaningful way - ADP determining estus drinking speed and invincibility frames while rolling, making the Fire Keeper the only way to level up, and so on. While a handful of these issues would stick around, DS3 did fortunately address some of the most egregious problems. However, there is a caveat: FromSoft did this by using their more acclaimed titles - DS1 and Bloodborne specifically - as a crutch for the lore and the gameplay respectively. The result is a title that lacks its own identity and often puts players at an unreasonable disadvantage due to mechanics that are ill-suited for the challenges on offer.Before I proceed any further, I want to make one thing abundantly clear: if you want to play Dark Souls III, it has to be for the gameplay. Flawed as that aspect is in its own right, there is still more than enough to it for someone to enjoy the game on that merit primarily. I say this because the story and lore are just about worthless. DS2, for all of its problems, is about as appropriate a sequel as you can get, as it takes the themes of the first installment in a worthwhile direction by emphasizing the undead curse as the central element of its setting's literal and metaphorical degradation. It had some references to DS1 (some egregious ones too, considering the Old Dragonslayer), but they were sparse enough so as to give the mere implication of a cycle, in the sense that Drangleic is either an iteration of Lordran that has become near unrecognizable with the passage of time, or a kingdom built on top of the ones before it. Its ideas did not always work, but the end product was still a respectable shot at something new.The same can not be said of DS3, a work that not only relies heavily on 1, but attempts to justify this by bringing the cyclical nature of the Age of Fire to the forefront, as if the endless NG+ of 1 did not already convey that idea. This redundancy is so ubiquitous that it harms many other important aspects of the game: locations and bosses are often rehashed from 1, if they're not outright recycled (Anor Londo is easily the most insulting case of this pandering), and the same can be said for most of the items, weapons, and armor pieces you will find. Rarely does the game ever explain why all these references are here, and when it does, the justification may well contradict DS1: if linking the First Flame means you stay alive and become a Lord of Cinder, doesn't that completely undermine Gwyn's sacrifice in 1? What about lore elements such as the pygmy lords or Gwyn's firstborn being a dragon sympathizer, both of which lack any real development and come off as nonsensical big twists for shock value? The most absurd incongruities aside, the game comes off as almost entirely devoid of creativity, and even when it does bring new ideas to the table, their intent is to look cool instead of adding to the themes of the series.On the flip side, the gameplay has more than its own share of flaws. In all honestly, DS3 easily has the best control scheme in the trilogy: as good as 1 already was in that regard, it still had some quirks (for one, Jump uses the same button as Roll), and those are absent here. The problem doesn't lie in the controls themselves, but in the fact that they're rarely appropriate for the enemies you face. As an attempt to live up to the Souls series' unfortunate reputation as ""the hardest game franchise ever"", 3 takes a page straight out of Bloodborne and elects to make most of its enemies hit faster and harder than ever before. Yes, you're a little faster than the previous games and you can roll more often, but your movement, your attacks, your weapons, and your spells work in just about the same way, and yet the game prioritizes speed through its challenges. Many builds that were once perfectly viable are now irrelevant: the absence of poise (a couple of frames when attacking with a handful of weapons is practically nothing) and the ability to fast roll with up to 70% equip load highly encourage rolling as your main defensive tool, whereas spells have been nerfed to oblivion so as to balance PvP, not to mention the absurd choice to make pyromancy reliant on Intelligence and Faith. In Dark Souls III, the most important thing to have is high DPS, meaning that weapons such as the Longsword are much more viable than most of your other options. Even if you go for an optimal build, mind you, enemies will still generally hit harder and faster than you can, and they get to have poise too. Add enemy mobs, high aggro ranges, multi-hit combos, and bosses with multiple phases (you can see some of Sekiro's worst boss design habits in Sister Friede's three-phase battle), and you're likely to find a few of these encounters unfair. The game as a whole is still doable, yes, and you can play in co-op quite easily thanks to many quality-of-life improvements to the multiplayer (albeit at the expense of its value as an extension of the setting as with the previous titles), but even if it's still doable, something has to be said for the fact that it leaves so little room for a less experienced player to bridge the gap between their skill and an area or boss' difficulty. Dark Souls, in spite of its advertising, is not that hard, and part of the reason why is that the player has many ways to adjust the difficulty. If they run out of flasks halfway through a section, they can kindle a bonfire to get more; if they can't stay alive long enough to beat a boss, they can level up or upgrade their weapon/armor. As with its predecessor, Dark Souls III further limits the player's ability to tweak the difficulty (to cite one example, you can't upgrade armor anymore), and this becomes aggravating when many of the options that it does offer are clearly inferior to the ""DPS and rolling"" meta. There has always been a gap between the least and most viable builds, but it has never been as wide as it is here. Once again, even if you play according to the meta, you are still generally at a bigger disadvantage than you would be in previous installments. Only a handful of encounters work in harmony with the game mechanics, and that is because their design takes much more from the Souls games than from Bloodborne (Slave Knight Gael, Champion Gundyr, and the Abyss Watchers, incidentally the three best bosses).Dark Souls III is mediocre, but most importantly, it's unnecessary: one can grow to appreciate the gameplay in spite of its flaws, but there is little to appreciate about levels, bosses, and lore that depend so much on a previous installment that they offer no real surprises of which to speak. Dark Souls II definitely had worse low points, but it also had interesting locales and a fair amount of satisfying bosses, some of which stand their own with the best from 1. At its peak, 3 is merely good, and just about everything it does well has been done better in the previous titles. While I have no particular inclination to play 2 or 3 again, I would find much more value in revisiting the former than I would the latter. I can only recommend DS3 to those who are desperate for more Dark Souls and/or interested in the gameplay alone.",0

If you haven't played this game, but you've played the others this game might be worth it on sale. If you're wanting a souls experience for the first time I would recommend Dark Souls Remastered or Elden Ring to start. Elden ring is brutally hard too, but the curve builds and the game is a masterpiece. DS1 is just the GOAT. Honestly, I'll probably put another 40 hours or so in this game because I'm mad about it.

Negative,"I love this game and its single player experience is excellent, but let's not mince words here; do not play this game or any other From Software game online unless you are using a console device. I will be saying as much on my reviews of all other games I own from this company, including but not limited to:* Dark Souls Remastered* Dark Souls II: Scholar of the First Sin* Dark Souls III* Elden RingThere has been an RCE (Remote code execution) exploit possible since the release of the Dark Souls games that can have potentially catastrophic effects for PC players. This has allegedly been addressed in private for several years by some parties directly to From Software (still looking for a good source on this one.), and From Software's response has seemingly been to avoid publicly addressing the issue (and apparently, not fixing it as evidenced by a later event) until it was basically banging on their door as Elden Ring was right around the corner. Elden Ring's PvP servers have come online and remained online without a hitch, in spite of any potential issues that may arise.Even after From Software addresses this issue, this flagrant disregard for the trust of the PC userbase has made me wary of playing the games online. Get it on console. It's not worth losing hours of gameplay progress or having ACTUAL, SERIOUS CHANGES made to your computer.Elden Ring's servers are online, but to my limited understanding the servers of Dark Souls 1 Remastered, 2, and 3 have been down since January 2022. As of May 2022, the Elden Ring servers are online. I do not feel safe playing online on PC. Namely, it is that the other servers are currently down, which was the company's initial response once statements started being made publicly. That they have not been brought back online tells me that the issue either still exists or has been given a bandaid.",0

I havent had any graphical problems nor have i had any major crashes, for the most part it runs extremly well and looks beautiful!Graphics-8.5/10Gameplay Offline-7/10 (I prefer the invading of others, and jolly co-op) Gameplay Online (wo hackers)-9/10 Pc Controls- Work very well!Overall-8.5/10 The hackers ruin the fun for all.HOWEVER being flaged for having invalid data worried me. I was ask to promply remove any invalid data from my pc. I had no idea what was wrong i just got the game so then I unistalled the game completly and and reinstalled again the next day, no saves were kept everything was removed 100%. Well then i got the message as soon as I got on my DSIII again. Started to freak out a little, but then I thought maybe it was a warning that would go away as soon as the next update hit ( after all i did what was ask and removed any and all invalid data from my pc!) I was 100% correct that message disapeared! ALONG WITH MY ABILITY TO PLAY ONLINE.

Sometimes I can find them, sometimes they screw me over, each one makes me roll my eyes and wears on my patience. Bottom line is, it's not the fun kind of difficulty I've come to expect. This is just tedious. The first Dark Souls challenged and made me want to overcome. The second one I joined the Bell Keepers and PvPed so much I burned out before moving on with the game. This one I've tried again and again, and failed to find a reason to bother continuing.Dark Souls spawned a great genre, and now the newer games are overtaking this series, using the foundation it has laid to innovate and push the idea further.

Negative,"Dark Souls 3 is a great game, and arguably has the best PVP scene out of the series.However, until FromSoft and Bandai get the servers brought back up I can't recommend this game.Planned obsolescence is the calculated act of making sure the existing version of a product will become dated or useless within a given time frame.",0
Negative,"Impossible to play in coop, I don't even know why it's in the tags. More often than not (in our case 4 times out of 5) you will be invaded by someone 5 times more powerful than you are after 3-5 minutes of coop. It's an absolute nightmare, we won't continue playing for at least 3-4 years, when the game will be dead enough so we can play coop without always getting invaded.",0
Negative,"A game relying on quick reflexes and timing during combat. Users (including me) can confirm there is constant stuttering and the game freezes regularly since the last patch (App Version 1.04.1). This is not how you make a game hard, this is how you make it impossible to play and enjoy.",0

Negative,"one of the greatest, elden ring lite",0
Negative,"family sharing disabled, can't play any more. doesn't even make sense, 1 and 2 are still shareable. stupid",0
Negative,"Major security flaw RCE (Remote Code Execution), when you get invaded or playing with random people in general, that is being around for some time and only got patched because it chould potentialy impact the new release, Elden Ring, as it shares the same networking features. Through it, a hacker chould steal data, take control of your pc and even render it useless.",0
Negative,"The stuttering makes the game unplayable to me. FPS drops (60FPS->3FPS->32FPS->60FPS->1FPS) seemingly random, even with a good computer, but very often when an enemy attacks. Just got killed by two dogs because of them. Nice. Multiplayer is broken as well.",0
Negative,"As a huge fan of DS series I enjoyed playing this one too. But I can't recommend it. There are enough positive reviews so I'm gonna focus on the downsides.First of all, If you haven't played any games in the series, obviously start with the first one. DS1 is awesome. If you have already played DS and liked it. then I guess this one is worth a try. Now, in my opinion, overall it is the most boring game in the series. DS3 encorouges players to spam roll and R1s instead of developing clever tactics of stamina usage (DS2 did it far better in my opinion). Level design is surprisingly linear compared to previous games. I don't know whether it's bad or not but DS3 overuses mere-exposure effect (PLING PLING PLONG). Ah, there is also the community. Well, I was lucky to play first 100h without any problems. But now I am on the shadow server. And I don't know why. So, I guess no more DS3 for me.",0
Negative,Cheaters ruined online and you can never play with friends.Luckily I've only started a new save but it ruined my friend's first experience! The FIRST invasion was a hacker it's infested with cheaters that will ruined your entire save permanently and probably get you banned on the dark souls 3 servers with hacked items they forced on you.If the first invasion was a cheater i can't imagine how more there are.Why are people getting a broken game when they buy this.I purchased this game at full price and this is what you give me?We need private coop.Please learn from me and my friends experience and save yourself from these problems and go play offline.I'd give this game a bad review if i were you. Obviously they do not care what we want.Sad that you probably can never play with your friends again. But HEY! At least you can play offline! And that's pretty fun i guess.,0
Negative,Don't buy if you want to play multiplayer. Looks like they aren't bringing it back. Single player is fun tho,0
Negative,This game sucks all you do is swing your gay ass sword like a twink,0
Negative,"No button prompts besides xbox display, I had to download a mod in order to show keyboard. How can you port without the simplest of GUI changes?",0
Negative,"It is so fucking bad. do not play this ""Dark Souls"" Play dark souls 1 or 2Darksouls 3 is dogshit",0
Negative,"this game should come with controller delivered to pc users. because all tutorial is written in gibberish, you hve to sipher all controls from what like would mean lb which is like shift plus left mouse i still dont know if its true cuz all hour i been opening menu for controls to try to see what is what, i cant get through tutorial boss thats like 5 mins gameplay that took me 1 hour, how can i return this game? and get funded back?",0
Negative,"Good game, but sadly I cannot recommend it. The anti-cheat system is atrocious and hackers can ban you from playing online by just hitting you. The anti-cheat system likely won't be fixed as the previous entries in the series has had similiar problems, and the developer has done little to nothing about it.",0
Negative,"way too hard for me, also i have the mental capacity of a 5 year old so that could explain it",0
Negative,apparently this game is worth $10 for every year its been out,0
Negative,"DS3 is finely put together, and it's Dark Souls, which itself is enough for most people, and its allright. At the same time, I find DS3 the least interesting and appealing game of the whole series starting from Demons Souls. There are different arguements coming from different groups of people, each one saying their own version of why one DS game is better than all the others.Some say, online. Other say - sheer complexity of level design, yet another group of people will point out boss design (obviously, dudes in amor in DS2 etc).I belong to a group, who likes DS2 the most since, of course, DS1. A part of it has a lot to do with online, which the first one couldn't really provide at the time, and DS2 was much improved at this direction. Lots of armor and weapons, many styles to try and combine - idk, I haven't got through DS3, maybe the later is better in that regard. But somehow the most important for me, classic action/adventure/exploration-kind-of-guy, are locations.And of course DS2 locations weren't really even remotely as complex geometry and verticality -vise compared to what we have in this game, but somehow most of them were memorable and interesting. And here goes the usual Iron Keep counter-arguement. But Forrest of Fallen Giants, Shrine of Almana even the Drangleic Castle and many others - they all had their own feel, distinct look, secrets and a place in lore, that in combination with other aspects made you want to know more about it. And they stuck with you.And DS3 - which is my personal problem, I guess - is mostly a case of ""yet another"". Yet another abondoned city, yet another place where they've disposed of hollowed, yet another cathedral-like building, yet another catacombs etc etc etc.To an extent my problem comes from the visual department too, because most places in the game look dull and grey, and nothing stood out for me in their looks and their feel.On all the other fronts DS3 is basicaly a safe sequel, which mostly gives you more of the same gameplay. Yep, there are some minor improvements here and there, some little new game mechanics, but there's no real progress, which doesn't help my situation.Each time I struggled to make myself play the game a little more, and I just couldn't bear it for more than an hour and a half at once.",0
Negative,Most overrated series of all time. Keyboard/Mouse port is as terrible as usual.,0
Negative,"i am using a keyboard and a mouse, what's up with all the controller buttons? are you that lazy or are you just discriminating?",0
Negative,no steam cloud save - watch out,0
Negative,The other Darksouls are better. Nothing but PVP arenas.,0
Negative,"Good game but I can't recommend it to anybody right now as multiplayer has been removed, which is such a big part of the game. It is a shame as I came back to play this but it feels incomplete without player interactions and jolly cooperation.",0
Negative,"Dark Souls III: Prepare for Impressively Vague Patch Notes and Nonsensical Multiplayer Management!At the rate of how this game has been patching recently, I can't recommend it until it has reached it's final version for a clear verdict of a final and possibly perfect product.Yes, it's a great game and, if you love the previous games, this game is perfect (it hits every note almost perfectly); if you're in it for the single player, then, by all means, get this game!However, it's stupid having friends being banned and then unbanned for things they did not commit to doing and then having friends who are STILL banned for having been harrassed by the actual hackers who, MIND YOU, are still getting away with it! Some of these people are those who contributed to the wiki pages and guides for Dark Souls 3! This is including that all those involved in the production and management of this game still lack the senses to properly inform the audience and customers in relation to these issues. Like. Really? How are they fixing it? Adjust? Adjust what? Look, another innocent got banned, did you adjust for that to happen or did your adjusting do nothing?It is to the point that hackers are getting popular highlight in YouTube now with one of them having live streams - receiving money for having fun and for literally getting other people banned.I will change this review for when the time comes that the developers and publishers get their head straight for multiplayer as it's one of the core aspects of the game but, until then and especially for those coming for the multiplayer. NOT RECOMMENDED.",0
Negative,"> Be me> Play 100 fun hours with a positive review.> Leave the game feeling good with the time i spent in it, yes including all the retarded pvp shenanagins. I played the game legit unlike many players i saw with world-size shrek faces and whatnot.> Get back on MANY months later to play with a friend> Game data supposedly invalid, 'online activity impeded'> Can't seem to be able to connect with my friend and play together> Delete all my saves, all game data (including roaming), fresh install> Sorry i guess we saved it on our servers that you're a naughty player> Gee thanks BandaiI think the phrase is something along the lines of; ""Go forth and multiply""?",0

Negative,"It's a great game, but this initial release is riddled with technical issues. Wait for a price drop, or an optimization/bugfix patch, or for the inevitable ""All of the Game"" Edition. I'm leaving a negative review in solidarity with the people who got unjustly banned by malfunctioning cheat detection, though I was lucky enough for it to not happen to me.Back up your save files regularly and if you ever encounter a hacker online, alt+F4 out of the game and load your backup immediately.",0
Negative,This game is a console game that has added a few keyboard controls and mouse support. Its not a lot of fun on a PC,0
Negative,Game keeps crashing and theres no fix for it,0
Negative,"The gameplay is great, a step up from Dark Souls 2, but the crashing is a constant issue throughout the game.Always it crashes near bonfires and I'm now at lowest possible settings, still crashing. PVP is impossible if a bonfire is within 20 feet of your character. Also the ""Knight Fix"" is more of a might fix, but it won't solve your problems permanently. I am at the 4th boss fight and bonfires are still crashing it so this is a global bonfire issue. Your only saving grace is that there are so damn few of them that you can easily avoid them.What's got me concerned is Namco's lack of a response, not even an acknoledgement to the problem, so this might be a significant bug which will go unfixed.",0
Negative,"Dark Souls 1 and Demon's Souls were hard, Dark Souls 3 is pure cheapness to a level that the Turbo Tunnel from Battletoads looks easy. If you like completely unfair crap ranging from fighting hordes to fighting guys who would be good mid-game bosses in the starting area, get yourself sectioned and still avoid this load of tripe. In Dark/Demon's Souls if you were fighting more than 2-3 dudes you screwed up or they all went down in one hit. In DS3 you are either fighting 4-6 dudes who take multiple hits to bring down or guys who would be tricky for late-game characters who were plonked in the first stage. Dark Souls 1 had Black Knights dotted around the early zones, but they weren't mandatory, respawning, and there was only one in the zone. So avoid this big pile of cheap dog crap and just play Dark Souls 1 again or Demon's Souls. They are far FAR better and less full of raw cheapness. There is a difference between difficult and cheap, and DS3 worships cheapness with more fervor than any human could ever muster for their religion.",0
Negative,"Online doesn't work anymore, which makes some things much more obnoxious than they need to be. A shame too because otherwise I had lots of fun. ""Fun"" of course being dying horribly to lots of scary monsters until, eventually, managing to kill them. Hooray. Sadly I have to give this a negative because of that online bit, which makes leveling up certain covenants a MASSIVE pain in the ass without being able to engage in jolly co-operation. ;_;",0
Negative,"I've tried my best to get into it, given it several attempts over a fairly long time-period, but cannot deal with the abomination that is the PC KB+M controls.- There are no PC button prompts, and you have to memorize what ""controller buttons"" map to the ""PC buttons"". Mostly just an annoyance, since there's only 10 buttons or so to remember, not that hard.- The camera is abysmal, there is extreme mouse acceleration, and often times the camera will fling around for no reason.- The 8 directional movement hinders gameplay. If they had any consideration for PC controls, they'd have added an option to use your mouse to orient the character, and have AD strafe.This game needs a strong controller only recommendation, because even though I'm sure it's technically possible to play with KB+M, it's so terribly implemented that it might as well not be there.Even if the game is great, not properly supporting the primary input methods for a platform it's releasing on, is enough to warrant a negative review.Finally, the framerate being locked to 60FPS is another annoyance, but at least it's not 30.",0
Negative,Just first impressions but is it really that hard to make the tutorials show the keyboard versions and or the playstation controls because i cant use the xbox controls for shit and having to memorize every control is pretty annoying to have to do as the first thing in the game,0
Negative,"Another poor console to PC port. I got the impression this was the better of the three Dark Souls.Playing on PC, with keyboard and mouse. first give away is that default bindings for Dash/Dodge, and Jump. two separate functions. are both bound to the Space bar.Movement with the mouse is actually quite good and fluid, the latency of the game accepting input from mouse buttons and keys pressed though. unacceptable.There's a difference between skill based timing and just poorly coded delays. The code flaws are not twitch friendly.Maybe this is a controller only title. if so, good luck to you. But if you give me an option for greater accuracy to use a mouse and keyboard and screw it up, prepare to be judged on that level.What little combat from low end enemies I encountered, in my limited time. felt satisfying. I can see why this game is popular. But the first boss. spamming dodge and not actually triggering a dodge roll. stoopid.Two other horribly lazy port qualities. All tutorial/tip prompts are XBox controller based. Press X button to do this. Press A button to do this. The ingame menu is also labelled all with these directions. that's fine on XBox, but you ain't on XBox anymore.Try and quit from gameplay? You've got to go through the settings menu to the last tab to do it. and how does Quit work? Basically like resetting a console. load up logo screens, then the main menu comes up. Anyone that knows anything about games, not code, just games. that's SUPER LAZY.This is a very popular game, and the 3rd one around. yet still they put zero effort into showing some respect for the PC market. Just a shameless dash for cash relying on blind gamer fanboy praise.Other console games have been ported to PC properly. smoothly. Go to the top of the food chain and look at GTAV. console game through and through, and 100% playable on PC with a keyboard and mouse. AND it plays well. There are quite a few others that have been ported nicely.Dark Souls 3, is not one of those titles. Just like the first two.Maybe this seems excessively harsh for so little time played? Yeah, maybe. But the input response was slow, which makes the combat feel slow, which then makes all the other flaws even more glaring.I for one refuse to support sloppy and/or broken console to PC ports. Like the first two Dark Souls. Uninstall and ""Hide"" from my library, never to be played again. Too many better games out there on PC.",0
Negative,game to hard can't get past first boss,0

Negative,Network has been off for a while and even now that it's back it keeps going back down.,0
Negative,At any other time i would absolutely recommend this game but currently there is a problem with rampant hackers invading and forcing items onto your character that will get you banned.Since the game is no longer being worked on/updated the multiplayer portion of the game will be unplayable due to these hackers.,0
Negative,"By the time DS3 was in development, FromSoft knew that their core audience were the hardcore gamer types, and so DS3 panders to them at the expense of everyone else. The mechanics have been set up in such a way that ""get good and dodge roll to victory"" is the only viable strategy:- Armor is meaningless, as long as you have something in each slot, it doesn't much matter exactly what you have- Poise might as well not exist (it only triggers on very specific heavy attacks)- Sorcery is garbage (so many things are resistant to it)- You can't upgrade armor (not that it would help even if you could)- Shields are almost worthless (you can block 2, maybe 3 attacks with a high-stability shield; you can dodge roll 7 times in a row with default stamina)- Most enemies and bosses come at you with ridiculously long combos, so you have to dodge roll or your guard gets broken- When your guard gets broken (even by kicks to your shield) you can now be riposted for extra humiliation- More enemies and bosses have grab attacks that are less telegraphed and have shorter windups compared to previous games- Many of the grab attacks enemies/bosses come with now involves very long lunging or dashing movements so simply getting out of melee range isn't enough; couple this with the very short windup and these attacks are unnecessarily hard to dodgeIn DS1 and DS2, some strategies were more optimal than others, perhaps, but you always had options. There were multiple viable ways to progress past any given roadblock.DS3 wants you to play it a very specific way, and if you don't want to learn how to dodge roll everything? Screw you.It's not even a terribly creative game because it's loaded front to back with references to the last two games (mostly DS1). And those references aren't creative; as soon as you see one start, you know exactly where it's going.The world design is also extremely linear. The only two times the path branches, the 'main' path will have a wall requiring you to beat the side path first in order to progress. Compare this to the 'hub and spoke' of DS2, or the deeply interconnected world of DS1 - it's another symptom of the designers wanting you to play the game in exactly one intended path.I prefer DS1 over DS2, but they're both good games. I cannot say the same of DS3, and I don't recommend it to anyone, except maybe people who enjoy speedrunning Souls games.",0
Negative,"Do not purchase this game until the servers are back, the game is not worth it without its online features.The servers are still down after two months of inactivity, proving that Bandai Namco and From Software don't care about the community of players that has supported them for many years.",0

Negative,"Played the game for over 400 hours, faithfully never even installed cheat engine, despite ever use it. Got flagged as a hacker despite never hacking, and got banned for no reason while people who shoot pontiffs from a short bow continue to roam free. 10/10 working as intended.",0
Negative,"Is probably a great game, as is evident by the sheer number of positive reviews. However, this is not made for mouse & keyboard play, at all. Every tooltip in the game is for a controller, and playing this with M&K is an exercise in frustration. Navigating through menus is incredibly counter-intuitive, as pressing enter or spacebar does nothing in menus. Character creation was clunky as hell (cannot use mouse to drag sliders, pressing enter does not confirm your choices, etc.)Great game made incredibly frustrating by 0/10 console to pc port.",0

Negative,"Ive got to say I love the souls series but From has completely abandoned this game for dead. The base game is good and all and playing through it a couple times is fun for a new player, but the longevity of the game pvp or co-op is horribly unbalanced. Its riddled with players who don't want to play the game for fun and only want to win - if that's you go for it. But be ready to use one of only a few types of weapons otherwise you'll end up on the receiving end of stunlock via a dagger that takes 1/4 your health per hit or a straightsword that does about the same.

Negative,"DARK SOULS III IS AN AMAZING GAME! But, there is one glaring issue; about 3-4 days in of relentless grinding, my account recieved an error message stating that I was ""hacking""/""cheating"". Because of this error message, I could not summon anyone, or be summoned into anyone's world. It doesn't end there, however, because even after that my account became corrupt, and I was forced to restart all of my progress. What I am trying to say here is that Dark Souls III is an amazing game; the graphics are stunning, the frame rate is steady, and the gameplay is smooth, but it pains me to say that with issues that force you to restart all of your progress because of ""hackusations"", I cannot recommend this game to anyone(at least until this issue is resolved).",0

Still a terrible Soulsborne game.",0
Negative,"Yeah this is one of FromSoft's worsts. You might've heard someone say Ds3 has the best boss fights in the series. Which is undoubtedly true, there's few bosses in any other game that are worth writing home about. What they don't tell you however is that the boss fights are almost all it has going for it. Watch anyone playing this game and you're bound to see them just sprint through the whole area. There might not be a single good area in the whole game. Colors are incredibly sparse, for aesthetic purposes yes but it makes for a very dull experience. I hope you like grey. Nearly every enemy in the game is also like a mini boss for some reason. Imagine if all the enemies in Stormveil Castle were Crucible Knights but they were still placed like regular enemies.You'd be forgiven for not realizing it if this is your first soulsborne but a disturbing majority of the game is just fanservice. I hope you like going ""oh it's firelink again"" or ""oh it's another shrine handmaiden"" or ""wow there's gwyndolin"" because you'll be having these moments to an annoying degree. Think if every area had its own Patches/Moonlight Greatsword. It's almost thematic how soulless the game feels compared to its predecessors considering the dying state of the world lol.Dark Souls 3 is also railroaded to hell and back. Ds1 has one of the most impressive and interconnected maps of all time, Ds2 was like a 12-pronged fork that you spawn in the middle of, Ds3 is literally a hallway. This is not a world to get lost and explore in, this is a guided tour.Lastly, the multiplayer. Ds3 gets praised a lot for removing the ""jank"" from controlling your character but I actually think it works in the game's detriment, at least for PvP (which is crazy because the PvP scene here is also the most active). You're so incredibly agile that trying to hit someone with any sort of spell or strength weapon is hopeless, and stamina management has become such a non-issue so you'll frequently find people spamming rolls with little to no consequence. PvP in Ds3 is absolute garbage.If you want to play this game, play it after you've played a couple of the other soulsbornes. Definitely DON'T buy this game at full price.

Negative,Anyone who gives this game a positive rating is a fanboy with no sense of what a well made game is. The first MAJOR issue is the keybindings.

Negative,"It is a great game, but the hackers are out of control. I have to look at a hacker warning every time I start the game, but nothing gets done about all the cheaters on DS and DS3. I was recently invaded playing DS3, and as soon as it happened my computer glitched and I immediately started with the same character on new game +. I had only killed one Lord of Cinder. Such bs.",0
Negative,"Couldn't motivate myself to finish this one. It just lacks a certain something that Dark Souls 1 had. The world is almost entirely linear, so you'll largely be left with only one path to follow, which in turn makes it less of an RPG and more of just an action game. The bosses are more annoying - not necessarily harder, the difficulty is about the same, just annoying - than in the first game. An example would be Crystal Sage, who has magic resist through the roof, seemingly only to annoy you for choosing a sorcerer. That's not hard, it just means it takes much longer to grind him down.The quest mechanics are poorly thought out. I'd like to see anyone finish more than maybe one NPC quest playing this blind - the triggers don't make much sense, or are placed so you'll only ever come across them accidentally if not following a guide.This has also lost a certain ""groundedness"" that the first game had. Let me give you an example; if you meet a humanoid enemy with a sword, in the first game he'd likely to have regular sword attacks, maybe some acrobatics. In this one, said enemy might anime-fly into the air and dive at you. Not jump, fly. You cannot, in other words, predict an enemy's attacks by their visual design at all. It sounds like a weird complaint, but the amount of information how an enemy looked communicated in the first was pretty good!Sure the combat is still perfectly fine and all, and the graphics are pretty good, but. I'd not spend money on this, unless desperate for more Dark Souls. Maybe on a steep sale?",0
Negative,"600+ hours I really wanted to like dark souls 3. Sadly as it stands now it has nothing on offer that isn't present in other souls games. Hell, the other souls games pulled much of what Dark Souls 3 does better. It's a shame truly seeing as Dark Souls 3 seems to be a mishmash of improvements from other games put into one: You can use multiple consumables at a time, the menu can be brought in and out of focus to give you a better look at your character, the menu flows and controls smooth as ever and is rather intuitive, you can walk around while doing guestures, and you can cancel the guestures at anytime with a simple roll or backstep. However, where the game succeeds in accessibility and general flow it loses in replayability and balance. The games balance specifically in terms of pvp is rather lack luster compared to other entries. Many weapons in similar classes have the same or similar movesets with only one or two different movesets being shared in classes. This turns the balance and competitive nature of the game into a simple game of, ""What swings fastest, has the most range, and does the msot damage."" The most comon meta weapons used are as follows: Carthus Curved Sword, Gargoyle Flame Spear, Hollowslayer Greatsword, Yhorm's Great Machete, Astora's Greatsword, and Washing Pole. These are the staple 'meta' weapons mostly due to their consistent ability to deal damage with relatively low skill needed. ""So what?"" I hear you say. The weapons for pvp aren't balanced, ""I don't play these games for the pvp anyways"" , fair point and while those weapon restrictions might not diminish your enjoyment of the game as a whole, the lack of replayability will. Both Dark Souls 1 and Dark Souls 2 had thought up solutions to the problem of the game getting boring after your first playthrough. Afterall, you keep all your weapons when you go into NG+ and most enemies in the first few NG's don't put up much of a fight. In Dark Souls 1 the solution was the Gravelords, a pvp covenant that would, when triggered, would add red phantom enemies into the players world and a random summon sign of a Gravelord. The player Affected by the covenant would have to kill a Gravelord in order to reset their world. This idea expanded into being the default state of NG's in Dark Souls 2. Enemy Placement would be changed slightly and red phantom variants would appear through the world, not ground breaking but it kept things interesting and the player on their toes. With the lackluster balance, poor replayability, and From's inability to communicate with their own community. Dark Souls 3 is just a game I can't reasonably recommend to people. If you want an enjoyable pve experience Dark Souls 1 or Bloodborne are your best bet. For an enjoyable and varried pvp experience I'd highly recommend Dark Souls 2 (I have 1000 hours worth of gameplay in Dark Souls 2 if that's an indicator.) If you do wish to buy the game, I'd suggest waiting for a sale of 30 dollars maximum, as that is about how much the game is worth.",0
Negative,"Beside all the fps drop and the fact that I need to play with a 800x600 resolution in some areas (I don't even got a shitty pc, I can play The Division @720p without any fps issue, so yeah ? wtf ?)This game is just a medley of Dark Souls 1 and 2, simply a nice copy paste of amors, weapons, mobs, areas, movesets.And don't get me wrong I'm a big fan of the souls series (especialy Dark Souls 1 of course.) but this game feels empty in the end, basicaly a Dark Souls (Bloodborne Remix) and that sucks =/I'm sure it's not that hard to understand that I played with weapons / armors for more than 100hours in the first games and I don't necessary want to play with the same weapons and armors in the new game ! ;) (or kill the same bosses / mobs)Oh and btw I really can't recommend it now since the multiplayer coop is kinda broken and well.

Negative,I'd like to say i can thumbs up this game but if i had of known that the whole HUD layout would be console buttons i wouldn't of bothered buying it.

This was a game breaker for me unfortunately not knowing any PC controls and having to continuously check the key binds in settings to try figure it out. and all game hints being displayed with console controls - and before anyone comments 'just plug in a controller' I don't actually own a console controller so that isn't an option for me.,0

Negative,"I have platinum for DS3 on PS4 so game time for PC is not an accurate representation of my actual experience with the game. Overall it's an okay souls PvE game but the PvP atm is just bad, so bad that I don't think they can fix it even with DLCs and patches because the problem is not specific weapons but the game mechanics. People like to complain about poise (and they're justified most of the time) but the most serious problem is rolls being too cheap. The reason meta weapons all have one or two relatively fast attacks is that it's just much much easier to roll catch and if you can't roll catch you can't do shit in PvP, both in invasions and duels.It's the end of the series, and they fucked up the one thing that'll keep people playing for years, just so some newcomers can have a slightly better PvE experience.10/10 WORKING AS INTENDED.",0

Not everyone has to be good in PvP and the creators didn't do anything to prevent the spoilage of the PvE content - more over they made a penalty point system for trying to avoid invasions via shutting down the game (that includes power shortages and sudden dissconnections) - and gave you one in like 14 hour chance to reset that via the way of white butthole. Perfect system. If you want to enjoy the game as it is - never EVER turn on online mode.You made a claw that lets more people into the game - why not make an item that prevents invasions for those who want to enjoy the game with friends?

Negative,"A disappointinly linear game with poor balancing, a very short campaign, and watered-down mechanics that promotes running from enemies over fighting them. If you're a long-term fan of the Souls franchise, you could squeeze some enjoyment out of all the shameless fanservice (such as some areas being completely recycled from previous games without it making sense lorewise), but if you're new to the series you should check out Dark Souls 1 (for the worldbuilding) or Dark Souls 2 (for the gameplay) instead.Some important points:-PvP invasions prioritize co-oping players, ruining the experience for both parties.-The Poise system has been removed, making big cool-looking weapons much less useful, especially in PvP.-Item infusions has been split up in a myriad of different types and must be unlocked separately, most of which make the weapons WEAKER overall.-One area is reused three times as separate areas with no changes to layout (Firelink Shrine, Untended Graves and Kiln of the First Flame).-The advanced high-poly rendering shenanigans makes the game run poorly even on high-end machines, especially in multiplayer.-The Ashes of Ariandel DLC is much shorter than the three DLCs made for DS2 with a mere two bosses, and nothing suggests the second will be any better.-The overall game design prioritizes punishing the player over putting up a challenge to overcome, with ambushing enemies lacking sound cues and several areas presenting several new enemies at once so that it's not possible to learn their patterns in a safe environment.-The emphasis on running away makes cheap tactics in PvP matches way too rewarding.I've played around 80 hours of this game but wished I'd stopped at 10.",0
Negative,"Great singleplayer game, but the multiplayer functionality, at least for cooperative multiplayer, is terrible.A friend and I got this game thinking that it would be an interesting multiplayer game. However, in order to even get multiplayer going, you must first beat the initial boss. Of course, having no prior Dark Souls experience, defeating the first boss took us quite some time, over 2 hours. After we both beat the boss, we figured out where to go so that we may begin attempting multiplayer. Once we were able to set up multiplayer, we quickly found out that when one player is a ""phantom""(Meaning that they have joined another player's session), they cannot interact with the environment much, other than attacking enemies, and that the ""phantom"" leaves the game after death or completion of the level, which means a lot of souls have to be spent in order to keep the ""phantom"" in the game, especially early on.Basically, the ""phantom"" is merely assisting the other player and benefits almost not at all by doing so, making the game quite dull. At least I have another singleplayer game now.

The game is too linear, you can choose from two branches every now and then but you can't go too far out of the way. The whole game looks grey, and all the armour looks the same. The bosses are all pretty cool, but not every boss needed phases.There's no build variety since most stuff is locked away in the linear late game, weapon arts are mostly generic, no power stancing, armour and vitality don't matter since poise is non-existent, all the rings barely have any effect, magic is too weak, most covenants are pointless or broken.Co-op with friends is finally easy, but invasions are next to impossible because of infinite rolls, infinite seeds, infinite summons, but only 5 talismans.

Negative,"I'm surprised I haven't reviewed Dark Souls III, considering my strong feelings on it. There will be spoilers.TL;DR: Good action-rpg, bad Dark Souls.DS3 is a huge disappointment and a horrible ""Dark Souls"" game. That is not to say that DS3 is a bad game in itself. In fact, it's pretty fun and can offer good challenge, it doesn't have any game-breaking issues, enemy designs are fine, game doesn't suffer from hitbox issues that plagued DS2 nearly as much (though it still does have bad hitboxes in a lot of places). If you are simply looking for a fun action-rpg, then DS3 is a great choice. However, overall gameplay in it barely feels like Dark Souls, and is much closer to Bloodborne.The story in the game is yet another repeat of linking the fire theme. This is pretty funny to me since I still remember how people were very annoyed with the fact that DS2's story was a rehash of the original, with the player being forced to kill 4 great beings, and yet DS3 does more or less the same thing, but everyone was fine with it. The amount of fan pandering and overall fanservice in the game is also off the charts. Half the time playing it I felt like developers were constantly trying to get me to feel something by constantly throwing stuff from the first game at me and saying ""hey hey remember that character / area / covenant / boss"". This can work in a few places, but not when the entire game is like that.Level and world design are a mixed bag. On one hand, level design itself is pretty good. Levels are pretty big and open and offer shortcuts and different challenges, with Cathedral of the Deep probably being one of my favorite levels in the entire series with its level design. However, the world itself is incredibly linear. Unless you try to kill the Dancer of the Boreal Valley first, which is quite a challenge at low levels due to her attacks mostly one-shotting you in the beginning, game progresses in a linear manner. When you hear that you have to kill lords of cinder, you'd imagine that game would probably allow you to choose to fight them in any order you like. However, instead the game forces you to kill Abyss Watchers first, then locks the access to Irithyll until you have done Cathedral of the Deep, and only in Irithyll does it give you a choice of either going after Aldrich or Yhorm first. You might say ""but you just mentioned that you can kill Dancer early and get access to a different area"", however, you can't actually kill the lords of cinder that reside in the castle, since access to the archives is blocked until you kill all the other lords. As the result, your progress through the game is likely to be more or less the same every time, which is horrible for replayability of it. Technically, you can access the Ashes of Ariandel DLC as early as Cathedral of the Deep, but it's considered a late game area and not the ""intended"" way to go. Not to mention that doing DLC doesn't actually progress the main story.The gameplay is where my main issues with DS3 lie. Dark Souls III has the worst build variety of all souls games to date. Dark Souls 1 allowed you to make pretty much any build and, with the exception of a few areas or bosses, it would work. Dark Souls 2 expanded on that by making crossbows and bows much more useful and adding power stance, which further expanded your choices. Dark Souls 3 however has the worst build diversity by far, and developers clearly intended for the player to be a dodge-reliant fast hitting character, with every other build coming with huge tradeoffs. Magic has been nerfed into the ground and is pretty much useless due to requiring mana, which is replenished by the same estus that you use to heal, and due to stronger spells not really being worth it most of the time due to the amount of mana they require. Most people respond to that by saying that magic starts getting better after you increase your intelligence to ~60 or so, but by that point you'll be at more or less halfway point of the game. Magic can be useful as a tool in addition to your melee build, but a pure sorcerer has never felt as weak as it is in here. Bows and Crossbows now come with a limit of 99 arrows / bolts that replenish from your storage at bonfires, which limits your options severely, and the game's overall faster pace makes using them unpractical. You can carry and use different types of ammunition, but it's still worse than it was in the past. The nerfs to poise also make tanking builds impractical and more of a self-imposed challenge. They are not as bad as magic and can be fun and viable at times, but they are completely outclassed by dodge-heavy builds with fast weapons. Blocking attacks, especially from bosses, is also no longer a reliable way of avoiding damage at all. This has been an issue in DS2 as well, but in DS3 shields might as well not exist at all. There are some good additions to gameplay, namely, weapons now have ""weapon arts"", special techniques that can be utilized with specific weapons. For example, daggers allow you to use quickstep, which allow you to quickly move around foes, straight swords can break the opponents guard, katanas can either do a lunging attack or a parry from Iaido stance, etc. These moves also utilize mana bar, so it's not absent for people who don't use magic at all either. I am also not a fan of how embers and leveling up works. When you are embered, you gain additional HP and can summon people / be invaded. This is fine and I like the health reduction mechanic, however, problem is the same as in DS2: you can reach the boss fog and then pop an ember to become human, summon people and go kill the boss without any danger of being invaded. Leveling is annoying because of the same issue DS2 had: game constantly forces you to return to the Firelink Shrine to level up at a specific NPC.The music is also a mixed bag. On one hand, the tracks in the game are very good and much more memorable than the mediocre soundtrack of DS2, which is interesting since it was made by the same person. However, the tracks are also very similar to each other. Most of the tracks are grandiose orchestral pieces with choir singing along. While this is of course an oversimplification and might imply that the soundtrack is bad (which it isn't at all), all I'm saying is that the soundtrack ends up very repetitive. There are some tracks that stand out from the rest, such as Deacons of the Deep, Dancer of the Boreal Valley, Abyss Watchers, but for the most part they are very samey. Each track is not that bad on its own, but when entire game is pretty much nothing but grandiose orchestral performances, it all starts to blur together. In fact, you can open the soundtrack yourself: , and randomly click in the middle of each song. Chances are, they'll start blurring together really fast, especially songs towards late game. Graphics and style are fine for the most part, I don't have any issues with those.While this review might come off as very negative, this is simply because I'm focusing on how much the game, in my opinion, fails as a Dark Souls I sequel. This doesn't mean that the game itself is bad, but for me personally it was a huge disappointment. DLC is fine if you get the season pass. Ashes of Ariandel is very short and doesn't have much going for it except for the fight against Sister Friede, but Ringed City is pretty good both in terms of length and quality. The gameplay complaints were aimed strictly at the PvE experience with occasional invasions, not at the PvP-focused experience with constant dueling and such.",0

After sometime playing i got softbanned by cheater forcing items into my eq so i created alt account played there for 800 hours today i wanted to play some ds 3 i noticed i cant play it forces me to steam store i restared steam nothing worked i cheacked checked internet for solvation i found information about ds 3 disabled family sharing so i lost 800hours of my life i cant get it back only option is to spend second time money to buy the game again. This change will kill comunity that is slowly dying and only thing saving it was community who was making mods PvP improvnets now you cant play without a risk of getting banned on main account.I recomend buying the game for new players but beware ds 3 will be not the same game anymore.I m sorry for my bad english i hope you will forgive me. :p,0
Negative,"game was pretty good. played back in 2016 on other platform. But you should not spend any money buying this game. Why?Because 8 years old game still with 60$ price tag without steam ""cloud saving"" feature. Basically people like me buys game on steam to have this kind of useful features. But bandai namco & from software decided not to add any steam cloud saving. Because this would cost them some extra bucks. They don't wanna spend a little extra for that feature for players. But they like to keep the price tag at 60$ even after 8 fucking years. Yes with sale they still charges 42$ for a 8 year old game without steam cloud saving feature -_- this is outrageous",0
Negative,"game looks like it was made in unity engine with ported assets stretching from dark souls 1 and animations from demon souls (released 2009). everything has this weird greasy look to it making this game look unfinished and gross. the enemies are all two trick ponies that spam attacks and are very easy to kill if you just wait for them to stop sperging (dont worry they fixed this in elden ring so that they just read your inputs lol).level design is boring, ugly with scenes that don't come across as making sense in the slightest. miyazaki has this fetish in ds3 with pasting these rock balls everywhere or making giant cliff faces composed entirely of these objects. if you have played dark souls 1 you have already played this one, there is nowhere in this game you haven't already been besides this one area that actually has a blue sky in it. people who say this game looks good prioritize lighting effects and desaturated unity engine gfx. the game feels like a giant asset dump of unfinished and unreleased graphic designs mashed into a giant conglomerate of random zones and enemies with zero correlation. there is no semblance of a story, nor did they even attempt to create one, there's just random item descriptions with vague concept ideas hence nobody really cares or should. they just put in whatever they could, gave it 60 fps, ported in some assets from earlier games and called it dark souls 3. the fact that people rate this higher than dark souls 2 is beyond me, as they didn't even try to create something new in this or even try to finish the game. this feels like it was made in less than a year and it probably was.gameplay wise the rings are all terrible and provide minor buffs, the weapons are all boring with 3 categories (straight swords, greatswords, halberds) making up 99% of the pvp, with losers offhanding thrusting swords or other roll catching 2 frame attack weapons for maximizing button mashing after doing running attacks for 15 minutes straight. all the armors are useless once again as they don't actually reduce damage at all, nor provide poise (its a useless stat that doesn't do anything at all). you can't invade people unless they have a phantom, the arena is full of min/maxing tards that can't do anything except parry bait, running attack and offhand weapon switching so they're all automatically terrible and you're wasting your time trying to prove your better; its like trying to prove that you're better at fighting against a guy using a shotgun by trying to kill him with a knife, you might actually be better using a knife than he is but he's got a fucking shotgun, you can't really defend against a shotgun with a knife. sure he might slip up and miss after a very long time and you can close in and kill him, but that's entirely dependent on whether he screws up, it's pointless all together and you shouldn't be trying this encounter at all. if you're trying to PVP in this game honestly like it's some honorable duel between two people using greatswords and axes, you're going to run into this comparison very quickly when you realize how easy it is to abuse the hitboxes of certain weapons.the bosses are extremely boring and easy; and the game is really short. all upgrade materials are sparse for some reason and you have to spend hours grinding for a 50 point damage increase. souls are also sparse and lacking, creating some artificial sense of longevity. people that loved this game hated dark souls 2 for the same reason. they just wanted to play the same easy dark souls 1, with some extra goodies created in an art studio after 10 minutes mixed with some random new flashy spells. they didn't want any semblence of a story, they just wanted to r1 r1 straight sword another 10 foot tall lanky guy who spins around, then fight a big fat tard boss that can't turn around in less than 40 seconds. they didn't want new mechanics, interesting story, new animations or new zones. they just wanted to play the same game again; and after bloodborne everyone thought about just how good a new dark souls game would look if they applied a FRACTION of the amount of effort they put into that title. turns out, they literally did apply a FRACTION of the amount of effort into this one, and this is what you get, a game they didn't want to make but were forced to, same as elden ring. the only plus I will give this game is that it lets you cut most of the bullshit and kill the dancer pretty early, allowing you to ""farm"" for upgrade materials pretty early on and not dragging on the game for hours longer.this game is the souls equivalent of a marvel movie: very shallow, looks like dirt shit, isn't attempting to be anything new, was made in less than a year, and is extremely boring and forgettable. this entire game looks the same, feels the same, and is worth a lot less money than its price tag for how short it is. this game was released in 2016 you're paying 60 dollars for this over 6 years later, and that's not even counting the DLC.",0

Negative,"Unfortunately, the weakest entry of the three Dark Souls titles.If you are new to the series, and have never had hands on experience with Dark Souls - DS3 will tide you over, as it's a thematically rich experience to journey through.As someone who's followed the series since the Demon's Souls days, and got invested after playing Dark Souls 1, I've watched and experienced the many twists and turns the games have taken over the years, to fulfil the ""What makes Dark Souls"" niche.This is a view that, as a whole, absolutely differs per person - so this will mostly be a summary of the game itself + a few general tidbits.- Mechanics introduced in DS2, got outright murdered in DS3; notably, they have reverted your left hand, back to an offhand akin to DS1. No more power stancing, or 2 movesets at a time by wielding a weapon in each hand.- Invasions/CO-OP is counterintuitive; if you wish to enjoy this game with company, especially assuming that your co-op partner, or 1 person in the group is new to the game, and you plan to escort them through their own, well-paced experience - Good luck. Your world will be bumped into a priority queue for being invaded. People who tend to invade usually have a somewhat decent or solid grasp of the combat mechanics - it doesn't sound terrible at first for the multiple zones you'll encounter this, but soon the tedious nature of it all kicks in. It isn't just one invader. The moment you may get done vanquishing your first guest, 2 more take his place. I understand why this may have been done, but it unfortunately discourages any means of cooperative play, if it's anyones first experience, and they're not down for playing on nightmare difficulty.On the flip side, your incentive for invading can be equally problematic, as you'll usually end up in a world with a host accompanied by 2 or more power houses by default, though the outcome and whether this is a problem, varies depending on who you are. I won't go into what it does to your resources.- It somehow manages to have some of the most bland tilesets of the 3 games.DS2 has some very random tilesets, with little effort made to bring them together, but at the very least, I enjoyed the zone-esque approach of A-to-B-retrieve, that the game went for. DS3 feels like a mesh of snakes, that takes you to a bunch of environements, that are mostly connected via caves, doors and flight, but despite being so vast and relatively lively, it also feels like nothing is going on at the same time, once you've cleared the areas boss, you're done. There's nearly no reason to re-venture the grounds, unless you ignored or couldn't reach an item of sorts. In brief, I didn't feel as if I could care, or be excited about a new area in DS3, the same way DS1 & DS2 managed to pull off with their unique teams.It's a shame they didn't mesh the teams that worked on the first title and DS2/SotFS - an ultimate mish mash of the quality mechanics and feel of DS2, with everything that made Dark Souls hit the good feels with fire in DS1.DS2 highlighted the poor qualities of DS1, and improved them, mechanically. It fell short in the field of atmosphere that DS1 provided, but ultimately ended up being the better playing title.DS3 mostly comes straight out the door from DS1, adds a couple new mechanics, but fosters nothing memorable or useful from DS2 - so you get a very hit or miss title where, if DS1 blew you away, and you want something else similar to it - DS3 may sate your needs.But if you enjoyed both the first, second & additional second title, you may feel the areas in which DS3 lacks, more likely than someone who was heavily in favour of the jank, unintuitive nature of DS1, rubbed and polished in DS3.",0

Negative,"Bloodborne 2 Dark Souls 3 is an odd title.It sells itself as a souls game, but it doesn't really feel like one, and I think that's my issue with it.The big change to note in Dark Souls 3 from the rest of the franchise is the pacing of the combat. Enemies are fast, faster than they've ever been, sometimes even faster than they were in Bloodborne. The player character has also sped up, but not anywhere near the same degree. It's very noticeable that you're just at a plain disadvantage, and it doesn't feel good.The visual design of the game is rather drab. It feels like they were going for realistic graphics, but everything has a weird plastic appearance to it. There's also some incredibly bad texture work in areas, I'm talking N64 levels,. The game definitely has some truly beautiful displays, but in 8 out of 10 cases it's sort of unpleasant to look at.The sound design suffers too in a similar way. Usually it's fine, and some of boss tracks in particular are stunning, but there are a good number of sound effects that just feel low quality.The level design in the game ranges from good to tragic. The levels are generally ok, and none of it is great, but you'll often find yourself in a situation where you wonder ""Is that a bonfire I see 50 feet from the bonfire I'm standing at?"" and the answer is ""Yes."" The game is sort of just silly with this kind of thing. However, I want to note one big problem I do have with the levels: holes. There are a LOT of holes in which you can see beneath the map. Sometimes things were just placed poorly, other times there something else clearly needed to be placed. Bricks just not fitting together or walls having gaps that shouldn't be there. There are enough of these instances that you don't have to go looking to notice them.The world interconnectivity is where I start to take a real issue with the levels. There are a couple branching paths here and there, but they block things off with a magic wall, teleport you instead of connecting the world, and spawn a key only when an objective has been met. It's all very lazy and in no way reflects the self-direction of the player that these games are praised for.Dark Souls 3 is a tragic story. It's very clear that it's development was on the backburner while the main focus was on Bloodborne, and it hurts. The lack of polish, even after all the game's post-release patches, is very evident.",0
Negative,"This game turned me off in 20 minutes. And it is not the gameplay or the looks of the game that turned me off.It's the FACT that you REQUIRE A CONTROLLER to do alot of things in the game.

Something as simple as a kick cannot be mapped to a keyboard/mouse.It's disappointing that this is nothing more than a bad console port.",0

Negative,"This game is so good and i keep playing it. if you want to know why i give a negative review because of some problems that they didn't fixed in this 5 years and in many aspects not good as previous games.AlsoGraphics has lots of improvement and art design done well.Great music.Bosses looks so cooler.Good side quests.Very nice voice acting.has more than 2 endings.Covenants that really work.Multiplayer is not dead.Dark Firelink shrine which i think is vision of not link the fire is, was good idea.ButGame not optimized well they wrote at least you must have a GTX 750ti to run this game on low graphics on native resolution but on even 720p resolution you can't reach more than 50 fps on most of the areas in other hand left area before lord of cinder that bonfires before ringed city i had 20-30 fps and 30-35 fps on 800.600 resolution.Long boss fights, every boss has 2 phases and some of them in any phase has different HP bar and in a DlC a boss had 3 phase lol. Actually they can be easy but Time is your enemy when the fights take too long you lose your more Control on battle. I hoped they make it hard in other aspect not on time.Magic (pyromancy-sorcery-miracle) is useless in pvp.No soul memory system. sometime you see a guy invade you and kill with dagger in 2 hits.Most of the bosses have more than 5-hit combo if you made a mistake you mostly die.Normal enemies like hollow solider or lotheric knights and . they looks like have infinite stamina if you receive any damage they keep hitting rapidly.Bonfires are so close or they are so far and kinda impossible for normal players to reach and only experienced players know it is better to speedrun to a far bonfire. Look at second bonfire of ringed city distance to the third.The first thing is that DS3 doesn t have as many viable builds as many players would like, decreasing the quality of its re-playability significantly, the DLC largely fixed this with many good weapons, but it s nowhere near as good as DS2 in this particular way. Most of weapons in a same type like the great swords and ultra great swords have same combos.Sometimes i expect they forgot to design this game for dexterity.After passing he lotheric castle any most of normal enemies deals more damage than bosses.No poisoned crossbow trap in chests.DS3 removes Hexes.DS3 adds the worst fashion souls.DS3 ruins magic making it drawn your entire stamina bar.DS3 cast magics so slow in a fast-paced game.DS3 removed blue eye orb and add sinners.Ancient Wyvern was a joke. A massive joke.Repair powder is joke, equipments won't get broken.Toxic works as poison?Old iron demon has a combo that if you get far make a circle of fire and it get closer to him and no way to rolling or passing it without receivnig damage.No Bonfire Ascetics.Blue Sentinels and Blades of the Darkmoon doing the same and counting towards the same rewards.And something may be Good or BadFast-paced gameplay, now everything happen faster like rolling, sword play and ectIf i wanted to choose i liked DS2 physics or Lords of the fallen i'm not good too much in fast-paced games but you might like this depends on you.Overall: 8/10",0

Negative,"I've bounced back and forth with this game for a bit where sometimes I hate it and other times I just like it. When my character is new sometimes the new start can be fun but I am very quickly reminded how tedious this game can be. The vast majority of the enemies are not challenging but rather an annoyance. It starts to feel like they are just there to slow you down rather than being a fun fight. I've gotten really tired of running through the same areas in souls games. I'm tired of Poisoned swamps, of reused characters, or art assets being copy pasted it's just getting boring guys. None of the enviorments feel fresh to me, it just feels like a big ol copy of the previous souls games and that isn't fun.Add onto that the people who are getting flagged for cheating without good reason as well as the crashes that people keep experiencing and I have a very hard time recommending this game. I try to think ""What in this would justify the price?"" and I can't think of anything.Granted as I say that i've noticed that i'm at 108 hours already with the game not even being out for two weeks. One would think that would mean the game is enjoyable. To a certain extent it is but usually i've treated the game as a background thing, something to do with my hands while I listen to a podcast or something. When I sit there without something something else going on I am bored out of my mind. Same thing with Civilization when I don't have something else going.In brief , the game is kind of boring, it is not anywhere near as hard as people make it out to be if you have a good shield, the art is lazy, the locations are boring, the anti-cheat is banning people without reason, the magic is pretty damn weak ( save for pyromancy) and it's just more of the same. So I guess if you really want more dark souls there is that. If I hadn't had a friend buy it for me I think I would be a lot angrier than I am now.Oh I almost forgot, the pope outfit is a saving grace in this game.",0
Negative,"I tried. I truly did, but I just don't get it.How did this game become a genre unto itself - ""Souls-like"" - whooooo!No - I'll pass.While this game has its charms, gameplay-wise, I personally wouldn't rank it over the likes of The Reckoning - which was, to me, more enjoyable, and possessed more fluid and accurate combat system. I get it, some people like to die a lot in the games they play - and that too has its charm. But for me, lifetime gamer, understanding that the point of the game is to kill you easily, I look for, and only think of, timing. I, myself, probably didn't die as much as most (truthfully, I didn't die once, not even at the first Boss). But what I did experience was lethargy.With an open-world, story-rich, character building experience like The Witcher 3 out there, I fail to understand what made this worthy of its own moniker, ""Souls-like"". For me, The Witcher 3 set a bar far more worthy than this glorified dungeon crawler.Apologies: I understand how loyalists take it personal when their fav is critiqued harshly; but this title is not - I REPEAT - IS NOT the 'creme-de-la-creme':The graphics aren't polished enough (especially for such an acclaimed and AAA-priced title)It feels lethargic and desolate (because the world feels empty somehow)The movement is clunky-feeling, and the program's desire to control the camera adds to that clumsiness (and this auto-reset feature [that you cannot disable, btw] I surmise was a component they kept in order to make it ""difficult"".smh).The menu navigation is old-school and also is not fluid, and.I can go on, but I won't. Bottom line: For me, this was not immersive, it only made me sleepy; it was not difficult (just always be ready to feint an attack, before whatever enemy goes into a 3 strike attack, then hit); the camera controls suck; the character controls are stiff and goofy. It was just a huge disappointment.Amalur: The ReckoningWitcher 3Skyrim, and others have this game beat by a long shot and are far more worthy of their own 'Tag'.(""Souls-like"" - gimme a break.)EDIT: (I don't know why my hours aren't updating. anyhow.) One last mention: Horizon Zero Dawn. What a beautiful and immersive experience! While it doesn't bring anything new to the genre per se, it does incorporate all the best elements of an RPG decently well, and also manages to remain captivating, in both lure and visuals. Though DS may have an alright lure, journeying through its ""boards"" feel very desolate. Anyway just wanted to recognize another TRULY OPEN WORLD game who's polishing far exceeds that of the DS ilk. Now. it's time for a refund.",0

Negative,"Dark Souls III has to be my favorite game of all time. That being said I hate to give it a negative review. Currently on steam I refuse to review this game positively. After less than 50 hours total I have encountered at least 15 or 20 so hackers, I wish I were exaggerating. I hate to see the game in this state but it is close to unplayable. I guess the only real reason to buy this on steam is either for mods or if you don't have a console.",0
Negative,"If you don't have an amazing PC and internet connect, trust me, don't even bother playing online. The lag and frame rate loss can be unbelievably awful even in the single player if you only meet the minimum system requirements. sometimes you and enemies will trade blows from 20 feet away which is always hilarious. Combat on the whole is much more twichy and frantic than DS1, hit boxes are still as awful as they've always been though. So between the awful hitboxes and awful lag it's anyones guess whether that attack that looked like it missed will actually.If you own a super computer, knock yourself out, if you don't, not worth even trying",0
Negative,"45 hours played and most the way through the Tombs of Carthus on my play through, some hacker invades and wipes my Save into New Game+ and now all my progress is lost.Looking on various Reddit posts this is something that can happen and folks recommend a 3rd party mod, FROMSOFT you need to patch your game.https://www.reddit.com/r/darksouls3/comments/n1235k/potential_pc_security_exploit_spreading/Other than my Save history being deleted, I love this game.

Negative,"Pros:-Clean looking, a step forward from previous games-Movement, controls and fighting hold great accuracy-A few bosses hold great difficulty-""off da railz"" feeling compared to previous DS games-Artwork is VERY impressive.Cons:-Developer neglect on many, many issues; primarily nondescript operations.-Lack of ""built-in"" lore-Immersion was lacking for me. NPCs and enemies felt empty and unmemorable (outside of a few bosses)-Stats system not fully functional-You might as well run around naked; armor system is lacking-""Co-op"" system shoddy at best-Factions unmemorable and lacking in impact. Invaders get a huge advantage 90% of the time.-Reused areas that offered no real value to the lore-In my opinion, this was the weakest DS game even compared to demon souls. Difficulty was not on par with expectations on the non pvp side. -Hackers are rampant and bypass any detection, ruining gameplay. Non-hackers get bans, thinning the pool increasing chances of getting invaded by a hacker. Conclusion: The game felt like a series of mini games to me. In prior games, areas were truly defining, immersive and memorable. Most bosses felt like empty player checks. The game does provide a certain level of difficulty, but not at the same level as prior games. I would only recommend this game to someone who has not played the previous games or just can't stay away from the DS series.",0
Negative,"Have never played this game and bought it to play with my partner. Turns out the servers are down, no LAN play or anything so it will just be sitting in my library.

Negative,"Screw fan boys, a ""Hard Game"" does not equal a good game. If you make content you release to the masses is based on the premise, that the customer must have participated in the past content, you have failed. This fact is true with every medium. Comic books, Movies and Video Games. Never played Dark Souls one or two, thus making a steep learning curve right off the bat. This game would be fantastic if I was a die hard fan boy who enjoyed their past games. But unfortunately I am a new player, no rose color glasses, no ambition to complete a came that could care less about communicating. If you are a fan, this is your game. if you are new to the series, best to stay away and spend the money on something else.",0
Negative,"im not having fun.i never was.im dissapointed with this game. darksouls1 and 2 were fun but 3? no. i never feel like ive progressed, the map flow is terrable, you cant upgrade armor so you are spongey no matter what, the combat feels jagged and forced, getting souls to level up is always a hassle because nothing wants to drop over 1000 and its never worth the effort, the controls are unresponsive more often than any other souls game and sometimes just go off on their own doing things without your imput the new focus points system needs some major tweaking, the pvp is worse than ever now EVERY hit is a delayed hit, the effects of your stats are garbage especally scaling so you never do enough damage to reliably take down foes in your leveled area, ive encountered NO memorable characters or bosses unique to this game, they tore the story to pieced, and no matter how har i try i just cant get into the game. i said if darksouls3 had these problems i would be done with fromsoft and here we are so im done. darksouls4,bloodborn2,deamon's souls2 i dont care what they call it im not buying it. unless they make some major changes with the coming patches and dlc.",0

Its crazy how toxic they are, I asked for help on a boss, and they recommended me parrying, I've never used a shield and I said I can't do that, after trying to do so, then they made me feel like a clown because I'm not listening to their advice, while their advice does nothing.",0

Negative,"Very negative review. The game is currently unplayable online.I was hoping that the latest update would save Dark Souls 3 on PC, unfortunately this is not the case because I only play with lagging players, Why? PvP is no fun because my opponents now all have 500+ms lag relative to me, it is impossible to win against an opponent who has mastered the ""ultra instinct"". My punch has no right to touch the opponent when he is dealing damage from the other end of the map, after all it is no different from cheating. And there is no crappy internet because I relative to a summoned friend have a ping of 50+ms. Can't you add a system to the game that doesn't allow you to play with people who have a ping greater than 200ms? Blocking individual players completely doesn't work because I have the impression that I would have to block all players from other continents and that's not an option.Bardzo negatywna ocena.

Negative,"If you like Dark souls then this is still better than Dark souls 2 (especially for PC/without a controller). The UI isn't bad either. It's also very beautiful.So, the reason I don't recommend this is that it's a complete mess as it is.People are getting soft banned for absolutely nothing or things they can't even help (like getting invaded by a hacker). There is no poise implemented even though there should be (if you are familiar, you know, if not, it's like a stagger resistance), enemies on the other hand have plenty of poise.Speaking of the devils; The biggest problem is that all enemies have unlimited stamina/Focus points (mana), so they can bomb you with special attacks and spells all day long. Add to this that the game is more blood bourne-like in that enemies hit VERY hard and the forementioned poise bug. In other words enemies can ""turtle"" behind their great tower shields all day (unlimited stamina/hyper stamina regen).Dark souls is known for being extremly hard but a dedicated player-base usually call it ""fair"". This does not hold true for this game. The Dark souls series (like many games) has always suffered from ""artifical difficulty"" but never has it been so prominent as in this. They have quite literally given every gameplay advantage to NPCs and stripped players of the few scraps that made the game playable. In all a very beautiful game BUT when gameplay is your biggest selling point in a game you can't afford to fail as hard as Fromsoft has. If they fix the MANY issues with the game it could be a decent note to end the series with. If not; It's a sad and sloppy way to say goodbye to a very dedicated fan-base.",0
Negative,"I don't want to play it anymore.I just can't.Not only because it's perfomance is just ass, but also because.It's a dissapointment shit.I'm a huge Souls nut and i've waited for this sequel.I love DS2 so much, hell, it's my favourite in Dark series (And probably Souls series, but not SoulsBorne because i haven't played BB).And what did i get in DS3?A huge step back and a huge mark of Miyazaki.This game is just complete reusing of everything that was before WITHOUT improvements and new good stuff from DS2 and WITH a lot of retkons and stupid shit.But most of all, it just not fun to play anymore.Especially considering bosses.Almost none of them bring any challenge at all, and they're just so boring in themself.Weapon arts is an interesting idea that was implemented like shit as an afterthought.All new rings are G A R B A G E that doesn't work. Hell, even old rings stopped working properly. (RIP Flynn)And what can i say about good 'ol From patches that ruin e v e r y t h i n g?*sigh*I hate this game.I hate Miyazaki for being a dick.And i'm just dissapointed.Hell, Salt and Sanctuary, being a shameless ripoff of fist DS, was much better than this game.It's just sad.To hell with you, Dark Souls.Let's just hope that Nioh will be a new frontier.p.s.Though, i must admit, Dark Souls 3 is probably the prettiest and the most beautiful and best visual design wise game in the series, right after Demon's (again, i haven't played Bloodborne)p.p.sI haven't said anything about pvp because EVERYBODY KNOWS ABOUT THAT ALREADY, i don't have to repeat that again.",0
Negative,This game does not have my Consent!,0
Negative,this shit is overrated trash,0
Negative,Good game overall. Not my first Souls game but first one played on the PC.My biggest issues have to be that the game is pretty tough to play with a mouse and keyboard. Pretty much required to have a controller to play.The other is how the whole hacking/banning stuff is being handled. I've read more than enough stories to make me worried. Essentially it comes down to even if you aren't the one hacking but pick up a weapon from a hacker or get hit with a weapon from them (which gives you souls) you will be the one banned. That makes complete sense.If you are playing offline obviously that wont be an issue but that's no fun.,0
Negative,This game is garbage,0
Negative,i am bad at this game so it sucks.,0
Negative,lost all my characters bruh fml,0
Negative,Armor management is awful in comparison to previous games.,0
Negative,"Bloodborne engine with armors and fanservice is Dark Souls 3. The PvE is very good, and I recommend you to buy it if you enjoy the series and want to play alone or with friends, but it's not my favorite part of the series. The PvP is the worst of the DS series and full of glitch abusers, makes me miss DS1 lagstabs. With this game I was a refugee from DS1 and 2 PvP, looking for enjoyment that i'll never get again.",0
Negative,"I am a huge fan of the series and they are truly epic games. With The Ringed City DLC right around the corner, From Software claiming it to be the last addition to the souls series, I thought I'd let curious people know what they're getting into. Everyone else can review how awesome souls games are, Im just going to talk about performance. DS3 does not perform well. Go on over to the Technical Support page and you will see over 5000 unanswered comments in regards to performance issues and other problems. Dating from release to today (March 25th). In response, the Developer posted the minimum and recommended system specs. You can submit additional information to the customer support team. However that was posted nearly a year ago now at launch and the performance issues have not been improved on.Additionally, the patch for the upcoming dlc has created a random bug that will generate a text pop up and boot you to the main menu. My specs are i5-4590 3.30GHz 8GB RAM GTX 970 Windows 10 64 bit. I cannot run this at 1080p/60fps ANYWHERE in game. If you have similar specs, expect to play between 40-60fps in the more optimized areas. Inb4 the nay-sayers, Believe me, I have tried it all to improve my experience.I hope this helps you make an informed decision on whether or not this game will run to your expectations. I love it, but I cannot recommend it based on the performance. Thanks for reading.",0
Negative,bought for multiplayer. multiplayer down,0
Negative,Great game but be wary of purchase until the devs fix the RCE exploit currently in all the dark souls titles.,0
Negative,Tips and menus for controller buttons? Really? Non-pc friendly.,0
Negative,"After playing most every souls game, I have come to a conclusion.This is the worst one.There is next to no challenege in this game. it holds your hand throughout the entire game, and gives you easy and uncreative bosses. They have, and i hate to say it, dumbed down the game for more casual players. Even DaSII is better due to its amazing NG+ experaince, with different weapons and spells to get, and RED PHANTOMS. DaS is by far still the best game in the series due to its unapologetic difficulty and not giving you a free fucking boss victory (minus ceaseless, and Im looking at you Yhorm). All in all, dont buy this game unless you are a souls fanatic like I am, then realize the older games are so much betterBuy DaS I instead its so much better",0
Negative,"Sadly, this game is bad; do not listen to the soul fanatics. All Souls games, Dark Souls 1-2-3, Demon Souls, and Elden Ring, have something that is called delayed dodge. Your character reacts 0.25 seconds after you press the dodge button, even if you press it quickly.This will destroy all your reactions in other games. You think you are improving in other games when you play Souls games, but you aren't. Souls games give you stupid reactions, like having to roll into a monster instead of rolling from it.The game has invincibility frames, which do not exist in other action games, so you will only be good at this kind of games, and if you do not become crazy on the clunky bad control like me, then go ahead.People who say git gud defend a terrible control. No action games except Souls games have this delay, and that is because the devs have done this on purpose to make the game harder. In reality, you trick yourself into believing you will be better at games playing this crap. Every time I play Dragon's Dogma and returned to these crappy genres called Souls games, I have to learn EVERYTHING again. Just skip these bad games and focus on games where the controller works.I can not recommend this, the world is fantastic, but the controller will just make you angry.",0
Negative,"Dark souls 3 is the worst game in the series and it saddens me. I got into soulsborne games through Elden Ring and decided to play the games in order. Dark souls 1 had an amazing soundtrack and interesting world and map and made me actually speak to the npcs simply because I wanted to know more.Dark souls 2 different but good with things such as, Best dlc, best boss in the series (Ivory king), powerstancing, pvp and Aldia was very interesting.Then I get to Dark Souls 3 the game I always see and hear about. Unspoiled I went in expecting the best game in the series. In the start I believed in that. Ludex was great. And vordt made me feel like I'm playing Dark Souls 1 again with how amazing his OST was. But then it came.Curse-rotted tree terrible boss that shows way to little on how it works I think anyone that doesn't look it up will think you must hit the egg cluster in the middle and just die forever to the horrendous hand, Abyss watchers gimmick boss that kills itself, Crystal sage a trash boss that spawns 2000 projectiles at the same time, Deacons of the deep dissapointing boss that is just there and sucks if you are a early caster/Piercing weapon, The skeleton guy who died so fast I don't even remember his name you either killed him instantly or he instantly killed you, Demon king lazy reskin of DS1 taurus demon with the move set of Fire sage.At this point I was terrified.I was thinking to myself it must get better from here. I finally reach the door of Yhorm the cool boss in all the promotional material and I was thinking to myself he must be great. Realise he needs a specific weapon to be killed and all hope is lost. It's a gimmick boss that dies in 5 hits and you can even roll while attack.My soul was crushed 90 dollars robbed from me for the biggest piece of shit I've ever played. The amount of reskined and reused assets is insane. Andre, Demon king, Ornstein (For the third time) and apperently an insane amount of assets and voices and animations we're also reused but that's smaller stuff.Somehow I got myself to keep playing and finally pontiff a good boss I was so happy and then the second phase happened it's the laziest shit I've seen mediocre I thought but better then bad. So I push on and great Gwyndolin who spams 200000 spells at you. They really had to take the worst boss from DS1. I just run at him until he dies. Kill him and get teleported back to Lothric and instantly accidently kill Emma because somehow this game has the worst M+K support in the series with you constantly randomly swinging while using menus. And I don't even care after I fight Dancer. Hands down the best boss so far. Finally feel some enjoyment in the game and feel more sad killing him then happy. I push on run into Cyrus or what ever his name was with the worst hitbox in all of fromsoftware history I don't know how anyone thought you would be able to dodge that rush attack so I give up and find the other bosses. And once again I was happy with Ornstein 3 until second phase came and it's a wait simulator where you wait for the butterfly's to attack so you can finally go in and fight him again unless you wanna risk dying instantly to one of their attacks making it into a wait simulator.This is only the bosses.This game has the worst map easily. Why is it a straight line? And why is the line so thick? All the other games were claustrophobic corners until now and then you play this game with so many pointless wide spaces. And the biggest offender is the worst DLC I've played in my life Painting of arms or whatever. God, the most pointless open world bullshit I've seen. So much running in the middle of no where when all the bosses sit in the back. Not to mention to get to the first important boss you have to run across the entire map. Go through a invisible wall and into an arena that just looks like a shit pile to pull a lever. And what do you get the worst boss I've fought in my life. A boss with 3 health bars, A gimmick and a gank and I must ask how? How did we get these duo bosses from the greatness of Ornstein and Smough.This game suffers from every boss being a gimmick that makes it insanely easy or insanely annoying. I don't think I ever died to a boss if it wasn't a gimmick. For example the gay ass Nukes from the butterfly's in the Third Ornstein fight. I was constantly running away from him so I can just check if they are charging anything so I don't just take 90% damage from the projectiles.Aside from all my complaining if you are able to get through this pile of negatives it still has it's share of good.Best tutorial boss (Ludex), The most spectacle in any of the games, Some great bosses such as Nameless king, Vordt, Boreal Dancer and Champion Gundyr, some of the most fun weapons in the series ex Farron Greatsword and better looking bosses then DS2.It's sad to see a game with so much potential wasted.I can't say it's worth the money it's easily the shortest game in the series while costing 2x more. And the older games give the dlc for free. And you will also be able to play half of this game but better since half the assets are just taken from the old games. Buying Ds1 + Ds2 gives 4 dlc's for free which are vastly better for the same price as DS3 + the dlc.",0

Piss poor camera angles, even though you control it with the mouse, it would spiral when in battle or in a tight location.Why there are so many likes when this is a piss poor port I can't fathom.

Negative,"Dark Souls III is a mixed bag at the moment. On a design level, the game is great. On a technical level however. it's pretty bad. That shouldn't be surprising given that this is a FromSoftware game, but they've outdone themselves this time in a number of ways. Performance isn't great on a lot of rigs, especially lower-end ones. Stuttering and frame drops are quite common, though there have been a few optimizations since launch (or so it seems). Script kiddies are still a thing, of course, but they aren't as common as recent coverage of this issue may imply. The bigger issue on the multiplayer side of things is the current softban system. Script kiddies have acquired hacks which can alter your save files and give your character souls or change them in various ways. This triggers the automatic softban system, which has banned many innocent players already, and will likely ban more before the issue is resolved though the system seems to do very litte against players who are actually using cheats/hacks. FromSoft have at least been looking into the issue, although so far the only hotfix introduced even more stuttering into the game, and has since been reverted for that reason. Auto-summon covenants, such as the Blades of the Darkmoon, Farron Watchdogs, etc, have been all but broken since the launch of the game. The issue seems to be linked to account age, of all things. It seems that using a family share account resolves the issue, indicating that newer accounts are much more likely to see action than older ones. There is still no official fix for the issue however. And now, there appears to be a new bug to top it all off. Players have, over the past week or so, been finding themselves unable to play online, without any connection issues or ban notifications. The issue reportedly affects all platforms, and renders players unable to participate in multiplayer. So far this seems to affect multiplayer with random players, as well as passworded summoning sessions with friends. If you have a decent rig, and only plan on playing single-player, then it may still be worth picking up, despite all of these issues. If you're mainly interested in multiplayer or co-op with a friend, then now is not a good time to buy in. It's tough to recommend this game while it has so many glaring issues.",0
Negative,"Banned for using ""Souls Unsqueezed"" to allow to run in windowed mode. Absolutely amazing that in 2018 a game can't run in borderless windowed without additional steps.Bandai Namco are very ban heavy, using archaic anti-cheat tech with no real way of appealing it.",0

Negative,"An offline mod called ""Cinders Mod"" was recommended by the prominent youtuber FightinCowboy. It's a mod that rebalances the game and enables different ways to play the game. After a long break, I turned on Dark Souls 3, forgetting that I hadn't uninstalled Cinders mod. When I saw that it was still present, I promptly deleted the character. FromSoftware however notified me that ""Invalid data remains on my account and I have been penalized, restricting online play."" Their ""penalizations"" are in fact a permanent ban. I contacted customer support and they told me that once all invalid data was removed it would be reviewed and the penalization would be lifted. This is not the case however. I deleted all characters, uninstalled and reinstalled the game, and still the penalty remains 4 months later. I cannot recommend FromSoftware games due to the way they treat their fans.

Negative,"First off. I find the PvP aspect of this game to be immensely disappointing. The matching of player lvls is clumsy as in it's non existent. You will be ganked over and over and over and over and over and over when the kids are let out of school.The game is pretty good, I enjoy the game play a lot, the graphics are amazing and the story is great. I think the multiplayer tag should be removed, I feel it's misleading, I probably would have avoided the game had I known about the mass world arena PvP fest with no level matching. I wanted a multiplayer not this. still, once the children go to bed, it's a fairly ok game! Pros: Great graphics, amazing story, the combat is great once you get used to it!Cons: The other players.",0
Negative,"As much as i liked the original dark souls on the xbox 360, and as much as i like the dark souls franchise in general, i cannot recommend any of them on PC, as the devs and publisher seem to not care about the very rampant hacker issue that plagues these games, the most heinous of which is the fact that hackers can now forcefully inject items into your inventory at any point when you're summoned or invaded, and not only ruin your save, but almost assures that you are banned from online play as well, on top of the fact that you can only appeal a ban once, if you get banned again, you're done, no more online for you. I bought this game specifically to interact with the community and play online. I've had the game for 5 days now, and was already banned, and i got this on sale. for the love of all that is holy do NOT buy this game at full price, it is just simply not worth the money if the developers cannot implement a reasonable anticheat that doesn't actively work against legit users. I wish i could refund this game but sadly it took 7 hours just to realize the first time that this was a giant issue.",0

Negative,"I read ""Full controller support"" up there, but that's just a lie. It won't work with DS4 no matter what driver you use. As of now the game is not playable so I can't recommend it.",0
Negative,"Would I recommend the game for new players? Yes. It's a good starting point if you want to play the series backwards.Would I recommend it to hardcore, Demons' Souls/Dark Souls players? No. It was tuned down so much. and some solutions.I've finished the game in far under 20 hours while exploring nearly every corner of it, failing some quests but not caring much. Exploring entire maps. And there's just so much wrong with what it became. DS 1 felt like a very, very giant, open world filled with intersections between maps. DS 3 doesn't give that feeling anymore, to a point it hurts me actually. You are given a feeling that you've got a choice, I mean if you're good you can kill Dancer instantly and go to castle at once right? Except you will get murdelized by high-end monsters. But in end, any side-areas you enter, you enter once and leave them for good unless a quest orders you otherwise. Smouldering Caves? Went there once, gotten everything I needed, never returned again. This was never a case of DS1, I kept travelling past all the maps.Difficulty? Far, far below expected. Out of 18 bosses (if I count it right) I've had issues with only 4 using my PVP focused build. Ever tried beating Seath or Four Kings using a bleed/backstab dex dagger build in DS 1? No? Try it, tell me how it went. It is a challenge. And don't get me started on Orstein. but here? I understand I used greatsword+shield, but still no boss took me more than 3 tries solo (except the ones mentioned) and I think at least 8 died at first try. Where's difficulty in that? Especially that you can summon an army of sun-praising fantoms nowadays.Then there's the fact that a lot of mechanics that allowed for build customization around armors and poise were overhauled to a point in which you are nearly forced to resign from playing certain builds. (Staggerlocking Havel armor with a mediocre-enchanted Katana pays its respects.)There's a lot I could go into detail which I didn't like and which I did, but it would take a long time.Pro:- Locations design (graphical)- Music- Immersion- You are dead- Weaps/spells variety- CovenantsCons:- Low difficulty- Locations design (technical aspect)- Invade PVP design- Poise- Simple enemies- Bonfires next to each other.?- LORE! - with capital letters and exclamation point intended.I guess I'll keep playing since it has people online, but the game was turned into low learning curve production for masses, where many cry when they die. Here's an update for you: It's Dark Souls. The game which originally got famous for it's insane difficulty level and real challenges it presented. This part is much easier than the originals, so get over yourselves and play the game which was originally ALL about dying and nobody complained <3Good luck and stay away from Ferrus woods if you don't want to meet up~",0

They seem to have just given up on this game in my opinion in terms of PvP, it is very unbalanced and just overall trash.

Felt like the game was telling me I needed an XBOX controller to play.Got so frustrated with controls I never want to play this game again.",0
Negative,"My background: I completed DS1 and DS2 twice each, never played BB (don t own a PS). I nearly completed DS3 in 2018, got stuck on Midir before linking the fire (i.e., before finalizing the NG). Recently, I ve gone for a second playthrough and quitted right after beating the Nameless King.For me, DS3 was a disappointing and frustrating experience overall. Here s the list of my gripes:- Poise is turned off for the player. Even the most basic hollow soldier can stunlock you to death.- Shields are useless, because rolling is much cheaper (in terms of stamina) and gives you an opportunity to reposition on top of that.- Armor is useless.- Longswords/katanas are infinitely better in PvE than any other weapon types. You just don t want to switch to a GS/UGS after getting used to fast, decently damaging swings of a one-handed sword.- Non-gimmick bosses are fast paced, they have unlimited stamina, erratic attack patterns, and often multiple health bars. This is not bad per se. However, combined with the problems listed above, it gives you a typical DS3 boss fight: stick to the enemy, roll 10 times, poke 1 time, roll 10 times, poke 1 time, rinse and repeat. If a mistake happens, you re likely boned (with like 70-80% Estus left). Attacks and moves of a boss can be memorized after 2 or 3 tries. Then you learn nothing, you just pray to RNGesus that patterns will be more forgiving next time. This is everything but fun for me. I guess, this is what happens when BB concepts are inserted inconsistently into a DS environment. I miss slow-paced, thoughtful and strategic boss battles of DS1 and DS2, where you considered positioning, used arena layout, chose between rolls and shield blocks, altered your loadout, etc.- The world design is super-linear. In DS1, there was a beautifully intertwined world with alternative paths. In DS2, there were many (although, linear and dead-end) paths starting from Majula.- Tons of re-used location concepts from DS1: a ruined castle wall, some boney catacombs, an annoying swamp, a big library, a painted snowy world, some fiery underworld, an Anor Londo style palace/city. It s an uninspired safe play from the developers.I can t recommend this game given that DS1 and DS2 exist. I don t approve of the direction Souls games are going.",0
Negative,"The game would be very enjoyable if not for these ""minor"" inconveniences /s:- Constant game freezes or crashes (the game and Nvidia drivers apparently don't work well together unless you downgrade to 6 months old drivers - I have a gtx 1070 and the only way to prevent this is to play in windowed mode) REALLY!?- If you want to experience the joys of co-op online play, be warned that half the time you get summoned to help another player, you won't be able to pass the fog gate to the boss room- The game is full of bugs, glitches and other exploits which FROM Software is unable to fix since the game's release. I'm not talking about using the Cheat Engine in offline mode, I'm talking about things that have been around all the time in online play like tumblebuffing, item/soul duping, using the cheat engine to get unfair advantages over other online players (yes, the occasional soft ban is NOT an efficient method to remove blatant cheating), etc- PvP in this game is FLAWED. There are ONLY 2 regions to play from - Japan and the rest of the world. Now imagine playing in the arena versus someone who is 12000 km away from you (Europe - Latin America), as is happening to me usually several times a day. Playing with a 250+ ping difference is NOT an enjoyable user experience. - FROM Software/BAMCO has one of the WORST customer services I have ever encountered in an online game. They won't give a damn about your problems. There's even a good possibility you will get soft banned if you never used cheats/exploits. If you're experiencing frequent crashes, it might corrupt your game files, which in turn seems like they were edited and will result in a ban. Fix your damn game, FROM Software!For reasons stated above, I do not recommend buying this faulty product unless these issues are fixed in a timely manner, which is highly unlikely.",0
Negative,"Spoilers below. I'm definitely not hardcore, but I've probably put in 500-1000 hours across all 3 games over the years. DS3 is the most disappointing of the trilogy. For the most part, it's just ""more souls content"". Do not buy this game at full price.I'm not sure where to start. maybe with the fact that literally over half of the bosses are humanoid melee fights? I'm being generous here and not counting a few like NK. My point is that it really feels like they didn't even try to come up with the memorable and creative bosses that they made in previous games. Don't get me wrong; the bosses in DS3 are challenging and you'll die a lot before you get the hang of it (this is definitely a Dark Souls game), however, the challenge is mostly ""let's give the boss a phase 2 where they attack really fast or you have to dodge some dark projectile"". It's boring. This is in contrast to say DS1, where you not only had bosses of all kinds with different mechanics (a few sucked, of course), but a lot of the bosses had strong emotional appeal due to the rich lore, like Sif and Artorias. Granted, there are a few exceptions here, mostly Gael and NK. I found DS2 was worse than DS1 as well, but they had a much richer diversity of bosses than DS3. DS2 had a much higher proportion of generic bosses, but, in fairness, they eclipse 1 and 3 in total boss count, with a number of quasi-mini-filler bosses.And, I think that the bosses are representative of the conclusion; they didn't even try to be creative or innovative at all with this game. They churned this game out much quicker than the other 2, as they wanted to grab some money and wrap up the series.Another example: the world-space. Firstly, a lot of it is ripped from the first game (either directly, like Anor Londo, Demon Ruins, or as a reminiscent copy, like High Wall + Settlement <-> Undead Bergs, Road + Farron <-> Darkroot Gardens + Royal Wood, Smouldering Lake <-> Ash Lake, and more). And look, maybe some of it is fine, as the point of DS3 is to wrap up the series, and the overall theme (including the DLC) sort of mocks the futility of the age of Fire, so they needed some contrast to show the decay. Granting that, they copied locations from DS2 as well, and the connectedness and sheer magic of DS1 is gone. I felt like clapping upon seeing the Demon Ruins as I got near Nito in DS1. The whole thing was so innovative. DS3 had a nice vista of Anor Londo, and a nice view from the top of Lothric castle, but the locations are still small, very linear in progression, and derivative. DS2 did not have the same magic as DS1 for me and the world-space was not well-connected, but they made a serious attempt to make interesting and original locations. A lot of the locations in DS2 are still memorable.And, I think that's a great differentiator here. DS2, even though it failed in some ways, really tried to branch off the original and build on the original game. DS3 just said ""screw it, let's rip from 1"".which segues me into the story. It's the same as DS1 and DS2. You kill 4 bosses which unlocks the bad guy. But, whereas DS2 echoed DS1 while having its own fully fleshed and unique story (albeit, it wasn't as interesting as DS1), DS3 opts to either directly copy DS1 in most aspects while just having less lore overall. The 4 bosses in DS3 play a pivotal role in the story as they do in DS1 (not emphasized as much in DS2), however, they're horribly motivated. Abyss Watchers are a rip of 4 Kings/Artorias with no interesting story. Yhorm/Profaned Capital is mostly an afterthought. Lothric is a little better but not much. Aldritch might be the exception. But it doesn't hold a candle to DS1: in particular, the Witch of Izalith (say what you will about Lost Izalith and Bed of Chaos, the story was very compelling), Nito, and Seath leading up to Gwyn were quite rich in lore. Meanwhile, comparing to Gwyn, the final boss of DS3 has 0 lore (rather, it's a vague philosophical idea with copied boss mechanics), and then we just link the flame again (or don't, again). What a massive letdown.The one DS3 did right in this regard was The Ringed City. We should forget that the Soul of Cinder + Flame Ending never happened. This was a perfect ending. They really did a good job here. The falsely preserved city, the pygmies locked away by Gwyn, hiding the dried out, fragmented blood of the Dark soul, and two humans/undead killing each other to paint a new preserved world, ironically destroying what's been preserved in the process, when only dust remains at the end of fire. Really raises a lot of interesting philosophical thoughts and insights in the same way that the first game did. And, if we pretend Gael was the final boss, he was top notch.Despite that, that's mostly the only positive. There are only a few other things to mention. The only cool weapons and armor in the game are ripped from prior games. The mechanics are *mostly* the same. The only real noticeable change in gameplay to me was decreasing the ratio of area to bonfire, which definitely casualized the game significantly and I have mixed opinions on.In conclusion, I'd say of course it's worth a (few) playthrough(s) if you're a Souls fan, but I'd say it's definitely NOT worth the price they're charging ($60-85). It wasn't even worth that at release. DS3 felt like a money grab, rather than a labor of love like DS1 (and mostly DS2) did.",0

Negative,"The game is amazing and looks good.but it suffers from major porting problems and malfunctions.My freshly installed and updated copy of Windows 7 has suffered more than 30 blue screens of death by now, and judging by what the reddit forums say, I'm not the only one.Despite the advertising about how ""60 FPS"" would be stable on PC, many areas are indeed NOT stable and will drop. Even using the right monitor with the right settings does not prevent flickering sometimes, online play is laggy and filled to the brim with bugs, the most ""funny"" being other players not being able to perform any animation on your screen while they clearly are and are also able to see that on their screen.My suggestion is simple: if you really have to buy this game on PC, wait for a patch. If you own a console, ditch the PC release and buy a console copy which will run at 30 fps, sure, but won't freeze your system or cause major flickering.Also, these being the first days after release, the game is heavily unbalanced towards the player, and demands having a higher level than you have to progress, even if you farmed for hours.Scarce resources and absence of a bonefire ascetic item make leveling weapons a pain, since past the +3 mark it will be nearly impossible to upgrade a secondary or tertiary weapon.Long story short: do you mind playing a game that could hurt your PC, is yet unbalanced and has poor online support and no cloud sync? If the answer is no go ahead and try your luck, if the answer is yes you should try a console retail copy or just wait a month or two for From to actually do their job.",0

Even lore references are a bitch slap.In conclusion, don\'t be deluded like those who pray every Miyazaki move.

Negative,"""Ironically Hollow"" is how I'd describe the last addition to the Dark Souls series.Sure you do the same old thing, gotta link that fire.and that's it. In the last games it had truly memorable and landscape where the Lore was easy to tease out without excessive digging to at the very least have a general feel.In this final incarnation there are very forgettable characters and unfortunately no lore to speak of.Where would Hollow apply then?In short, the Games combat mechanics are solid and functional. Not quite the same as the last games but it works.But that's just it. There's only the gameplay, there's only the combat. There is no true gratification for completion of a Goal in this game, only relief it's done.There's no lore, items or real NPC's to call it's own, just borrowed assets and a disgusting excess of fanservice for the first game.I feel nothing for my character or his intereactions. There's only 2 NPC's in the entire game I give a half-shit about and only one of them is original to this game alone instead of a fanservice Clone.PvE (Player versus environment) works fine and is simply enough. A few enemies and placements feel utterly unfair and/or cheap with either excessive numbers or limitless attacks. But overall it is manageable with a little practice and memorization to the point of triviality. However, PvP (Player versus Player) has always been one of the bigger selling points of these games and here is one of the biggest shortcomming of this Game. If you invade the game has slanted victory to the side of the Host as it should be, but they went much too far. The invader will have a 30% reduction of thier max hp when entering someones world (this i'm fine with), yet the more Phantoms a Host has the more priority they have to be invaded. If you're alone you can go hours without seeing a single invader unless you find a red sign(willing invasion) and call them in. Even then only one Invader can enter a Hosts world when they can have upward of 4 friendlies without opening up the chance for a second hostile phantom.This is without mentioning an item that turns all enemies on the map hostile towards the invader. Or the fact the invader must retrieve thier Souls from the location they died in the other world. PvP just feels so empty and frustrating. 80% of the time you'll be fighting a 3v1 Battle which stunts one of the most important aspects of the Dark souls series, replayability. Even in PvE there is virtually no replayability, you can beat the game hundreds of times. With each defeat of the final boss you can enter a NG+ where the enmies gain slightly more health and damage. But that's it.you can find rings that are improved versions of lesser ones, but that only stretches to NG+2 before hitting a cap when the upgraded Rings themselves offer little benefit over the base ones.Once you've played through the game once, that's it, there's nothing else left to see.Even when the DLC drops I have no intention of returning unless it is absolutely phenominal. I regret buying the Season Pass.I understand Miyazaki (The founder and crator of the Souls series) wanted it to end here, but it shouldn't feel that way.I've followed the series since Demons Souls was brought to North America by Atlas. I've loved the series as a whole and played thousands of hours in it. Yet just as the first flame is dying, this game lacks a spark. It's just a husk, and I feel nothing but disappointment in how it is ending.With that said, I can't recommend this game. Yes, I played hundreds of hours in it, but that should only make my point stronger. Very little of all that time was I genuinely enjoying myself instead of struggling to find something to like in a series that has been a part of my life for almost a decade.Much like the Warrior of Firelink Shrine and his DS3 clone. I'm simply.Crestfallen.",0

Negative,"An amazing feat in game design, there is nothing else like Dark Souls right now. A modern game that's actually about overcomming challenges the developers have laid out, instead of just interactive movies.There are a few rough edges, some of the covenants probably don't work as intended and generally the PvP matchmaking is a bit wonky. Also long standing fans of the franchise will not find almost anything new in DS3 which is surprisingly disappointing in a Hidetaka Miyazaki title. But apart from that the game is worth every penny.EDIT: Changing my review, alas. Looking back the game doesn't stand the test of time. Compared to previous Miyazaki titles it feels lazy, phoned in and overly by-the-numbers. It'll probably be a blast on the first playthrough (that's why my initial positive review) but it has very low replayability, due to the incredibly phoned in NG+. The addons show a bit more care and interest on the part of the devs, especially the last one.

Dark souls 1 told you a story of a undead sent in a journey to rekindle the flame, and Dark souls 2 which was to easy grasped me with a story .

Negative,"The bosses are probably the best (as a whole) in the whole From lineup - but the areas are incredibly lackluster. Not to mention, there is no multiplayer currently (ongoing for 2 months now) and no updates from the dev team. The achievements are probably the most tedious in all of the games. Getting covenant items takes just hours and hours of killing the same 2-3 enemies over and over again. Repeat that 4 times.",0

Negative,"There is an option unlike the previous souls games in the series to not progress to new game after completing the final boss. I was on the second DLC and wanted to complete it so I chose the option to NG later. You can do so at the Firelink Shrine bonfire at any time. I was invading people for fun and on about the fourth one after just having completed the final boss the game randomly rolled the opening cinematic and went to NG. I was upset, but not wholly enraged. I still needed my sage ring + 2 among other ring upgrades from the next playthroughs. So, upon reaching Firelink Shrine and placing Gundyrs coiled sword into place I reached a hard locked game breaking glitch that, though rare, traps your current character and you must start over anew. I researched a decent bit seeing if anyone else experienced the glitch where you cannot travel to High Wall of Lothric and were trapped at the shrine. It turned out that many different threads had been posted in different intervals throughout the years with the same broken glitch. Honestly, DS2 is GOATED. Did nobody play test a hard lock at the start of the game? It can occur first playthrough or the 5th. The game is trash. If you want to go waste 70 hours and have materials and fully upgraded items for a build only to have to start fresh because you beat the game, then you go right ahead. Myself, however, am finding it hard to find the drive to start over with the possibility of never seeing NG or NG+ and having to coin toss 10's of hours of my life to the RNG of buggy programming. Don't waste your time.",0
Negative,"IF you do not meet the minimum required specs for this game then I'd think twice about buying this on PC. I made it through the first ""journey"" but with a handful of fustrating moments because my machine is a bit outdated (the only outdated part being my GTX 660). The performance issues translated into stuttering in the game, or the game freezing for seconds at the time typically at the entrances and exits of new areas. This complication sometimes makes easy encounters with mobs or other players particularly hard. I was still able to play through the game, but I wish I had a more polished experience and slightly regret the decision of getting this of PC. If you want a consistent experience I'd definitely point you in the direction of a console version of the game if you own one.",0

Negative,"If you want to see other concerns that I may share, see the criticism of others. My true annoyance with the game is the poor new game + system. I don't want to rely on pvp to experience something slightly new. Dark souls 2 was far better in that regard and while this game is designed beautifully, it lacks polish is several areas that become noticeable around the new game + run (atleast they did for me).Thanks for taking the time to read this :)",0
Negative,After 25 hrs into the game a hacker invaded me and i lost all my progress. I even got lucky because the hacker could fuck up my whole pc.

Dont buy the game until they fixed that exploit,0
Negative,"The game itself is fine but there are hackers who can erase your entire game progress simply through online co-op.

Negative,"Lovely Game but I wouldn't recommend buying nor playing it these days. Not possible to play online nor co-op. You either get invated by a way too overpowered enemy wanting just to own fresh spawns ( f.e. invades with lightning weapons on the high wall, etc. ) , or get invaded by hackers that corrupt your safe file.

Negative,"The first Dark Souls game was a masterpiece. The second is the game I played the most, and I loved it despite the community thinking it was bad. And finally, the third I have mixed feelings with.I played Dark Souls 1 a couple of times and enjoyed it, and still enjoy it every time I boot it up. Dark Souls 2 I played for more than a few times, and spent probably almost a thosand hour playing. But with Dark Souls 3, after beating it twice, every time I boot it up, I exit after couple of minutes. All builds are quite boring. The only really viable ones are luck and quality builds. Using any other builds than these, you might as well pick up a broken straight sword. ""Oh, but magic is fun"", no it isn't. As a magic caster, the only magic that will be usefull to you are buffs, with a few exceptions where you can cheese bosses from a far. And as a magic caster you only get the good spells in the very end of the game, and magic doesn't start to scale well until very high levels either. As for melee builds, It doesn't matter if you go strenght or dexterity anymore. Most weapons have same dexterity as strenght damage scaling, and if they don't you can just infuse it so that it begins to scale with what you want. ""The greatsword is a very large weapon, wieldable only by those with inhuman strenght"", nope. Just infuse it with sharp gem and go dexterity instead. Boring. Bosses. Pretty disappointing to be honest. Not much more to say other than that.",0
Negative,If you havent played the previous games. You should. THEN play this game. you will have the full scope of things and give a proper opinion. If you want a casual experience then toally pick this up. if you want a game that can get you hooked play the first one at least.,0
Negative,"Great game. Amazing game. One of my favorite games. Unfortunately, hackers can instantly take away all your progress for just being online. It looks like no one is going to do anything about it (so far). AND the exploit could open YOUR COMPUTER up to being hacked (info stolen, computer bricked). Only play in offline mode.",0
Negative,"Dark Souls is my fav game series of all time. I played them all and they are all amazing. So theres nothing wrong with the game. The problem is the players. Not only do they use cheats to invade you and kill you. Thats fine. Whats worse they use hacks to permanently destroy your characters. Only thing left to do is delete the character or to also use hacks to get it back. So if you want to play online i recommend you to buy a console and play on it. Losing days worth of progress because some 12 year old has found a cheat engine is not worth it imo. And NO bandai cant and/or wont restore your progress. And they told me in their mail, if I would use a save file to restore my character it would be banned from online play. Gee thanks",0

Negative,"good luck invading and having 10,000 phantoms ram your cornhole at once",0
Negative,"Here is just one single problem with Dark Souls 3. Just one problem, out of many.Here's my essay on blue phantoms.In order to be summoned as a blue phantom, whose role is to defeat invaders in the worlds of embered host players, there are some ridiculous conditions which must be met. First of all, in order to be summoned as a blue phantom, the host must equip the Way of the Blue covenant item and be invaded. Sounds simple doesn't it? How could this possibly be flawed?Let's explain why this, as a concept, just does not work reliably (if at all for the majority of players). Let's look at the Way of the Blue covenant, and how it is absolutely required for any players hoping to be summoned as blue phantoms in to a hosts world and collect covenant items to rank up their covenant level.To obtain the Way of the Blue covenant item you must speak to Emma in the chapel in Lothric, near the first real boss of the game. Talking to Emma for the first time nets you the item used to proceed past the first boss. You then need to speak to her a second time to receive the Way of the Blue covenant item.Just from this we can see that we have an issue here. The covenant is partially missable (the reason why I say partially is because if you miss it at the start of the game, you are more or less guaranteed to obtain it towards the end of it when she dies and you have to speak to her as she is dying to proceed to the next part of the game). This right here creates an issue for all players wanting to be summoned as blue phantoms. It won't be missable to many players, but still a significant number which will ultimately affect the multiplayer portion of the game.I will have to post the rest of this in the comments due to the nonsensical low character limit for Steam reviews.",0
Negative,"Bad Checkpoint Simulator: IIIDie and have to run back to the same area again, and have to pick up your experience/currency again. It just becomes a case of having the willpower to be bothered to hold sprint in a direction for 2-3 mins again. Bought this game to play co-op with a friend. Three games in and co-op is so clunky. You can't progress together- you just progress one person who can then only use the fire shrines if you leave, to get their pots back, travel and level up. If you die they have to summon you again. If they die they have to summon you again. CAN'T OPT OUT OF INVASIONS:During solo play if you have an 'ember' buff, you can get invaded by other players. (you can play offline as solo) Would probably ONLY recommend this game for solo players.If you manage to 4D chess into co-op with your friends, you open yourself up to invasions. You can lock co-op with a password, but invaders can still join regardless. Why is this an issue? You just started the game. The invader is a stupidly high level twink built for PVP. They can't be hit because of the sudden huge latency when they join, and if you do hit them you barely do any damage. They have much more experience in in-game combat mechanics, so you don't really stand a chance. This happens SO often , it makes the learning curve of the game horrible and almost unplayable.Bosses and combat are fun, but bad checkpoints, clunky co-op mechanics and laggy invasions make it really awkward for me. I'll probably complete it then not play it again.Even though I have this many hours, they're spent starting another character, because I want to try a new build, beginning the process of leveling and finding the spells, and giving up, because it's so tedious.This game takes things like Talent trees, game invites via Steam (or other), checkpoints, and throws them away. The game isn't difficult either, you can run 2h STR builds and 3 shot bigger enemies, the only reason it feels difficult, is because the learning curve time is lengthened by having to reach the same area over and over, if you die.Playing as a magic user or DEX user is randomly complete aids when compared to picking the biggest weapon you can find and putting points in STR.Magic users randomly need DEX, which doesn't benefit you in any other way than increasing your spell cast speed. It's never clear by how much, and you also need other stats for HP and carry weight. The aesthetic and combat system carry this game so heavily, but the leveling, co-op, vague/pointless story and awful checkpoint system make it a chore.Enemies have extremely weird hitboxes on attacks, give off no information on whether you can stunlock them with your combos or not, and make weapons where you can roll 100x and do one fast attack at a time best. Anything else is just trial and error, trying to do combos and a poise stat on enemies that you can't see result in you taking damage.They can also attack through walls.",0

Negative,"I recently completed the game minus Midir, which was more about fighting the shitty camera and RNG nature of his moveset than the actual boss. The good of DSIII would be the atmosphere, the set pieces and the music. The firelink shrine theme is possibly one of the better pieces of game music I've heard.The bad is kind of everything else. Too many ""gotcha"" moments like 1HKO boss moves and the majority of chests were mimics. Too many enemies with large sweeping arcs and jump attacks that close distance instantly. It's like they knew Artorias was a good fight so they just copied that mechanic without knowing what made it a good to begin with. Then on top of that they buffed the shit out of boss HP/resistance. Most of the late game fights and DLC bosses were not enjoyable and felt like a slog. Demon Prince/Midir being the worst offenders. On top of ruining what made DS enjoyable, they just copy/pasted so much from the first game it felt like I was playing ""Member Dark Souls?""",0

Game feels dead.Don't buy it.",0
Negative,"TL;DR - If you want the game for the PvE and don't care about online I highly recommend the game. I personally don't have any performance problems except for a few frame drops every now and then. If you want it for online wait until it gets fixed.Dark Souls 3 is a fun game ruined by terrible online. And I'm not talking about lag or anything like that, I'm talking about the complete garbage anticheat that bans people that haven't done anything. The problems with covenants is another story and I personally don't think it's too bad because you can farm the covenant items (although very slowly), but the big one is the anticheat.So in case you aren't aware by now, the way this game detects somebody that cheats is very.unclear. All you get is a message that says ""invalid game data detected"". What does this mean? Who knows. It could be a mod, it could be a program that let's you use your controller of choice, or absolutely nothing at all. Even completely reinstalling your game won't help you after you see this message. You're fucked. Enjoy only being able to play online with other cheaters which, funnily enough, will soon have just as many legit players as those who haven't been flagged!Also, there has been word that the developement team is aware of the issue with the anticheat sucking ass and the cheating problem in general but lets be real here. This is FromSoft. Don't expect a fix any time soon. I wouldn't be surprised if it happens after a whole year and requires you to purchase the game again with very few changes for another 60USD (or your regional equivalent) with a ridiculous name like Dark Souls 3: Remembrance of the Embered King.Even if they do fix this I doubt the people that are banned will be unbanned. That's what happened with Dark Souls 2 and I am willing to assume that it will happen again. This is the FromSoft way. They refuse to be reasoned with. And since I think most people will use the online features at some point I would suggest just avoiding the game unless you plan on not touching online at all. If you do go online just be aware that you run the risk of getting flagged by being invaded by some guy that is cheating that can get your account flagged (yes, the people that actually cheat can get legit players banned), which will lead to an eventual ban. I personally have not been given a warning message or banned but I don't need that know how bullshit this is. Fix your game FromSoft.",0
Negative,"Since everyone keeps praising how good this game is, I will list all the problems this game has and leave out the good things.For anyone who isn't a casual player, this game is not hard by any means. The difficulty often comes from the fact that many of the bosses are so large that you can't see what they are doing half the time. (Iudex Gundyr 2nd phase, Curse-Rotted Greatwood, High Lord Wolnir, Yhorm the Giant) and sometimes boss hitboxes are inconsistent, especially when you are under or behind the boss. I counted about 30 deaths to all 15 or 16 bosses I killed. 2 deaths per boss on average is nothing compared to many other games with boss fights. I went with the default character, class and equipment most of the game. Halfway through I switched my sword and upgraded it, but that was all I did. No summons, and I didn't even need to think about tactics in this game.The camera messes with you, so most of the time I didn't lock on to enemies, and went with the free camera.Not sure who thought it was a great idea for the game to remember what button you pressed 1.5 seconds ago. For example, when pressing dodge at the start of the attack animation, the game still remembers that button press, and then dodges after the animation ends. Controls as a whole do not feel responsive, compared to most other games, even other ""souls-like"" games. Can't even cancel these long animations, which is the #1 reason of getting hit.There is little to no depth to combat and no need for tactics. You can beat every encounter with the same exact way. Dodge and hit. The only thing you need to change is when to dodge and hit. Yes there is parry and block, but parrying is a gimmick, and blocking just makes this game even easier than it already is.This game has a bad PC port. Can't recommend using mouse and keyboard since From Software did not properly implement support for it. I had not used a controller for 8 years, and had to relearn just to play this game. Mouse sensitivity even with the lowest setting is way too high. All info texts are made for controller, so good luck remembering the controls, since you need to go to the menu to look which button does what.Multiplayer for this game is just bad. This is the only game in history where playing with your friends makes the game worse. When playing alone and having ember effect, I get invaded maybe once every 3 hours. When I tried with my friend at the start of the game, we got invaded every 20 mins. This invasion BS combined with the fact that there is a hacker problem in this game. The hackers can delete your save file and get you permabanned, among other things.",0
Negative,"I have played a handful of Souls-likes even though the genre isn't my favorite, and DS3 just isn't up to par even for its time. I respect that some people live for this game, but even if I was really into this genre/style of game I would not recommend it. Remnant: From the Ashes builds upon the formula in a great way and includes a much better co-op experience that I would highly recommend over this one.Moving past the problems that most people have with souls-likes into specifically what is wrong with Dark Souls 3 in comparison to other games in its own genre:Input Buffering: this is really the biggest issue for me, and if this were handled like any other normal action game I could give DS3 a recommendation despite my other qualms. For a game based around precision and timing having such a long input buffer (3+ seconds) makes no sense. It completely takes control of your character away when you are a few milliseconds late on a dodge then after your character is done being staggered he stands to his feet then rolls from the dodge that you tried to do before the attack that downed you. At the end of the game I even was using the Murakumo and fell off an edge because I quickly double tapped LT, which used a heavy attack that took 2-3 seconds, then immediately followed up with the same exact attack even though I had not pressed any buttons in that time. A friend and I tested this for several different weapons and it occurred for many of them, reinforcing that this is a design choice and programmed functionality.Co-Op jank: Frustrating co-op play is standard for the genre, but it doesn't have to be. There is no co-op progress, you must do everything twice if you want to progress concurrently with a friend. Remnant easily does away with this jank, and any co op game as early as Borderlands 1 shows it is easy to do. The way the summon system is implemented paired with my next point is a huge detriment to DS3 that could easily be avoided.Invasions and Embers: Both of these things on their own would be a fine mechanic that furthers the punishing nature of the game, but being unable to turn off invasions and simultaneously losing the ability to play co-op when you are killed in an invasion removes control from players, limiting the already cumbersome feature of co-op play. The very first time I was able to go into co-op, my experienced friend joins on a new character and we take 5 steps and are invaded by a high level opponent invading people in the starting zone. This style of harassment is rewarded by the system, and to have it be uncapped by level letting end game players grief noobs reaches a level of idiocy in design that I have not seen since tripping in super smash.My other issues such as enemies striking through objects even though you cannot, and the decoupling of several stats pale in comparison to my main issues above, and I would never recommend this game to anyone since there are much better soulslikes that give the same experience with much more enjoyment.",0
Negative,"Righty let me start talking about my love hate relationship with this mess of a game, this is coming from an avid Bloodborne fan that tries to keep things from an objective point of view, I can't guarantee I wont be biased but tough luck, expect me to pull out some comparisons buckos.The combat feels rather more fluid than the previous dark souls games, however it shorts itself with how limitted the weapons feel how they have no ""weight"" to them, most weapons having very basic movesets and hit like wet noodles sometimes. Oh is that the Farron greatsword with a cool moveset? Too bad, mr. ParryGod6969 can easily deflect that with his tinfoil shield.Subjectively, shields are rather dumb. They enforce this turtling element on enemies and players which just causes the illusion of difficulty of waiting for someone to attack. Bloodborne's lack of shields and encouragement of parrying, though easier to perform, creates a more fun, fluid and faster gameplay.The FP bar is the biggest mistake FromSoft ever introduced.Parrying is a mess in this game since the game doesn't exactly telegraph what can and cannot be parried - tried to parry cucks with Zweihander and failed everytime, until I fucking searched up on the WIKI that you can't parry any of the attacks - so you mostly end up flailing your shield awkwardly blocking an attack to then get combo'd and stunlocked by an enemy or invader. Backstabs feel cheap, easy and unrewarding, in Bloodborne you have to charge a heavy in order to get a visceral attack.Balancing is fucking non-existent, unupgraded dark hand can destroy practically any enemy, a lot of weapons you'd think would be powerful actually suck massive schlong so you're ended up using meta weapons. The lack of poise is pretty shit, makes heavier armor pointless other than fashion and most rings are useless, so you end up mostly running Havel's ring, ring of favor, hornet ring and any other thing that's probably considered meta, at least some of the more considerably less effective runes in Bloodborne have some use to them.Gems are pointless and the resources are more so, when running boss or special weapons you cant infuse gems so what's the point? Bloodborne consistently had you use only 1 resource and the gems could be applied to anything and were more versatile then adding a bit of scaling.This is where shit really just goes downhill. Dead ends leading to nowhere, rooms you open with nothing inside and artificial difficulty at it's finest.Not a single zone in this game has peaked my interest, I'm happy to say I hate practically ALL of them. Launching a new character and going to Lothric always give me that sense of the dreaded ""well fuck this place again"" compared to the breath of fresh air I get everytime I appear in Yharnam in Bloodborne. By the time you'd reach the swamp you would want to bash your brains out with how confusing and much of a drag it might be to a new player and probably not even try to go through the pain that is Smouldering Lake. At least the Nightmare Frontier in Bloodborne was left as an optional area to do.Enemies mostly end up being not hard, just time wasting, especially shielded knights in Lothric and Irithyll. There is nothing hard about waiting for an enemy to attack and stop using their shield, you cant break through it without draining your stamina unless you have a UGS, at least Silver and Black knights are considerably more aggressive and more bearable to fight than just waiting for a Lothric spear knight to do another shitty shield bash for you to dodge or get stunlocked on. Some enemies are pointlessly infuriating and annoying, big example are the stupid goo piles in Anal Londo or Smouldering lake, abysmally large health pools with a pointless grab attack that is only harmful to your summon. Enemies sometimes either end up comboing you infinitely or sitting back as if watching a movie, so the AI is pretty much random whether it wants to do anything or not due to the lack of attack patterns. Shielded Pontiff knights are a fucking great example; either they charge at you so you can actually kill the damn thing or end up backing up constantly into a wall idling. Whilst some enemies in Bloodborne did this, they didn't back up against the same wall for 2 minutes straight for a small experiment.Let me get the good ones out of the way;Abyss WatchersDragonslayer ArmourVordtBoth Gundyr'sSoul of CinderDancerThese fights are probably the only ones you could probably remember to be fun to fight against, and the most memorable ones despite their issues. Most of the other bosses just end up being not hard to fight just time wasting and annoying, painfully difficult and unrewarding or just severely underwhelming.Getting the good stuff out of the way we'll start with Gundyr, the first boss of the game being an excellent beginner boss visually and in general being a good fight, well telegraphed attacks and never tries to bulshit you with stunlocks and one shots. Champion Gundyr is a good chance to reflect on what you have learned from playing the game up to his fight, more prepared and a fucking excellent rematch.Vordt is just good, cool soundtrack and amazing visuals as usual.Abyss Watchers is probably the most universally liked fight, and I can see why. They don't feel cheap and bullshit, they're difficult yet fun to pitch yourself against. Closest thing I feel to fighting these guys is Maria from the Bloodborne Old Hunters DLC, and the second phase cutscene does bring flashbacks to Ludwig's own second phase.but why actually fight them when you can just cheese them by stunlocking them with the Black Knight Greatsword? :omegalul:While you usually face off the Dancer later on in the game, you can technically face her off really early and BOI is she a fucking tough cookie, even later on her fight will have to struggle internally pushing you to almost have a mental breakdown thanks to your fragile mental state, and beating her will give you the biggest erection and scream you'll ever have in your life. Her difficulty mainly revolves around how unpredictable she is with her moveset rather than how much damage she deals or how aggressive she is, im contradicting myself here but fuck you beating her felt like I lifted off an entire truck off my shoulders.Dragonslayer Armour is good, nothing much about that other than his difficulty comes from big dick damage.As for the bad apples, Curserotted Greatwood is an example of one of the many bad fights in the game, not necessarily hard, but just annoying to deal with, hitting sacks and dodging simple attacks and then 2 shotting an arm, Wolnir too feels cheap, easy and can be done without a single estus flask, Deacons of the Deep are a joke, just a typical add fight, Old Demon King feels like a rehash of many past bosses FromSoft made, Yhorm is just. sad, a wasted fight, and everything else feels just like a blur.It's garbage. It really is.The net code is bad, invaders are shit, covenants even more shit, summons get one shotted to shit and dare I say how awful is the large part of the community with the ""get gud"" mentality. Invaders end up usually being pests, either killing you or you killing them, an occassional bad player who you feel bad about because he clearly doesn't know the game, a hacker who cares or the good guy who actually doesn't make running through Irithyll or Crucifixtion Woods a living hell (shoutout to Brotron 9000.)TL:DR, this isn't a bad game necessarily, but if you want an introduction to FromSoft games, get yourself DS1 or a ps4 for Bloodborne.",0
Negative,"This may be a good game, but it is not for everyone.The game is made for console and extremely unfriendly for PC players.As for game experience goes, as PC player who try to play with controller, adds more into how 90% of the game is pathfinding and running back after death. 10% of the game is chance to do actual combat. Using mouse can be glitchy, making it unreliable. Boss is extremely easy compared to the path to get there. Mobs hit through walls, whereas you cannot. Enemy arrow go through other mobs and hits player. There is an option to kick in the game, but made extremely hard to use for some reason, unable to change key to simply kick. Autolock only work if very close in proximity.",0

Negative,"Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the game. Bought the dlcs a year later and reinstalled it. Only to realise there are no cloud saves and now I've lost 60 hours of progress :(I really don't understand how FromSoft prices this higher than Elden Ring when it doesn't even support cloud saves. I've literally never had to worry about that until now",0
Negative,"This is probably the most depressing review I have made thus far and it brings me no joy. I have to say I love Dark Souls, I have over 300 hours in Dark Souls 2 and around 100 hours in Dark Souls and yet I could not bring myself to like this game. Well, that is not true, I still like the core that is Dark Souls, but it felt to me as if the gameplay is shifting for a different audience.I think I do not like this game because it does not reward patience and measured approach as in the previous games, the enemies have harder to predict attack patterns, they are much faster and they have infinite stamina in that they are attacking constantly. Which encourages you to attack first and stunlock enemies. You can say that Dark Souls 2 had some hard to predict attack patterns as well (Heide Knights), but with higher speed it is even more blatant in here. This can be very obvious when using parry, since there is a same parry animation as in Dark Souls 2, where it is slightly delayed than in Dark Souls you have to parry a little bit earlier. However since the attack animation is faster than in Dark Souls 2 sometimes you have to predict when the enemy will attack to successfully parry. Maybe it is my fault that my reflexes are not as they used to be and I have actually read in some interviews that players are responding positively to this type of combat, but this is not a game for me. In the same interview I have also read that it is supposed to be high risk/high reward type of gameplay, but I feel that high risk/high reward was actually done much better in previous games, while this one encourages a ceratin way of playing.TLDR: I do not like the highpaced combat, feel as if this is a downgrade over previous games.",0
Negative,"I really enjoyed Dark Souls 2 and Dark Souls 3.They're very unique and great games.I could write about the lore. The writing is GREAT!What is the problem?Cheaters.They can ruin your save files, hack into your PC, or even just take away all the joy from this game.You can play offline, but many fun features of this game were meant for multiplayer, stuff like factions, co-op, boss fighting with helpers or invasions to make people angry.Those things are fun, but cheaters dominate the game. It's impossible to play it, plus I read the news about full control exploit, so .The studio even ignored the problem! The people who discovered it (or 1 person was it?) reported it to them. They didn't even bother to thank them and take care of it!This game is dead. I wanted to play Elden Ring but I am highly skeptical because of all of this.It was a fun game and not too difficult (dark souls 2 was more difficult tbh), but it becomes repeatable and cheaters destroy all the purpose of playing it.",0

Negative,"The positives:Hands down one of the most detailed and breathtaking games visually. I was taken aback at how amazing each enemy design was, each massive area was just epic in terms of scale and beauty. I would find myself lost in these worlds for hours just looking and admiring the level of detail put into the world.Ran well. Didn't have any stuttering or clipping issues. Crashed once but the issue was on my end of things. The negatives:The story.The story.? Well, yes there is a story. A veritable buffet. It's in the locations, the items, the NPC's you find. It's there you just need to find it. Or just read the story that's conveniently found on a few websites here and there. I was hoping personally that a game this visually amazing would have a lot more lore in game to find. Hell I wouldn't even mind text logs found in a *Cough* library in game. But I couldn't find a more direct line of story. Which isn't the worst thing in the world. Hell I prefer games that don't force story in my face. But I had to go a lot more out of my way than I expected to receive context for why I was doing what I was doing.The camera. Please. I want to keep it locked on the enemy. I don't want to look way randomly. No, I don't want the camera to get jealous when an enemy traps me in a corner and teleport to look away from the enemy. Camera. Camera please.And of course the real killer for me, the controls. For all intents and purposes it works.fine I guess. It's as realistic I can expect it to be. Thankfully you can increase your stats and wear armor so you can roll decently well. If not enjoy being open to most every attack when you roll. But I can't help but feel that I'm not playing with the right build on a lot of the enemies when I only do paltry damage compared to their mighty 2 hit kills. I can guess at the number of times I made a single mistake in a boss fight and just died because of it. I enjoy a challenge now and then, but this is a bit much at times. With a bit more polish I would've enjoyed the combat in this much more. I believe the main cause of this being the staggering amount of weapons and spells you can use. No way it can be adequately balanced. Especially seeing the sorcery builds online that kill most bosses in 3-4 hits. So there definitely needs to be some tweaking done there. Sekiro was much better in regards to combat because of this very reason I believe.I only did 2 of the endings before I found myself dreading another playthrough. And that's when I leaned on the decision to stop. When the game stops being fun you should stop playing, naturally.The game was gifted to me, and while I'm thankful for it, I think a gift is where it should stay at. At most I would spend 10 dollars just for the environment alone. But for getting the story and lore? I can watch several videos on the subject and get as much if not more enjoyment from watching others expound on the game.",0

Once you get up to a high enough level(200+) the game is dead. If you're lucky you'll end up having a 1v1 with the same guy until one of you gets bored, then it's back to waiting for more than 30-60 minutes at a time no matter where you try to invade or get invaded. This game in my opinion is STILL terrible and only worth playing if you enjoy an extremely frustrating and challenging experience.

In short, don't buy this game on PC, they just wanna fuck you.I did find out what caused it though in the end. Riot's shitty ass Valorant ""anticheat"" apparently registers as a hack for some games. Be careful and fuck off Riot (and FROM Software, fuck these guys too.)",0
Negative,"Don't get me wrong, I consider this game to be a masterpiece of game design. But be aware that the PC version has a MASSIVE hacker problem. Currently, if you play online hackers are able to inject hacked items into character inventories, and this will cause you to be banned by the games own automated anti-cheat software within a week, even if you immediately delete the character. You can appeal the ban, but it will take close to a month and if it happens a 2nd time it will be permanent. Unless you want to spend a lot of time dealing with third party guard dog software or risk losing all online features, I highly recommend playing the console version instead. And I do highly recommend the game itself.",0
Negative,"My time on this game is way overblown as I leave my computer on all the time, so Im not really sure how long it took, but during quarantine it's easy to lose track of time.Overall, I did enjoy the game but as I got towards the end I was getting tired of the games design and some of the boss and enemy design decisions started getting on my nerves. I know some of these are put in to keep the players on their toes, but eh, it has it's place but DS3 seems to be littered with these decisions. I actually purchased this to see what all the ""Dark Souls is difficult"" talk was about, but on a personal note, I can't say I'd play this again and if I did recommend it to someone, it would be with significant warning.Things I LikedThe ambiance is fantastic and I loved the general feel of the world. The enemies, bosses, and characters all matched perfectly and really made you feel like you were in a dying world. One of the bosses quotes ""This place is our grave, and you can rest here too, if you like."" is so chilling and perfectly defines what this game is about. The enemy variation in this game is fantastic as each level has multiple types, each with different attack patterns, abilities, etc and it really keeps the levels interesting.The weapon designs are awesome and the leveling system feels very fair as the game tends to naturally level you up correctly as you progress. Yes, you could just farm and become OP, but I didn't see a need for that whereas in other games the leveling can be pretty terrible.The combat is pretty visceral and the weapons sound fantastic. I finished my game with a +10 Ultra Great Sword and the sound of that thing hitting an enemy, or even the ground never got old.What I Didn't LikeProgressing Through The LevelsOnce you go through the first few levels you'll understand how to go about ALL the levels. For me, I would move out a little to see all of the games ""surprises"" then go back and heal, which resets the level, and then move out a little further to find out more tricks because my god they are everywhere. This game will have enemies drop from ceilings, pop out of walls behind you, or send out swarms of enemies to impede forward progress so you essentially need to memorize where all of these what I call ""gimmicks"" are before you progress so you have enough HP and Estus (health potions) to fight the levels boss(es). Then, once you find the boss location, it's a matter of running through all of the enemies and slam your head into the boss as many times as it takes to defeat them.GimmicksIll probably get a lot of flack for this, but this was my biggest gripe with this game. Many of the design decisions seemed to revolve around irritating the players versus progressing the story, levels, characters, or even bosses. For example: The bosses have 2 or 3 stages where the first stage tends be to fairly straightforward but then they all have a second infinite stamina hyper aggressive second stage - shoot laser beams, grow huge appendages, multiply, etc. I also felt like a lot of them had cheap mechanics that again, were more to irritate the player than to make them interesting. For example many bosses have attack timings or delayed attacks specifically designed to bait out roles, that if you role too early (or too late), will result in 1/2 your health bar being wiped away. Another example is enemies placed specifically to prevent run throughs (to the bosses) where you can tell an enemy was specifically programmed (jutting out from behind a wall, significantly faster than the other enemies) to interrupt running by just the first time. The last example Ill give is in the rafters in the cathedral level, where they place a knight with a crossbow that has enough power to knock you off to your death if it hits you from a slight angle. The game is littered with these gimmicks so it essentially forces the player to memorize a level's tricks as well as the boss's tricks to complete.Story, Character, Boss DepthI haven't played the other souls games, but this one does almost nothing to make me care about any of the characters, story, or bosses in general (I played the Witcher 3 over Christmas, which was a master class in story telling, character development, and world building). I've read some of the wiki articles but overall, I feel the game just lacks a lot of story telling depth. The game really could have done a fantastic job of using the levels and NPCs to really develop the world far beyond what the fantastic scenery and environment do for it. But hey, maybe that's not what they were going for.Final thoughtsI get why people like this game (and others similar to it), as it does have a lot of depth in the build paths, character creation and development (your character). The game is definitely difficult and the player must be keenly aware of their surroundings at all times, and yes, it does feel awesome to finally beat a boss through practice and trial and error that you've lost to more than enough times (f'in Pontiff). But, I feel the game could have done so much more with the world and stories than what it did, and what it did do, felt so ""Hollow."" This coupled with the general boss design and enemy layout design, I can't say I'd give a profound yes to a friend about playing this.",0
Negative,"Now my opinion might be different since this isn't the typical type of game I play (and I didn't play it for very long because you can only play 2 hours before being unable to refund games) but none the less there are some things I want to point out.First of all and probably the most obvious the controls, or the lack of them.There are no PC/Computer controls ANYWHERE, you have to look it up or else you have no idea, and some of them don't even go over everything. There's also the fact that the PC controls that do exist are not great.I have to right click to get a menu (that still has controller buttons) to exit or something else.It's incredibly clunky and it doesn't make sense for a game with such a high price tag to be on steam if you only know 5 controls on your own, if even that.Then there is obviously the difficulty, how it's completely unfair, and how the hell are you supposed to get a feeling for the game in 2 hours when the first boos probably takes at least 10 esspecially if you've never played a game like this before.(They also had this sale before the summer sale which was 75% off, then when the Summer sale started the price was exactly the same?)I'd say MAYBE get it on a sale, though once again the 2 hours are going to be really pressing, but only do it if you're up for one heck of a challenge and you've played (difficult) games like these before or you're a Souls fan I guess, though you probably already have this if so.It's slow, not my type of game, but I won't discourage you from buying/playing it if YOU so desire.",0

If you want less cancerous PVP, go play DS1.I'll retract my current opinion when the issues this game faces have been resolved, doesn't necessarily have to be all of them.About the PVE. its not DS1 2.0. I don't mind the less connected world. Lots of ambushes (DS2 tier of bad). World design is top notch (great seeing quality of this magnitude after DS2). Lovely animations from DS1, albeit reworked to a small degree. Great soundtrack. Color variety among the levels seem to be lacking, everything looks desaturated.PVE is alright, not many qualms about it. I don't stick around for PVE though.",0

Negative,"Despite not having the best computer, I can still run many games newer games on the highest, to next to highest settings. I have EVERYTHING turned down to either Low or Off with Dark Souls 3, and although it looks worse than most new games I've played, the frame rate is often times horrid, I constantly crash, cannot play online (kicks me for low frame rate and kicks me to the main menu. really, you can't just log me off online? you have to completely drop me out of the game? I don't even want to summon anyone, I just want to read/leave notes ffs), and the intial loading screen into the game takes about 3-5 minutes to complete loading. Very poorly optimized. Would not recommend until this is fixed.",0
Negative,"The game is constantly crashing (day 2 of realease)I have a decent rig, and i could play the game for about 1 hour, or 2. After that my game crashes even on first load. It loads then crashes. I have a AMD FX 6300 and a Asus 750 Ti OC. Overclock on both (cpu to 4100). I just don't know what to do . I tried the set the lighting to low (and the virtual memory ""fix"", and the knight as the character ""fix"", and wearing a helm at all times ""fix"") And everything to low for that matter, which didn't improve framerates AT ALL . How does that work? I'm also running windows 8.1 if that's relevant. All NVIDIA drivers are up to date. This is so disappointing., i was waiting for this realease so much but the crashes on load are just murder. . Is it too late to get a refund? I pains me but i cannot recommend this game on PC.

Negative,"At least half my time in this game was spent trying to get it to stop crashing. I give up. The amount of troubleshooting this game requires to become stable just isn't worth it. Don't get me wrong, it's a great game. But this port is absolute garbage. I've found a seemingly endless amount of posts on various forums complaining about these problems and a concrete solution is nowhere in sight. As a result, the game just isn't worth purchasing in its current state. So unless you have the magic combination of hardware required in order for this game to not crash, steer clear.",0
Negative,"Massive Security Vulnerability. Potentially everyone who played a souls game or the Elden ring beta could have had their pc hacked, banking details stolen, passwords compromised, etc. From Software pretended like this wasn't a thing despite multiple reports and finally started to take action once a white hat got sick of them doing nothing and exposed this vulnerability on a livestream. FromSoftware has handled this very poorly, is dragging their heels, is not transparent about what is occuring and as a result I do not believe people should support them at this time.",0
Negative,"Dark Souls 3 being the easiest of the Dark Souls games is pretty terrible and boring.They tried to make it more like bloodborne as dark souls but it failed by turning into bloodborne but as dark souls. It is not ""hard but fair"" like they try to make it out to be. It is just a trip down memory lane with copy and pasted maps from other dark souls games. Combat is pretty screwed up most of the time with some kind of networking problem on pvp. When my sword hits a player they will often not receive damage until after the second or third time I have physically hit them. The invasions last forever with everyone having a ton of estus and it seems invasions suck for the invaders and those being invaded. Invaders deal with a huge amount of nerfs and when they invade they are put into people's worlds that summoned phantoms first above all. Sometimes as an invader it can be 1vs4 and it is totally possible for them to be hundreds of levels above you since summoned as a phantom . So if you plan on trying to play with a friend, expect every 20 seconds to 2 minutes to be invaded. It wasn't unusual for me to die as a phantom after an invasion and immediately be invaded in my own world. Lothric castle is the first place you can go to start playing with your friends and also it seems the most invaded place with people that have end game gear to kill you as you try to navigate through the maps. Now I understand that people can argue it is totally fair with all the nerfs to go through the whole game as a level 15 character and get endgame gear to invade first time players. Sounds totally fair, because it is the ""dark souls player experience"". I love invasions in dks 2 it was fun and there was a challenge because phantoms couldn't use estus during an invasion, it was more fair and more fun for everyone. But this beginning of the game invasion spam when you are just trying to play with a friend or just happen to be embered is stupid. You might have better luck soloing this area or be doomed to everybody and their momma trying to kill you. My final frustrations with this game are the gimmick and trick combat policy, bosses not playing by the games own rules and how there is not really help at all on direction. The reason this is the easiest of the Dark Souls games is because you can pretty much cheese every boss and if you know the trick to the gimmick then you can basically beat the game without even trying. BUT if you don't know the trick, then it screams and takes a big hot fudge monkey on your face . It doesn't reward you for doing something right, it just punishes you until you guess the trick or look up the trick. I also gotta say, it is super cool to fight multiple enemies, or even just one that have unlimited stamina and do 3-8 hit combos that not only shield break you but break your poise no matter what armor you wear (poise is broken). That means once one hits you, it is possible for everyone else around you to put their combos in. Bosses not playing by the games own rules blows my mind away. The bosses usually have an insta kill attack that can pop out at different times, some bosses do them when at 5% health. They can swing and completely miss you while you are behind them and still get hit, through your shield. Sometimes the game just decides that you die instantly when they miss or walking through the fog gate and hit with an AOE that hits 80% of the map (Old demon king boss). Finally, it is dumb how difficult it is navigating through some places and knowing why you are supposed to be there are unless you google it. It's not a hard game, getting gud just means you found out the tricks online or by yourself . DKS 2 is way better, the third was supposed to fix the new features and tune them, not add on a bunch of things that they have zero interest in improving and go "" oh well, it's the last dark souls anyways so I'll just not care as the game developer about keeping a player base by area banning phantoms and invasions (all multiplayer functions in that area) after the player beats a boss lawl moniesss haha"" Isn't that great? I'd say that is pretty smart, you wouldn't want customers who buy your products to keep playing your games for multiplayer. Various videos circulating youtube on why it is a bad and dying game. I suggest stick to the other dark souls games, this one is just a joke.",0
Negative,"Game has a random chance of crashing every time I kill an enemy in the starting area. Will see if changing the settings around fixes it since I am already playing as the Knight. (which many say fixes the crashing in the first area.) Will change review once game works without crashing. ;w;EDIT: Lowering lighting quality to low helped until I tried to leave the first boss area, which just instantly crashed my game.EDIT 2: after 2 hours of messing around with the settings, I managed to open the first door in the game without crashing. But now every time I kill an enemy the game consistently crashes. This wonderful game experience has now become absolutely unplayable for me.-Lowering lighting to low, using Knight as a starting class, and turning off/downgrading some of the settings does seem to fix the game for a good percentage of the people suffering crashes. Other than that, I've got nothing :/Really this isn't a massive issue to get salty over because the majority of players don't have this issue, but enough players do have this issue to the point that From Software should have caught it. And really, it isn't just the crashing. It's the glitches and the occasional mechanic that fails to work properly that gives the impression that From didn't really spend as much time playing their own game as they should have, even if that may not be the case.Especially after the first two Souls games had issues with both of their releases on PC. It just seems odd that a group with a history successful and amazing game worlds would create a game with these issues. Although I've no idea what the crashing computers all have in common, if you have an excellent gaming computer, I doubt that you'll have any issues with the game. That being said, I'd recommend looking up the glitches online or waiting for the April 18 patch to see if you think it'd be a good idea to buy the game.Or just.buy it for a console system.",0

Negative,"For me personally, this game was a waste of time. Progression is painstakingly slow, 3 steps forward, 2 steps back. And when you finish the game, it ended in a very unsatisfying manor.

Negative,"If you buy these games for the online aspect, do not that at the moment or possibly ever. FromSoft is a typical successful gaming company run by the usual lazy people in this industry, so one of the key aspects might never work on PC without private servers because they keep reusing the same stupid engine and didn't notice a vulnerability in over 10 years. They said a fix is ""pending"" over 4 days ago. When someone contacted them about it, they didn't have an estimate of when it would be fixed. This RCE exploit affects all Souls games, btw. It's just harder to do on consoles right now, but you can bet that will change sooner or later.I get the reuse of assets, animations, etc. I somewhat get the shameless plagiarism of Berserk, but how the hell can you reuse something that has such fundamental issues and not notice it for this long? And all this would have been somewhat excusable if they hadn't been contacted about this issue over 8 months ago. Their response? It was essentially ""we don't care, go away.""

Negative,"DISCLAIMER: this review is specifically written in the context that this game is essentially the fifth in it's franchise, and the third one on PC.Bullet points:+ Beautiful graphics and art direction, environments are incredibly detailed and often even dynamic, and the design of many enemies is jaw-dropping.+ Great bossfights, a big step up from Dark Souls II, this one puts real effort into having interesting bossfights, even if some of them come off feeling gimmicky.+ Fast, and infrequent loading screens- Stale combat which struggles to come up with new mechanics and fails to fix problems that exist since Demon's Souls- Lazy level design, while the world itself is beautiful, most of the levels use very similar structures and gameplay concepts (like having to run through a level while an enemy in the distance shoots projectiles at you, hope you like doing that 'cuz it's what you do in 8 out of 10 levels in this game). Levels also suffer from being too big to be fun or memorable- Uninspired story and lore, this game rehashes the same plot from the first and second game yet again, if that's not going through the motions i don't know what is, the lore is also either poorly thought out, or recycling of old ideas.- Technical issues, similar to Nier Automata, certain GPUs have serious issues running this game, even though they easily surpass the requirements- Ashes of Ariandel DLC is awful, it's short, it's lazy, its boring, and it's easy. it is the exact opposite of the Ringed City DLC.- Bloodborne influence, while Bloodborne itself is a very good game, a lot of design mentalities have been carried over from that game to this one, which, taking into account the difference in mechanics and tone, gives Dark Souls III a strange feeling, like it's lost in a limbo between the first Dark Souls and Bloodborne.- Promises unfulfilled, many early interviews promised a drastic change in structure to previews games, things like placing your own bonfires in the world, different ways of interacting with other players, and more, but none of that is in the game, and only traces can be found of these systems deep in the game files.At the end, all we are left with is same old stale dark souls yet again, only this time this is the actual end, and what a sad end to this franchise it is.Dark Souls 1 was right, no matter how hard you try, you can't keep relighting the same flame forever, all you will get is seeing how, slowly and painfully, it dies away.",0

Negative,"Dark Souls III is certainly better than Dark Souls II in almost all regards except one: Combat.The imperfect and apparently rushed melding of Bloodbourne and Dark Souls combat led to a system that is a chore to get through. A system where nothing except the speed or quantity of attacks matters since there is no poise, but, unlike in BB, also no recourse like quickstepping or parrying from a distance. For the first time in the series, you actually can die without doing anything wrong yourself.",0
Negative,"First off, it's definitely got a lotta core gameplay upgrades from the first game, for example:>holding a direction on the d-pad to auto-revert to the first item equipped in said slot>better dodge-rolling while locked-on and circling a target>being able to burn multiple souls all at onceI've never played the second, so the standard I have to compare this game to is only the first one the trilogy; however, with that said this still feels a bit too derivative of the first game in terms of its themes and storytelling to the point that I don't believe this game could legitimately stand as its own product without having the pedigree of the series itself backing it up.A lot of the areas do look cool, but they don't feel cool playing, especially places like Farron Keep with environments that poison and slow movement.At that point and even beyond I feel like the game is more intent on providing unnecessary difficulty ramps, like pushing the player to fight upwards of 5+ enemies at once despite the game's fighting mechanics clearly favoring methodical one-on-one battles.Stuff like that make you rather wanna turn it off and go back to play the first one despite how flawed it was.As a game it's honestly not that bad, and pretty satisfying at times, even. But looking at it as its own product I cannot recommend it unless you already have a prior investment towards the series, because you're especially not going to be able to invest yourself within the narrative and the world around you just from this alone.",0

Negative,"Quite frankly, I don't think Dark Souls 3 is that bad of a game. The first playthrough in singleplayer was a hell of a lot of fun and I was very excited about it at the time. But everything after my first playthrough has just been a disappointment. * There is no replayability to be found in New Game Plus, unlike Dark Souls 2 it is the EXACT same experience, just with your build carried over, and the difficulty hike is laughable. The only new thing is + versions of rings, which as a result makes going through the entirety of NG++ a highly important thing in PvP whether you want to play the campaign three times in a row or not. * But you shouldn't want to, quite frankly, because the PvP is just not fun. Dark Souls 2's PvP was a blast, I have nearly 400 hours put into Dark Souls 2 as a result. But in Dark Souls 3 it's regressed in so many ways, it's not funny. I'm pretty much done with it, I don't want to play any more of it at this point.* Magic is less fun. There are fewer spells, and offensive magic is incredibly underpowered and basically pointless in PvP. Dark Magic has just been retconned to hell and has as much presence as it did in Dark Souls 1. * The game on the current patch version (1.04.1) has real stutter issues UNIVERSALLY, every player seems to have them (myself included). * The game's cheat protection is still very flawed, and prevents community fixes like PvP Watchdog by Eur0pa and other mods from being developed while contributing little.* There is a reduced selection of weapons compared to Dark Souls 2 and many weapons are completely unviable in PvP, whereas almost any weapon could be viable in Dark Souls 2.* The covenants in the game are uninspired and some don't even work. I've not been summoned once for the blue sentinels or the darkmoon blades throughout my entire time with the game and the only alternative to getting the rewards involves a multitude of hours of soul-numbing farming.* The game rehashes Dark Souls 1's content far too much, while dismissing Dark Souls 2 almost entirely.* It also has almost no original memorable NPCs, the only memorable NPCs in the game are straight from Dark Souls 1. The NPC questlines are also another level of convoluted, they take the cryptic nature of the souls series too far.* One of Dark Souls 2's main criticisms was the regressed level design, relying on bonfire warping instead of intricate shortcut based interconnected levels. While Dark Souls 3 makes much more sense geographically, the level design suffers from the same issue. Memorable shortcuts are countable on one hand. * Power stancing has been ditched, making dual-wielding any weapons other than the pre-designed dual-wielded weapons completely useless. While a few of the special dual-wielded weapons are quite cool, they do nothing that couldn't've been done with power stancing left in place. * The game also seems strangely cpu-reliant. My framerate is sub-60 in a lot of areas on an i5 4690k @ 4.5GHz and a Sapphire Tri-X R9 290, and turning down the graphics from maximum to minimum has little-to-no effect on my framerate. I think my cpu should be perfectly powerful enough to run the game at 60 frames per second, but what do I know.All in all, there's a rant for you. If you're a souls fan no doubt you've already bought this game. And if you intend to make this game your first Dark Souls experience, I imagine you'd have a lot of fun with it as I did during my first playthrough. So I don't think this review will be useful for a lot of people. But I still wanted to write it, if anything just to vent my frustrations with the game somewhere.",0
Negative,"Edit: My responses to comments are located in the comments. Sorry for the inconvience!I really don't want to write this review. I really really want to give this game the ol' thumbs up. But I just can'tDark Souls 3 is, suprisingly enough, the third game in From Soft's Dark Souls series. It takes the dark fantasy themes from the pervious games and puts them into a whole new world, with the callbacks to the past you would expect after Dark Souls 2.Interestingly enough, this is the first Dark Souls game I finished without taking a break. I stll haven't completed Dark Souls 1, and only finished Dark Souls 2 after taking a long multi month break. I find the gameplay in the Souls series to get dull fast, where each fight breaks down to roll-parry-hit-repeat. I do love the visuals, sound, and story of the games, which keep drawing me back. Dark Souls 3 is by far the prettiest of the 3, being the most recent. I can spend time just walking around, trying on different armors to see how they look. The music is as great as I have come to expect from a From Soft game, and the sounds of the swords and spells are the familiar ones from the pervious games.The areas are also well designed, a mixture of seemingly realistic architecture mixed with challenging gameplay. In particular, the Cathedral of the Deep was exceedingly well done, reminging me of the Undead Burg from Dark Souls 1. Enemies are placed intelligently, as if they actually live in and defend their areas, and you can often use the terrain to our advantage if you stop to look and think about it, which is a boon to a filthy casual like myself.Unfortunantly, beyond aesthetics, Dark Souls 3 left me dissapointed. I won't rant about the poor balance or the lack of poise, others have talked about that at length. Magic is still bad and bleed is insane, frostbite is impossible to afflict and worthless. These are all problems with the game. I want to talk about something different, because you can read about those anywhere. Dark Souls 3 felt very repetitive to me. Every area seemed to break down into a normal enemy, a ranged enemy, a caster enemy, a tank enemy, and some sort of miniboss enemy. Outside of bosses, each area felt like a reskin with the difficulty amped up. Now I know that thats not exactly true, but its extremely close. I never had to vary to tactics to the enemy or switch my resistances; I also never had to use the status resist or purge items. There were a few very small areas that were different - the Consumed King's Garden comes to mind - but they were very small and easilly missed. The sheer power of some weapons relative to others also stagnated my build (I beat the game as a pure faith caster spamming the upgraded Gnaw spell) to the point where I never upgraded my equipment beyond cosmetic changes after I was about halfway through.Bosses are the highlight of the Souls series, and Dark Souls 3 did not dissapoint. Each boss looks and sounded amazing, boss areas were well done and bonfires were placed close enough that nothing felt like a slog. Unfortunantly, after discovering the strategy to each boss, the fights were trivialized. I never felt that my ability to execute a strategy was being tested, and high health bars only slowed the process down. By the time I reached the final boss, he couldn't even reach me to land a hit before my extremely high damage brought him down.The true nail in this game's coffin to me is From Soft themselves. I am going to put in a link to the official path notes for an update.http://i.imgur.com/XFB3OvK.jpg?1Yeah. This is inexcusable. This patch came out when the majority of the community was complaing about the dark sword and the estoc, but neither of those weapons were touched. From Soft has repeatedly shown that they do not listen to the community and do not know how to balance this game. I wanted to like it so bad, but From has ruined any joy I could get from this game by my knowing that they made it. I do not own, and do not intend to own, the Ashes of Ariandel DLC content for this game. Please watch a playthough of the DLC if you plan to purchase it. After months of work, it takes only 2-3 hours to finish. I don't want to discuss the DLC more, because this review is not about the DLC. I mention it only to show that From Soft is not the developer I used to love. I would not reccomend purchasing this game if for no other reason then to show that you do not support the direction they are going. I personally will not be buying another From Soft game.Overall, I rate this game one thumb down. Dark Souls 3 is an ok game tied down by poor design and even poorer support.",0

Negative,"I'm actually quite envious anyone even gets to the title screen. My game crashes without it even starting, yet i'd already logged in 15 minutes of gameplay. Refunded, nothing more i can do. Don't have a ps4 or xbox one. here comes the waiting all over again",0
Negative,"I am sure it is a great game and will be spectacular but YET another game where it has not been thoroughly tested on pc. Dare I say consoles are the future hopefully not another batman on our hands here! I do not have a lot of faith when you pre load the game only to wait until another update goes on and still a lot experiencing crashing. I have a 980 card and it crashes so poorly optimized springs to mind. Getting somewhat tired of the "" my game works fine so lets all be happy"". They have had plenty of time to get this game hyped and released properly however sadly lacking on the latter.",0
Negative,"We've waited years for the next Souls Game, especially after they decided to let Sony milk Bloodborne and leave the PC community high and dry. Now we finally get a new Souls game, and the damn thing is unplayable. I can run the graphics fine, my rig is more than capable, but the crashes have made the game impossible to play. Literally, like clockwork, same crash, same location.How is this acceptable? We paid good money, and this is what we get? When a patch goes out, I'll change this review when I can ACTUALLY PLAY THE GAMEEDIT: Well, figured out how to progress. I had to kill myself. Whatever bug had me locked apparently tied to being in Cinder Form. If that continues to be an issue I will be pissed, but for now I can play. Switching my review to positive as the game itself is VERY fun.EDIT: Nevermind, I was wrong. Crashes kept occuring. Sure, I could progress past that point, but then every 5-10 minutes, another crash. Game is a mess right now, do not buy until it's fixed.",0
Negative,"cant recommend it if you are using keybord and mouse.i have played through Dark souls remastered and had a fun time with it.i put it off becouse of how hard it was supposed to be, the only boss fight i hade troble with was Ornstein and Smough, i dont know if I out leveled the dlc bosses but didnt give me to much troble - soul lvl 99 hade black knight sword +5, but what i realy found difficulte was the world - think i died more to fail rolls of clifs and taking a wrong turn or trying to figure out where to go next.So i thouge i would give darksouls 3 shot - played 6 hours and i cant take anymore the camera keeps getting me kill when you fight the camera more then the enemys and the keybinds shows as controller when using keybord and mouse, it just felt like its a waste of time when its the camera thats in control of you winning or losing a fight.the pc port just seems like they phoned it in or they didnt care - atlest with the controlls for pc - just not worth my time and cant recommend it if you use keybord and mousegonna try and refund it. while i wait for it im gonna play Dark souls remastered new game+",0

Negative,STR builds no longer viable.,0
Negative,"It is unfortune that i have to write this review, because some elements of this game were fun; however, the co-op part of the game doesnt have an overlay so u can talk to people in game, and the usage of magic is next to worthless. All and all, this game gets 3 out of 10 stars.",0
Negative,"I'd reccomend this game to anyone who wanted to be mad at themselves for not being good enough for a task. The worst part is the community. Whenever someone's out there asking for help, the toxicity of the public would usually reply with something such as ""git gud"". I strongly urge anyone to stay away from this game. If you want to go through rage, anger, and fight unfair bosses like the Abyss Watchers over and over and over again, step right up, but don't say I did not warn you first.(lol)",0

Negative,this game sucks big peepee,0
Negative,"Terrible experience on PC with Keyboard & Mouse only. They ported it really badly for the PC, don't buy it if you plan to use Keyboard/Mouse.",0
Negative,this game is like putting a toothpick in ur urethra and then miyazaki comes and tells you youre a bitch,0
Negative,im legit afraid of this game,0
Negative,if you dont like this kind of game this will not change your mind. I literally cannot make progress. if you die over and over you lose access to experience points and its just a never ending cycle unless you stop and just play the game exactly correctly. i have dexterity problems with my hands and there is no option for any kind of accessibility. the few times i made forward progress provided zero satisfaction. everyone is a fallow sack of shit and the world is unbearable. fuck this game and the whole series.,0
Negative,"Don't get me wrong. The game irtself is excellent and I'm getting it for PS4. But the PC version crashes every 5 minutes, and as we all know the Keyboard and Mouse setup is once again total garbage that makes a Souls type of difficulty completely unplayable.As for controllers, you need a proper XBox wired controller for this, whether One or 360. PS4 controller requires an emulator (DS4Tool recommended to not have to worry about multiple controller detections and spinning camera). I think it's incredibly lazy to not develop a proper control scheme for the PC version, instead relying on people to pay extra for a controller (which by NO Means is something a PC player would necessarily own).So by all means, get this game for XBOne or PS4, but DO NOT buy this for PC/Steam (if only because of the constant crashes, since you can workaround the controller issue - in fact with DS4Tool my PS4 controller worked very nicely).",0
Negative,"Everything looks like its running at 60 fps but playing back at 24fps so its all smooth but slow as hell with a 2+ second delay. I thought it was my machine, but Dark Souls III auto detected me onto high settings, and I know myself that it can fulfill more than the minimum described. Even then I changed to low settings and nothing changes but now everything looks like shit. Light glitches all over the place, looks kind of like lightinings going off every couple seconds, and the shaders glitch in and out on certain terrain objects (grass tufts especially).I want to play this game, but it doesn't seem to want to be played which, for a student who just shelled 40 buying it, is really irritating.EDITIf I could give it another thumbs down, I would. I'm not sure what happened but the game is stook in a boot loop, even after reinstalling it. Thanks guys, now I can't even play your shitty running game if I wanted to, which I do.a lot.",0
Negative,"I really tried to like this game. I played through Bloodborne and loved it because it was challenging but fair. This game is infinitely more difficult than Bloodborne and is borderline unplayable. The parry system is incredibly vague and inconsistent, as are enemy hitboxes. It is less about avoiding enemy attacks and more about avoiding the several feet of air around their weapon when it strikes. The lock-on system is also pretty rough. After killing an enemy, you remain forcibly locked on to them throughout their death animation, leaving you open to attacks. The enemies in Bloodborne were aggressive, but nowhere near as aggressive as the enemies in this game, which makes it incredibly frustrating when the game systems constantly sabotage the player. Super disappointing.",0
Negative,"It shows me buttom prompts for controller, which would not be a problem. if i weren't playing with mouse+keyboard.",0

Negative,No cloud save.,0
Negative,It's the 21st century - you should be able to generate button prompts for keyboard+mouse layout by now. i'm not buying a game for pc to play with an xbox controller.,0
Negative,"I have a laundry list of reasons not to like this game, but I'll sum it up with this:Bad PvP design, especially compared to DS2.Linear area progression structure prevents subsequent playthroughs from having variety.Stat setup that biases the player towards using Raw enchants and stacking HP/Stamina.",0
Negative,"This would be a good game if it wasn't interrupted every 15 minutes by an invasion that literally cannot be stopped. I do not care to get good at PVP so I can enjoy the PVE, and the game doesn't give you a choice. Want to play with your friends? Nope, screw you, you get to get invaded and die to another player and have to go recover your souls because we said so. I am uninstalling to go play something more worth my time. Yes I understand that PVP is a big part of this game, and I don't want it to be removed, but let the players who want to play it as a PVE co-op adventure game do so, not requiring us to die every time a player invades.",0

Negative,"the pc port is fucking awful and an embarassment, I can t play anymore because my screen flickers and I know theres a way to fix this, but I dont undertand how AND it shouldnt be my jod to fix this",0
Negative,"Easy game, I killed first boss. Stepped to next area, got invaded and the invader sent me to NG+So. I technically beat the game?",0
Negative,"It appears as if they abandoned the servers to save a few bucks. This game used to be amazing and I was really looking forward to the PC experience when I bought it. Inflating the price and charging so much for a 7 year old game with more than half of the fun removed, just because Elden Ring is doing so well, is absolutely slimy!Too bad I had some misplaced faith in the devs to fix the bug and reopen the servers in a reasonable amount of time and missed the return window. Waste of money, not even close to worth it. Just watch Elden Ring videos on YouTube for free.",0
Negative,"Worst experience I've had with a game yet. I played 12 hours of this game. I enjoyed it, was having a blast. Beat the Deacons and it made me consume an ember, which allowed others to invade. Then, Flipper the hacker decided to invade, hack my game and send my level 40 to a new game plus. I was in the catacombs and was sent right back to the beginning. Yup. that's what you pay for folks. To whoever that is, Fuck you. I want my money back this has to be a sick joke. Don't buy this garbage game.",0
Negative,"The controls and camera in this game are absolute dogshit. The hardest part of this game is dealing with the camera angles always fucking you over at the exact wrong time. Every time I kill an enemy my camera locks into a 360 around my character and I am unable to stop it until the game's shitty code decides I'm ready to have control of my camera again. There are many other glitches and bugs, but that alone makes this game unplayable. The combat is not smooth at all. For some reason my guy keeps randomly locking into a kick animation during fights when I'm not even touching wasd keys. If I attempt to dodge an attack and I time it wrong, my character will dodge after the attack has hit me and put me on the ground and I've then stood up, which after all that time allows the boss to hit me again which is a death sentence. An enemy's attack should break my attempted dodge animation, not wait until I've been hit, put on the ground, then stand back up, then continue the buffered dodge animation. This is only one example of how buffered command animations absolutely screw you over in this game. It's not because it's hard, it's because the game is coded poorly. I would not ever recommend this game to anyone.",0
Negative,8 hours.I'm so trash I can't get past the first boss (Iudex Gundyr). I hate it here mom.,0
Negative,"if you like your stable mental health and value your peripherals, do not play this game.",0
Negative,"Let me start off by saying this is a great game. Honestly, the world and lore painted in this game is unlike anything else. That being said, I've been following this game since infancy and From still havent addressed regional play or done much to deal with the hackers. I'd dare say dealing with hackers has only gotten worse over the years. This isn't the first iteration of dark souls nor any souls borne game so why hasn't anything been done? Being able to get banned when hackers drop you items or modify your files is stupid; invasion balance on top of the fact its being more and more common to invade into a world with or by hackers really kills this game. These points may not seem related but in my experience 80% of the hackers I run into are from a very specific country, one I shouldn't even be connecting to to begin with. The fact that cross region play only applies to Japan? Fix it.",0
Negative,absolutely fucking bullshit customer support. so I never liked the dark souls series to begin with. But it started to grow on me. A friend bought me this game as a gift so he could play it with me. I made my character and we began playing. a couple weeks go by and this is where things went south. one day I logged on to play with said friend and before I even Joined his game I noticed every single stat i had was maxed. this obviously wasn't normal. I then decided that something was wrong and chose to erase the game file and start over. no big deal as I was getting used to the game remembered that i needed to do to get back to where i was. after i hit the main menu I received a message saying I have been penalized. then to make things worse My friend could no longer join me. I only played the game for the co op. after searching I found out it was a ban and contacted customer support only to be told I violated some EULA thing and my account was perma-banned. WHAT THE FUCK? something that wasn't even my fault ruined the entire experience for me. I guess what I'm saying is if your willing to run into a bug and get banned for it then by all means waste your money on this game. I could never recommend a game that the devs blame the player for something that wasn't their fault. The game was OK until this happened.,0
Negative,"It's a good game but it brings almost nothing new to the table same bosses, same areas, it's like I'm playing DS1 again but with better graphics and a worse map. Underwhelming.",0
Negative,my quivering butthole couldn't handle this game.,0
Negative,"i did try to like this game, seriously. but i just end up always comparing it to dark souls 2 and i seriously loved ds2. (you might not understand my pros/cons if you didn't play ds2) tldr at the endwhat i didn't like:1- no bonfire ascetic. this was seriously one of the best feature from dark souls 2. why do i need to restart from the start just to rekill the boss i liked? i cleared the first zone so many time that i'm sick of seeing and doing it -.-2- chest? no it's not a chest it's a damned micmic. whats the point when 90% of the chest are actually micmic? there's no surprise anymore. i never got caught by a micmic even once in ds3, while in ds2 (about 10% of chest were micmic) got me everytime 3- probably one of the most ragequit point: 2 zone in particuliar are so ""well"" hidden that there's no way in hell you will find them without checking on internet (small spoiler ahead) pray next to a random statue (seriously?!) kill a npc that gave an important item (what?)3- some monster are ridiculously hard while other are easy. -cough dog cough- probably died more from dog than any other monster4- miracle are so bad. you can't spam them like you used to do in ds2, just imposible. and the damage from lightning spear is horrible until end game5- invasion can be so stupid sometime (more like the people invading) they will do all in their power to kill you, even the most idiotic/coward thing you can imagine6- mana estus (potion). skill should have been using stamina like ds 27- stats/build feel plain. i created many character and there's not one i could say ""yeah this is the one, i like my character"". removed a stats i liked very much (adaptabiity) and instead added luck8- vitality is underwhelming. for one, poise is broken. two, each stats give 1.0 of equip load and when you finish the game you are around level 90 (which doesn't offer much stats) while in ds2 vitality gave 1.5 of equip load and you finished the game at level 2209- (yes there's more) no freedom with dual sword. you can't dual any sword you want anymore like ds2 which could bring awesome combo. dual sword are made dual and you deal with it cause there's isn't a tons of them.there's a lot more i could say but the rest are just minor detailswhat i like:1- armor/texture design and graphic overall2- weapon animation & skill, especially the quick draw from katana3- the challenge different boss offeredtldr: if like me you loved ds2 and hesitating to buy ds3 then don'tif you like souls serie overall and didn't particularly like ds2, go aheadif you are new to souls serie, i'd recommand starting elsewhere because the difficulty is quite higher than other souls game",0

Negative,"Multiplayer is working again now, so you can feel free to read my rant or ignore it.Bought the game years ago to play it with my friends. We've never got the time to actually play it together until now, but it seems that the multiplayer is not working, most likely because of Elden Ring, but who knows for sure. Thanks FromSoftware, it seems I will be playing the game alone.I know that the game is designed to ""hate you"" but this goes a bit too far.Anyway, putting everything aside this game is not as punishing as the previous ones.I guess that most of the people have the game already anyway, but if you consider buying it you might better just fulfill their wish and skip this game and buy Elden Ring instead.",0
Negative,"Bull shit souls 3 sums it up, a regular mob even alone is more dangerous than a Heir of Fire or a Lord of Cinder (aka Abyss watchers and the others), and that should tell you how much sense this game makes. This game is filled with areas that are pure bull shit just to make you die more and make your life hard for no reason, the ""git gud"" mentality is just as much of a bullshit as the community it developed and the other games it sadly inspired. ""git gud"" losses it's point and meaning when the camera and rng works against you, this you can clearly see if you watch the ""souls-like"" veterans who die as well to random bullshit be that from the opponent they face or other sources. If you want proof, just look up how many have bought the game vs how many have finished it, and that should tell you all you need to know.The weapons in the game are also a joke, there are a few that scale with your attributes but so far, most don't scale, this includes the weapons that you would get from the solus of the bosses defeated.Graphics and soundtrack 10/10Gameplay 3/10",0

Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through."" I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this game's PvP gave me cancer anyway.",0
Negative,"FPS makes the game unplayable. INTERNET FIXA lot of people are reporting low frame rates in Dark Souls 3 even with hardware that is above minimal requirements. Some have gone as far as to test the game at 800x600 resolution with low settings and still their FPS wouldn't improve.This looks like a problem with the PC port and should be patched in a future update,I have a high end computer with 16 gigs ram and can play games like skyrim, Dragon age, Black desert online all on max settings. I can't play this game at all even if i turn down the game to minimum settings in windowed, BEWARE BEFORE BUYING",0
Negative,"Rolling is too powerful, fast weapons are the only viable builds, and poise only works when you're mid swing. I love darksouls, and while this title has a lot of polish and fun moments, the issues above may seem minor, but actually monumentally destroy the experience for a seasoned player, making ds3 the weakest of the series.Won't recommend until the problems are fixed. (so never)",0
Negative,"I'll be breaking this review up into two sections, Single-Player and Multi-player. Although, take this review with a grain of salt due to the fact I may be favoring the earlier games, but do keep in mind the amount of time I've put into this game.Single-PlayerThe Single-Player is one of the most enjoyable but frustrating experiences you'll have in gaming. The boss fights are wonderfully designed to give you a challenging but rewarding fight that makes you actually have to learn the patterns and ways the boss fights. The areas around the game give a sense of progression and allow you to see more of the world you're in. Oh yeah also, lore.Multi-Player:Out of these two segments I'd have to give Multi-Player a worse rating. The PvP is an utter mess at the moment due to the fact instead of using the usual ""poise"" system From Software has completely disabled it and instead uses a newer but less reliable ""hyper armor"" system, to put it simply, Greatswords Ultra Greatswords anything similar to it are unstaggerable on most of their move sets except for some exceptions but weapons such as Straight Swords are unable to get any unstaggerable frames making using a Greatsword more meta and makes a fight where its a Greatsword V.S Straight Sword horribly unbalanced and the hyper armor system could use some reworking. Beside PvP the online community is mostly helpful and people will put their signs down in-front of boss rooms if you need help just like any over souls game.If From Software makes any positive changes to the new hyper armor system or just general PvP improvements I will edit this review and take the new changes into account.",0
Negative,"yeah okay I see how it iswhen DS2 throws in lame DS1 fanservice and has a load of dudes in armor for bosses it's a terrible sequelbut when DS3 drowns you in that lame fanservice with no original ideas and has loads of boring samey bosses that, despite aesthetic differences, play the exact same, IT'S GREEEAAAAAT",0

Plz fix your game From.Besides that it was regular soulsy fun, 10/10 if it wasn't crashing on me and shitting all over my chest",0
Negative,"I am a huge fun a Dark soul, and I am so excited about this one. However, it crashed so many times during the game. My friend has same problem. I cannot even enjoy the game right now, so pissed off. PLz, someone tell me what is going on, and how to fix it. Thankyou very much",0

Negative,"Having seen this game and the high acclaim recieved from a variety of crititcs, I cannot in good faith, reccomend anyone to play this game at this current time due to the downright awful framerate and awful,frequent crashes players are experiencing.Having dropped a hefty sum on this game including the season pass, it's an awful shame the ""Bamco"" team released a game with so many problems.The real sad part is due to the lack of actual solutions given by the company, players have banded together in an attempt to offer fixes for all the problems one experiences in the game at this point in time such as the currently infamous bonfire crashing.The irony is, had I not picked the Knight class as I did in Dark Souls II, my gaming experience would have been significantly worse due to the associated crashes with the lighting effects.Overall, while the game was a dissapointment upon release, we can only hope the issues are patches as soon as possible with performance improvements.",0

Negative,"Obviously this game is one of the biggest games of our time. The fact however, that you can't integrate a proper controls settings for PC players is just utterly stupid.

Negative,"Before I write my review of the game, I just want to say that the negative review doesn't go towards the game itself, but towards publisher bandai namco. you namco, I bought the game so I should be able to play it wherever I want, even if I use GeforceNOW, but you just had to ask for it to be removed.Dark souls 3, ah yes, the dankest soul game. One of my personal favourite games. I enjoy everything from the hidden lore, gameplay mechanics (be it obsucred or not), the t, pvp, boss battles, area design, enemies. This game is basically just the greatest porn in my opinion.If you're not a game journalist level gamer, you will enjoy this game a lot. You will easily sink 60h+ as long as you don't spend 4 hours on the first boss of the game and quit after as many people do.This game allows you to play it in any way u like. Wanna be a mage? Go for it. A warrior with a big sword? Griffith here I come. A naked guy throwing poop and poison daggers at players? yeah, why not.Combat: 9/10Absolutely the most fair Souls game in the series. As long as you have a good memory and get used to rolling around it won't be that hard, but it will still remain challenging due to different dodging times for each enemy.Weapon combat feels good, nothing too crazy, but you won't see x600 hit combos as this game is all about managing your green stamina bar.Magic combat is also decent enough, whilst spells take a while to cast, and don't deal crazy amount of damage (except Great Soul Dregs, damn, that spell be crazy man, easily 2.5k dmg on dark enemies at sl 50 kekw) but it allows you to clear some troublesome enemies from a range. But it won 't allow you to outright cheese the game since your mana is limited. A good mechanic nevertheless, very fun, very good for pvp.The only reason I'm giving 9/10 is that Miyazaki hid poise inside the chest under Rosaria's bed, and because bows are big suck.Graphics: 10/10 ing stunning. Take a screenshot at pontiff arena (also known as gonk city) with the moon and you'll see what I'm on about.PvP 10/1010/10 would twink and spank ganks again.Music 10/10Music in this game is so great, Amadeus Mozart probably makes remixes of the boss music in the afterlife. Sometimes when i play other games and there's a boss fight, I will turn off the sound, go to youtube, put any dark souls 3 boss music, then enjoy a true fightReplayability 10/10U can always figure out a different build, a different style to play the game (speedrun, no hit, no death, no weapons, etc) in order to keep it fresh.Map Design 9/10Whilst linear, map design is really good, with enemies and traps placed in good places that will keep the game possible to be played without ever getting hit whilst still keeping the game very challenging for the average joe. There's also a ton of items to be discovered, which each offer a different perspective into the lore, just read their description.Lore 10/10If you bring a little crab into the catacombs the legendary crab merchant will appear. Trust me. DEEPEST LORE.NPCs Voice and Lines 10/10Ashen one, I serve thee ( )But yeah, this game is too good for this world, I would write more but I'm bored, gonna go order a pizza. Also take note that my hours don't reflect my actual hours in game, I played this game mostly on ps4. Don't forget to indulge in jolly co operation my fellow friends, but don't get too mad if you get invaded and killed.

It's beautiful, plays well, and has some great moments, but the world design and story are huge letdowns. The game feels like it lost it's spark and doesn't have anything new or interesting to say. So much of the game is just rehashes of what came before.Also, the DLC is the first that FROM has put out that has not been outstanding. It's fine, don't get me wrong, but DS1, DS2 and Bloodborne all had what I would consider to be the best DLC in the industry. This falls far short of those.",0
Negative,"It's difficult and online is the worst sh1t I have ever seen, you have to write something on the ground to 'summon' the friend you would like to play and if he dies, you have to go ALL the way to the guy that sells white stone thingy so you can go write text on ground and summon your friend again. recommend for people that like challenges but playing with a friend you can forget it, have fun writing name on ground 1000 times back and forth. stupid.",0
Negative,"they disabled family sharing. no more fun with friends without worrying about getting banned because the devs didn't bother to put in an anti cheat that actually works. so yeah, if you want to play this online find some mods that will help fight hackers. and yes, f**k you bandai namco.",0

Negative,"I tried to play with my friends some Dark Souls 3 :D. It was a lovely spring evening. The weather was warm and we were having fun playing some Dark Souls 3 :D. Then we got invaded by a player. He seemed a bit overpowered and he managed to kill us all. We were sad but we decided to get better at the game. :) Then we got invaded by another overleveled player. Ok we tried to fight him but again we lsot because we were at the beggining of the game. After 10 minutes we were invaded by another and then by another and then i decided to uninstall this shit game and play something that is close to being fair. Not to mention that all the virgins that invaded us, also used emotes after killing opponents that had 100 levels under them. Great game mechanic bandai namco, great invade system, Thank god there are not many virgins who abuse the invade sistem :)",0
Negative,"Something happened with my game, which required me to completely uninstall my game and delete my save game data because the game was giving me warning that I had irregular data. I lost only (_ONLY_) twelve hours because of this, but being threatened by a developer because errors in their game, while constantly being plagued by people in multiplayer who are clearly cheating (invincibility, unlimited estrus flasks, weapons far outside of the ""SL"" range) is beyond frustrating and clear evidence of heavy handed tactics like this which punish legitimate players, while not stopping harmful players.It's the worst of both worlds.",0

Negative,F*ck you Sekiro.,0
Negative,"one of the worts games i have ever played, stupid shitty bosses are impossible and there is nothing actually enjoyable about the game. Controls are some of the worst i have ever seen. This game was made for console and should be left there. Didnt even bother to change the controls for pc which is sad and depressing",0
Negative,"ABSOLUTELY the worst of the dark souls games.The game's visuals are nice. That's about it. The story is contrived and doesn't follow it's own rules, the gameplay is the most uninspired of any of the games. I'd argue this is the most uninspired fromsoft game altogether.If you think hitboxes from some enemies in ds2 were bad, well this game basically picks the same issue, and gives it to half the roster of bosses in the main game (incase you didn't realize it, it's the fire. The fire visuals they use are never as large as the hitboxes they're connected to, so even thought the attack may clearly miss you, if there's any fire there, well you better hope you're a mile away otherwise the game will just randomly decide ""fuck you. you still get hit""). Take away the only saving grace from ds1 and 2, poise, and you get to enjoy getting stunlocked if you so much as get sneezed on. You can get ""super armor"" but that involves specific attacks with specific weapons and specifically relies on you trying to trade damage. in a game in which enemies do so much damage at times that you literally CANNNOT TRADE. You trade, you die. That's always been the case in previous ones, it's the case here too, and yet some weapons specifically RELY on you trading. This pretty much means instead of being able to pick how you wanted to play? yeah instead those weapons are for pvp only. don't you dare use them for the main gameplay loop.Instead of doing anything original with the theme, nearly everything is just copy-catting ds1, which after how much stuff ds2 copy-catted ds1, that's shocking that they were able to copy-cat even harder.tl:dr. anything good about ds1 or 2? throw it all out the window. this game lumps up the absolute WORST of both games, and shoves them together, and fromsoft fans eat it up like it's gold. I've played demon's souls, dark souls, dark souls 2, sekiro, bloodborne, you name it. This. is without a doubt. the worst.",0
Negative,"This game is basically a test to see if you can push buttons fast. There isn't really anything else to the game besides figuring out how to push buttons at just the right time. It should state plainly that it is designed 100% around a console controller. Even if you use keyboard and mouse, all the help tips and menu choices use and reference a controller. The story is barely there. A tired, drug out continuation of the previous fantasy dystopia.Literally, the most disappointing game I have ever purchased in my life and I used to QA for Sierra Online so that should tell you something.",0

Negative,"Dark Souls III is good, but not without it's problems, and ultimately better games exist, even among ""soulslikes,"" as we've come to call action games with slow, precise combat, weapon variety, and large bosses, among other things.The game can sometimes have issues running on even lower graphics settings, though this will vary by computer. I have a fairly decent setup and it still drops frames sometimes. If you're new to PC gaming, you'll want to check somewhere online if your computer can run it or go in expecting frame drops. Other than that, new players will have a solid action experience that may be frustrating but is generally well-designed and fulfilling. If you've never played a souls game before, don't worry about it, this is a fine starting point for the series.That said, returning players will probably have some issues with the game. There are numerous quality-of-life issues that you might find frustrating, like menus force-closing after using items, or not properly explaining what weapon infusions do within the game. The FP system is handled a little awkwardly, and that some skills use durability and others use FP can sometimes feel confusing. There's no option to choose whether a shield will parry or use a weapon skill when L2 is pressed, and lots of weapon skills are worthless in PvE, PvP, or both. Magic and ranged weapons still haven't really been balanced for. Oh, and poise. Poise only works on heavy weapons during certain frames of certain attack animations, and is entirely gone on light builds. The only thing poise is good for is tanking through hits while swinging a greatweapon, which many players will find frustrating, especially those fond of dexterity builds. Good ideas from previous games are dropped for no clear reason, like Power Stance from DS2 and infusion gems from Bloodborne. Ultimately, the game plays like Dark Souls 1 with better rolling and warping, but without the structured level design. Fans of the series will probably enjoy it, and should definitely get it while it's on sale.But, there are better games out there. I'm not going to include a full review for it here, but Nioh is a much more solid ""soulslike"" game with deeper and more complex combat options, that handles magic much better and has a much more enjoyable and coherent story. If you like the action of Dark Souls, I highly recommend you get Nioh instead of 3, if you're pressed for cash. TL;DR: It's a fine game, but you're better off waiting for a sale, and even better off getting Bloodborne (if you own a PS4) or Nioh for a similar, but much better game. I wish I had an option between ""recommend"" and ""don't.""",0
Negative,"Local Lord of Sunlight continues to ruin literally everything.Edit: After playing through NG+2 in order to get all the rings for the Dark Soul achievement, I have changed my mind and now despise this game. If you genuinely think this is a good game, you are a genuine low-IQ smoothbrain and don't deserve to be alive. If Dark Souls 2 is bad game design, this one is a good example of lazy game design. Everything about this game other than the music and the graphics feels like somebody just pulled stuffout of a hat, threw it in another hat, shook it around, and dumped it out and went ""ehhh, good enough, the morons that buy this game will be too busy posting about how good it is on reddit and going 'woah, is that a hecking DS1 referencerino?

Negative,"I don't like this game, its better than most but not the best, its good at the start of the game and then it drops off at farron keep or after the curse rotted wood. the best boss was champion Gundyr for me at least, there were some other good to decent bosses, but most of the other ones are terrible because they don't stop attacking almost becoming a turn based game. I loved DS1 and DS2, but the amount of DS1 areas/references. Take reviews with a lot of thought, because most of them lie about stuff like the fact that this game is the gankiest in the series like Irithyll and Archdragon peak, and nobody seems to notice, because this game doesn't require as much skill because you're character gets more cardio than you'll ever get while playing through this game because running is the most viable strategy for every area. it looks like shit too, it looks like plastic. not for me at all.",0

Like the kick. Sometimes i lunge and sometimes it does the kick. That is the only reason for putting me off playing it.

Negative,"PvP in this game is utterly destroyed by the lack of dedicated servers. For single player, it's enjoyable and well crafted, however it has the weakest campaign of all the souls games, and borrows heavily from DS:1 which was far superior.",0
Negative,"Dark Souls III have been praised as a video game classic, but it is by no means a perfect game, and the faults of this game are often overlooked due to the status of it being a Dark Souls game, with any complaints regarding game design receiving an answer of just ""git gud"".The bad: Despite the popularity and this being 3rd Dark Souls game, the port is still something that should be shameful in 2016. All guide controls displayed are with controller visualizations. Not PC user friendly. Obviously the game is recommended to be played with a controller, but if you release a game on a PC, you should presume that a lot of people will be playing with a mouse & keyboard. The actual movement is better than the previous Dark Souls games, but still often feels clunky/ slippery, which is especially noticeable where where one imprecise move or unintentional slip means your death. I fell like, for a game so unforgiving, this should be the most important thing to get right. A lot of cheap feeling ""jump-scares"" that is almost like the Dark Souls trademark, but in connection with the clunky/ slipper movement, makes your character do all the wrong things like slipping off the cliff, being stuck or unable to properly evade attacks etc. Haven't seen a more annoying implementation of an online co-op version to play with your friend. Beating bosses in co-op is too easy comparing to solo. The cheaters invading player worlds and their impact on ""infecting"" innocent players with many hours with ridiculous amounts of gems or items that gets them soft-banned are countless. The lack of any direction in the maps makes you wander around the different locations sometimes for hours, trying to find the next necessary piece for advancing the story. I understand that the game is ""hardcore"" but this, in my opinion, doesn't make the playing experience better for anyone.The good: Lore and Atmosphere like no other game Diversity of bosses and their move-sets The challenge is somewhat rewarding, but, personally, most of the time I feel ""wow, I'm glad this shit-show is finally over"" and not ""omg, what an amazing boss fight this was"".",0

Enemy Projectile magnetism, this is the dumbest mechanic they give to enemies, where magic and arrows even thrown object like bombs follow the player, meanwhile if an enemy even move 1 frame to the left or right even an a Giant arrow from a GreatBow can miss.most of the time sidesteping is pointless unless you are running sideways or dodging, projectile will hit you if you just sidestep which feel like an intentional punishment to players.Enemy speed: honestly feels way to unbalanced against the player, an enemy can 1 hand a giant heavy weapon and swing it like a stick without limit at ridiculous speed, meanwhile if you do the same not only you will be swinging it with very slow-motion animation you can only swing it once or twice due to a stamina limitation.AND I DO NOT THINK THIS WAS MEANT FOR DESKTOP, they dint even bother to properly put a UI for keyboard and mouse.",0

I LITERALLY DON'T DO ANYTHING AND IT STARTS TO SPIN OR MOVE UP!- controll: sometimes the character moves the opposite way than I pressing a button.- enemies can hit you even you dodged to left or right by simply thrust in a curve- over-complicated menus and submenus- can't use ESC to go back in menus in most cases- no direct quit to desktopOne of the worst PC port ever. I don't think that anyone has tested the main game mechanics.It's one thing that the game is hard but when the game is cheating is another.After a few hours of play it is 100% sure that NO ONE cared about the camera and controlls.I WILL NOT BUY ANYTHING from this LAZY company (probably) ever.P.S.:Fanboys and ""git gud"" braindeads, don't bother.",0

Negative,"Great game for the most part, but don't go in expecting fairness like we've come to expect in Dark Souls. Remember the Drakekeeper with the big mace in Dragon Shrine in DS2? He's back, in different forms and names. Expect more things with seemingly infinite stamina and poise, on top of being apparently able to hit you through walls and damage you after the fact you rolled out of range. Half the deaths you experience in this game feels like cheap shots from From Software. They have learned nothing from the flaws of Dark Souls 2, and brought more bad from it over than what improvements it had. And that's just the PvE part of the game. Don't even get me started on how PvP is, with the poise stat apparently useless for players, as in literally turned off. Fast, pokey weapons dominate the PvP scene right now. All because poise is basically nonexistent due to poise being turned off. Poke, poke, poke, and you're dead. Not much you can do besides hope to parry. Rolling away only gets you poked in the back. Then it's back to poke spam. All fun and balanced, right? Oh, one last mention. Their anti-cheat system is a joke and even that is being generous. Victims get banned from multiplayer because they got poked by a hacker that illegitmately gives victims a TON of souls and permanently curses them. By the way, there's no appeals process to get unbanned because From Software can't be assed to listen to their Western customers and fix their system. It didn't work in DS2, it's not going to work in this game, From Software. Not a difficult thing to grasp.",0
Negative,"The game just isn't for me.After hearing all the good talk about dark souls and asking friends about which dark souls i should start with, I picked this one. I had high hopes but unfortunately weren't really met throughout my short time of playing.My first problem that came into play was that I really hated going through everything I went through to get to the place I died to again, only to die again and repeat the process. This killed my resolve to actually persevere through enemies.The second problem is that I'm but a lad and it was just too punishing for me. I'm faced in a situation with a tougher enemy. I have no clue how this enemy works so I wait for it to attack first and I roll to dodge it and try to attack, congratulations I was a FOOL and the enemy pulled back in time to pull their shield out and i slam my long sword into the shield, staggering me and getting impaled by a spear. This rookie mistake ends up with 92% of my health missing. One more mistake and problem number 1 arises again. So now I am bashing my head against a brick wall until I figure out the enemy pattern and can continue.The third problem I had is that delay between attacks and endlag make the gameplay feel really unresponsive. This is coming from me having a larger catalogue of FPS games, platformers and rhythm games, so I'm used to pressing a button and the action being done immediately and therefore in dark souls I'm immediately turned off by endlag and that delay between the button being registered and the action being done.TL:DR - The game is very slow and feels unresponsive and I am bored of doing the same thing only to gain a little knowledge about how to destroy said enemy I can't get past and dying again to do it all over again. Game is probably really good I just can't get past these hiccups. Just simply not for me.",0
Negative,"Dark, dreary, clunky and brutal. If you are a masochist, you will enjoy this game. For everyone else, there is Elden Ring.

Negative,"First off, I LOVE Dark Souls games. I love the challenge, lore, everything. But at this moment the PC version has two major bugs that I cannot forgive: the game freezes randomly and summons are unreliable.The first issue people said they've ""fixed"" with stopping system processes or updating controller/graphics drivers; I've tried it all and, while reduced, it still happens. It breaks emersion and combat cadence.The second issue is absolutely terrible. I cannot cross fog doors when summoned as a sun bro. Or I'll try summoning people and 9 out of 10 times, it fails. I've also noticed plenty of PVP glitches and lag. I have a very good gaming PC and the best broadband service in my area. My roomates and I play plenty of online competitive games with no complaints. And what's worse, when I'm the only only gaming this still happens to DS3 and other games play fine online.There's not much I can do, but shelve the game and wait for patches (no, not that guy) to roll out. What's crazy is that for all the compaints DS1 got, it played smoother and more consistently than DS3. DS2 was practically a perfect PC experience in comparison. It saddens me to say this: I cannot recommend this game in it's current state.",0
Negative,"This game is my least favorite of the series. Although I think badly about this one it holds single-handedly the strongest boss designs/fights in the entire FS lineup. Although the bosses in this game are absolutely amazing, there are some that shine through even more, especially Midir, my favorite boss of all time. The boss design is the only diamond in the rough. PvP in this game is absolutely atrocious, simply the worst in the series as there are a plethora of flaws in every aspect of it. Another massive gripe I have with this game is the world design. It's almost like they didn't even try. I have played every game countless times over and DS3 is always the worst one to run through. I understand that these are supposed to be linear to some degree, but DS3 takes it to a whole other level, coining it the nickname (from me personally) a hallway to bosses. I will defend this games bosses over any other game any day of the week but I still enjoy playing through DS2 more whether its casually or if I was speeding through the game, simply based off of the RPG elements received in DS2 that simply never made an appearance in this game. I am referencing the insane amount of weapons and armor pieces that have passive effects that gave it that tiny touch of RPG these games needed. I also wanted CoC to make a return from DS2 but for some reason that was gone. A covenant that made the game more challenging, essentially running though the game on NG+ rather than NG is amazing. Of course bonfire aesthetics were a great touch as well as fire seeds and the overall balance given to magic from DS1, obviously, excluding the overpowered item called Amber Herb. Sadly DS3 lacks heavily in these fun little gimmicks and made the game 'boring' as I like to put it. I view DS3 like the overarching community views DS2. I dislike it heavily, but I will be honest, at certain points and times, it can be extremely fun and I only ever fun through it for the bosses.",0
Negative,"Wait it out.I'll start by saying that, as far as I have played, Dark Souls 3 is the best game in the series with varied gameplay (for a Souls game) and an environment that truly pushes you to explore it. Gone is the bland map and encounter design from DSII, replaced with newer, much more varied encounters and places. The storyline seems a bit more explained this time around, and the overall feeling of the game is quite good: It speaks as a labor of love, one that deserves to be played.HOWEVER: It runs bad. For me the framerate is all over the place, jumping from 60fps down to 15 at the drop of a hat, and changing the configuration does nothing to help. The issues persist whether the game is run on minimum or max settings, with the variance adding perhaps five frames per second to the overall experience. ""Bad ports"" as the previous two games were thought to be, they ran much better than this, and therefore I can't possibly recommend that people get this game NOW, particularly when some people are getting not just framerate drops, but constant crashed (I'm luckily not one of those).Wait it out. If it gets patched and becomes properly playable without the game becoming a slideshow I'll change my review to the positive one the actual game design underneath deserves. The risk of getting it right now just isn't worth it: Souls games are meant to be played smoothly, since reflexes are needed to survive in them. When the framerate is wonky and the game threatens with crashing you just can't do that.",0

Shame on you FromSoftAs it is right now, I cannot recommend the game.Edit: after the 1.03.1 patch the game is crashing less often, and is playable now.

All of it has been sucked dry. Everyone seems to want only one thing and that is to completely halt and stall any fun or enjoyment that is to be had in this battered horse carcass of a series, and well done on them! Their efforts have been successful. I'll probably come back and try the game again when the player count has dwindled to nigh-infinitesimal numbers, and enjoy the game then.",0
Negative,"Take my review with a grain of salt since I haven't completed the game:I honestly didn't like it much. I have enjoyed DS1 and DS2 much more than this one. The uh, let's call it home base, sucks compared to the other 2 games. I had a hard time getting into the game's atmosphere and lore, and evidently from playtime, it never actually happened so far. I cleared a few areas, fought some boss and then decided to set it aside.It may well be due to burning out on this type of game? But from how I remember it, I just didn't feel the story, atmosphere and/or characters of the game as I did in its predecessors. It lacked charm to me. Generally, Dark Souls games aren't known for having a happy, relaxing atmoshere, sure~ but at the very least the 'home base' has been charming, relaxing or nice to stay at. In DS3, it's just a grey hole cave thing.Gameplaywise, I would also say that the game felt a bit too quick to me to the point that it felt off to me. This may be a positive for some - I didn't like it.That said, if all you care about is this type of game as well as not minding a faster pace than is usual for a Dark Souls game, then this game is prolly for you and you likely already bought and cleared it anyway. I simply didn't feel it this time. I may try it some time down the line, but given that I got the game in 2016, and it now being 2023 and still only having 8.4 hours to my name in this as opposed to the 200+ hours I have in DS2 for example. I don't see it happening.Edit: I just noticed the game is still at 60 bucks full price 7 years after its release. that seems like a negative in my view as to whether or not to recommend this game as well.",0
Negative,"Perhaps I do recommend it after all. Not sure. This is not an awful game, but it has a number of quirks that turns it into an unnecessarily frustrating experience. Granted, I am writing this review affected by fresh DS3 frustration, and the best games provides a certain degree of frustration, but this is too much, in my opinion.DS3 is, for better or worse, unforgiving. The gameplay is pretty good. The atmosphere is magnificent. The enemies do bore me after some time of repetition, but they can all amazingly easily kill you if you make a small mistake, which is nice. It's not the gameplay in itself that annoys the fuck out of me, though:One of the aforementioned quirks is simply that it is an obvious console port with controls not designed for the PC, but after a couple of hours, you overcome much of, if not all, these obstacles.Another is its imposing limitations. Take the co-op dimension. I'm not going to go into detail about how I bought this game because it was said to have magnificent co-op. Spoiler alert; it doesn't. Or, rather, once you finally manage to summon your friend (took me 15 hours to understand how and where it's done), who by the way can't progress his or her own campaign while being a ""phantom"" in your game, and who gets only half of their much needed health flasks, you are invaded by someone far more talented than yourself, and who knows what he's doing, and he kills you and your friend off, and you have to find another ""ember"" to be able to summon again. Now, why is this not an option? Okay, you don't want to offer good, simple co-op mechanics for those who wish it, but why not at least let casual and non-competitive players simply TURN OFF invasion? Some people say that no one plays DS3 for the co-op/pve dimension of the game, and that is wrong. So why not allow for more obvious options so that players can more easily actually play and learn the game? Perhaps I would have enjoyed this game more if it let me play it enough to learn how to play it without getting invaded as soon as I'm ""embered"". It is these unnecessary limitations that I simply can't accept.The game in a sense forces you to love it before it gives you anything back, and while I can respect the designers who obviously didn't give a fuck about casual players, it doesn't necessarily make it fun. And I play games mostly for fun.",0

Negative,"DS3 is the same miserable, trashy Bloodborne with DS1 decorations and items from the series. I didn t get fun of completing this part at all, at some point I dropped the game for more than a year, now I have found the strength to finish this masterpiece. In my opinion there are only two soul games Demon souls (hardcore and buggy) and Dark souls 1 (""Golden standard"", slightly less hardcore and less buggy). As for DS2, the game feels like a late child of Lords of the Fallen and Darksiders, a very strange feeling you experience when passing the second part of the series. It's like scratching the balls, bringing your fingers to your nose, knowing that there will be no flavor of roses, but you still do and inhale with ""rapture"".In conclusion:Bloodborn lovers can safely buy the third part and play in a classic way with a silly smile and eyes looking in different directions./DS3 , Bloodborne DS1 . , - , "" "" . , , Demon souls ( ) Dark souls 1( , ).

Negative,"Clear cookie cutter console port. No support for ultrawide, no support for more than 60 fps, no support for keyboard and mouse (implementation feels like they slapped it on 5 minutes before the release).The gameplay loop is not exactly. skill based, yet the game presents itself as a challenge. It depends on your knowledge of game mechanics that you get. through trial and error. You don't get to become better at the game. You either memorize everything and beat your enemy, or you die learning. Essentially, this is just a complex memory game where skill is not exactly involved. You see. playing a different game - you will be able to tackle challenges through experimentation and overall progression and/or skill. In this game, you are reliant on dodgy mechanics such as invincibility frames, inconsistent AI behavior that is sort of the same every time you die, except every now and then enemies will act in an entirely different way, making you just die for no reason. When enemies wear shields, it doesn't take away from their stamina and they don't need to block for the shield to block your attacks. When they swing near terrain, they don't get stunned by hitting a wall with their sword. But when you have a shield equipped, you HAVE to block, otherwise enemy attacks go right through your shield, despite them attacking you from your shield side. Have an enemy near terrain? Tough luck because you will swing, hit them and then your blade will hit the wall next to them, you will get stunned and the game will punish you for this. Its just overall inconsistencies of game mechanics that apply to the player, but not the mobs is what is frustrating. The enemies do not have stamina - they have infinite amounts of stamina. They have pre-determined attack sets which have openings for you to attack them, although the timeframe between these attack sets is. inconsistent. Sometimes the enemy will sit there and look at you for a solid 10 seconds, other times, they will perform three attack sets with literally no time inbetween for you to attack, making you think that ""hey, you learned his attacks and you are using that to your advantage"" except not really because it is inconsistent. Sure, you can wait more and more before you strike, but this makes the game even more unskilled as a result, as you can't really be sure what the enemy will do, you just have to wait, which is tedious and unfun. Also. the fact that they can initiate attack sets one after another without stopping means that the mobs have the power to overcome you (which is the idea of the game, fighting enemies muuuch stronger than you are, but you outwitting them), except they just straight up decide to not use all of their power against you, thus letting you defeat them. Like, what? Why make a game all about difficulty and design the lore around the enemies being strong and then code it in a way to have them just not use their full power? That is a bit counter intuitive. They had an idea and then half-way through implementing it they were like ""nah, lets go the opposite direction of that idea"". A fix for that would be to give enemies actual limits - like not being able to block indefinitely and not have infinite stamina, which would actually make a lot of sense and will lead to a more predictable and consistent behavior and this would make it more skillful, but oh well.Sure. The game presents a challenge to overcome and a hard one.Winning a game of basketball versus an NBA team is a challenge.Watching paint dry for 2 days straight without letting your vision stray away and not eating at all is a challenge.One requires huge amounts of skill and physique, the other requires extreme patience. If you expect a challenge that would be closer to the first example - this is not the game for you, as the *type* of challenge that this game presents in my eyes is one similar to that of the second example.",0
Negative,"It's like doing chores. Repetitive, ultimately pointless, and when you finish your only solace is the thought, ""oh! now I can do it again, but correctly!""

If you have an xBox Controller then fine, the game won't be an issue, but if not (like me) it's no worth it. Menus are awkward, hints are borderline useless to start with as the controls are given for an xbox controller, the gameplay is clunkly as hell when you have learned the controls by guessing.

Negative,"May as well start the review with the cards on the table, that is the 600 and some odd hours I spent in DS2. More importantly, I wrote a lengthy negative review for DS2 and continued to be drawn towards the game, amassing those hours. Like many fans of the series I missed out on DS1 due to bad port, but I enjoyed the pants off Demon Souls. This one didn't go so well with me and I guess I'd like to explain why below, if your interested. Making no effort to hide any spoilers.We kick right off the game rolling into the first boss which probably caused a heap of refunds for those that didn't spend those few important test-hours in character creation. Really not sure what the idea was with this boss, but it was not the right choice for boss number one. This boss returns near the end of the game once again to show you how having loads of stamina and a very fast weapon is the only way for success in Dark Souls 3 boss fights. And it also shows how bad animations and glitchy enemy-arm-must-autolock-player-model-no-matter-what-way-he-is-facing looks like on the screen. And eww, nowhere in this review will I be saying anything about difficulty, same went for that DS2 review. (prefer the word frustration)The odd mechanics continue forward with the same layers that I must be frankly tired of by now. Entire zones with poison effects, stunlock situations abound, zones with auto-targetting projectiles raining from the sky on the other end of the map, enemies seemingly without stamina bars and unlimited magics/projectiles, enemies full capability to strike through walls and objects (the ai makes full attempts to use this feature). For comparison, the character you play has trouble wielding a sword in a hallway as swinging it bounces wildy off the walls. Best advice for a new player of this game, don't think for a second that the enemies play by the same game world rules as you do. Some of this I expected to be the same from DS2 and it was, so I shouldn't have the right to complain.Probably the biggest no-no for me is this fast-forward feel to the game. I read this is some kind of Bloodborne feature but never played that game. Pushing the fast forward button on Dark Souls after releasing three prior games in the souls series with slow-methodical gameplay, why? Say hello to the horrible camera controls, now in high speed. Watch as high-speed bosses flip around arenas causing the camera to lose its mind. (sigh).nevermind your dead again.I don't know what happened. All I can say is I have zero interest in entering new game plus mode. (which has been a staple feature in the series) For new players, you can re-enter the game in new game plus mode with your character beefed up and play through a harder version. But with the flashbacks of the bosses, the camera, the who-made-these-decisions face palms?Armor no longer can be upgraded which is great, as there wasn't enough materials in the game to do it anyway. Unfortunately it seems armor-with-buffs doesn't really exist anymore. (just one or two items) Dual wielding weapons seems to be removed, which is a shame it was fun to dual wield ultra great swords in DS2. (or hammers, or morning stars.etc) Archery has been nerfed big time with arrow stacks at 99 arrows instead of 999. 99 arrows doesn't get you to the next bonfire unless you run pass everything, and running pass enemies doesn't earn souls to buy more arrows. Just started using magic after finishing the game, so not going to comment on fighting bosses solo with it. All I can say is you have to use fast weapons in the boss arenas, and have lots of stamina to survive. (see fast-forwarded gameplay above)There's more but I must be about out of room by now. Thanks for reading and hopefully this was helpful to some extent.

Negative,Have some self respect.,0
Negative,"Dark Souls 3 for me is the weakest game in the entire From Software series. It's a massive step down for last years GOTY Bloodborne and it's expansion The Old Hunters in every way possible. Some areas borrow Bloodbornes enemy mechanics but it fails to balance the odds. Classes are severely weakened(forget about playing mage or pyromancer). You are required to use frustrating melee brute force. Armor upgrading is removed and the newly introduced weapon arts gimmick is clunky, leaves you extremely vulnerable and slows you down even more, if you use it, you better make sure it hits it's target or prepare for a spamming stunlock death. When considering the games enemy pace has been increased greatly. It's for PVP only.It is a frustrating slog in the later areas after a easy opening half. This game lures you in with it's easy opening and then later pummels you unfairly while exposing it's balancing issues later in the game. Frenzied fast bosses without Bloodbornes player dash? It's just plain silly, it's Broken! You will be summoning players regularly, if you can actually summon them. Online is a little janky at times. Connection and animation issues.Artisically it's also the most visually unimpressive entry. Bloodborne looks so much better. It has the modern graphical bells and whistles but it doesn't have the beauty of DS1's Anor Londo or Majula of DSII. Irithyll of the Boreal Valley is the games visual highlight. Instead It has a look that fits in with the death and decay conclusion to the series. Level design is also lacking. levels are large but a little simplistic and look rushed in places.If you are a souls fan you already own it. If not, wait for the eventual Steam sale.With a heavy heart I'm leaving a negative review. The series can and has done so much better before.",0

Negative,"This game is pretty bad, pretty bad.""omg y u say dis myazaki maed dis gaem, he es mah gawd"", yes yes i know, you are just a stupid fanboy willing to eat whatever myazaki makes.Dark Souls 3 had potential, it could've easily been the best souls game, it could've beaten DKS2 in PvP and DKS1 in PvE.Okay lets get to the pros and consPROS: Good PvE.Great map design.Great combat system.Has PvP.Well designed bosses.Difficult.CONS: Magic is WORTHLESS, unless you are going sorcery (with CSS or CSM), but then again, everyone in PvP can dodge it.No replayability.Melee is overpowered, it is way better than magic.Can't go hybrid magic/melee, you have to invest 50 int/faith to do serious damage.Tank builds are non-exsistant, they have low def and poise is bad (hyperarmor on attacks).PvP is insanely inbalanced, its either use a long-ranged ultra weapon or use the washing pole, fist weapons are USELESS USELESS USELESS USELESS! (or any short ranged weapon in this game) No versatility in weapons, they all have the same movesets and there are only about 6 weapons that are worth using in pvp.Rolling is too spammy, in other souls games, the more weight you put on the worse your roll gets, there was a ninja flip (op) light roll, medium roll and fat roll, now its just light roll and fat roll. Equip the Carthus Bloodring as well and you can't be touched at all.Invasions are so bad in this game, the game puts you at a GIANT disadvantage, prepare yourselves, this is going to be a long list of disadvantages1. When you invade, you will have less hp than the host.2. The host can summon 3 people into his world without cooldown (if you kill one, he can just summon another)3. You have HALF your healing/mana items, meaning magic is even more useless and invasions are even more hard.4. When you die in an invasion, instead of your souls being place where you used the Red Eye Orb, it will be put where you died so you must either run all the way to where your souls are, fighting through mobs and wasting your time. Or you can just lose your souls and start another.""Oh but you have mobs to assist you, meaning you have a great advantage"", yes true, but this brings us to ANOTHER disadvantage6. The host can turn his mobs against you with the seed of the giant tree.Really fromsoft? so not only am i getting destroyed by 3 phantoms and 1 host with meta weapons, but i have less healing items, their mobs piling up on me and ripping me to shreds, AND my souls get placed like a million metres away. It is so inconvienient and unrewarding to invade someones world.That is UNLESS, you make a meta build consisting of the lothric knight greatsword (does stupid damage), Moron blade (20% more damage with low hp), Red Tearstone Ring (20% MORE damage with low hp), and boom, you are now one-shotting people.That gets super boring, using one build over and over again just to be able to do something in invasions. If you want PvP, I suggest placing a Red Soapstone Sign down, so you can be summoned for a duel and have an actual fair fight.Oh yeah, and i forgot to tell you, you can't get invaded if you kill the boss of the area. Wow, you didnt learn from DKS1, instead you made it so people can only get invaded like 4 times in the entire game (you have to be lucky to get invaded 4 times).Like I said, this game could've been great, but they screwed up PvP and made it so you can only go light armor with heavy weapon/dex weapon or you do nothing.I give this game a 5/10, I will change this review after dlc comes out, hopefully then the game is more balanced, right now, I just cant recommend this game.inb4 people who cant be bothered to read the review and dislikes straight away.",0

See, I like that the game is meant to be hard, but at least give me the option to be able to dodge things properly. And here is what my issue is: rolling. It's bonkers. There is like a half second delay from the time I tell the game to roll and when it actually does it. This is also a problem with attacks to an extent, but it's especially bad when rolling. If I tell you to roll, ROLL. Like NOW! Everything in this game as a delayed response and that's frankly BS.Not getting another Dark Souls game ever again.

Bad animations, clunky repetitive combat, ugly 3d models, shallow story trying to be ""deep"" by reducing accesibility, exploitative gameplay, meaningless progression, and a general sense of ""half-bakedness"" across the board. The only things I like are the environment and design of creatures. The success of the series depends entirely on fanboys convincing each other ""Oh you play Dark Souls? You hardcore!""",0
Negative,"THIS IS NOT DARK SOULS!Dark souls is know for being hard but fair. I can't count how many cheap deaths I had in this game. Like having full health then knocked to the ground and before I can even get up im hit so many times I die. Or getting wedged inbetween objects in the game and not being able to move so the enemies just kill you. Or the fact they can hit you through solid objects like trees and walls! CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP.I love the Souls games I have hundreds of hours in them, I love playing them over and over. This.this I am not enjoying. GraphicsNot great. I would even say not next gen.Some areas just look really bad. Almost as if the game was rushed. Framerate issuesSoundGood. Not much to screw up in these games though.GameplayEnemie AI is broken at times.Relentless mobs that dont stop attacking so your stamina is drained until they kill you.Casting magic takes to long compared to the speed of the enemies. Using a sheild to block is death because relentless attacks.(the game forces you to play one way. Attack then roll away. repeat. They should have called it Dark Rolls)There is so much I can say about this game but I am just too disapointed to even bother. Oh yeah and I wont talk about the crashes.",0
Negative,"Kinda shit level design, bosses are kinda shit, and the game is riddled with hackers that can permanently ruin your save meaning a ban or losing all your progress. Pretty much every invader cheats since ""Honest Merchant"" mod came out, and if you somehow manage to defeat an invader using this mod, or even more op mods like statchecker etc, you will probably instantly die from the invaders ""smite"" cheat, which does 1000 lightning damage a second and breaks all equipment, and if you are lucky you might even recieve an item which bans your character. Dont play online, if you do, use anticheat mods and hacks to hopefully avoid most cheaters, or get banned yorself since there are less cheaters on the banned servers.",0
Negative,"Like all Dark Souls games, this is a terrible attempt at porting to the PC. I really don't recommend it.",0
Negative,Please fix the online service. Don't abandon this game FromSoftware !,0
Negative,really fun game,0
Negative,"They went absolutely insane with the regional pricing. I paid around R$30 for the Deluxe Edition, now the game is going for R$115 for JUST THE BASE GAME. The Deluxe Edition is now over 160. That's over a 5x increase in price.",0
Negative,"It's more of a mixed recommendation, it depends on what you are looking for when you sit down to game. If you like working on very hard problems, grinding away at it bit by bit, then this game is for you. For me however, this game feels like hard work, and after I do my actual job I like to relax and have fun with games.It's not that I am against a good challenge, I really liked Elden Ring. Here though it feels like the game prioritizes difficulty over fun. Every boss door has a few tough enemies in front of it that you kill over and over again as you learn the boss. Not sure why, just to spite you I guess. Sometimes you have to backtrack the map and the fast travel points are not even close to were the game is branching off, so it can be confusing where to go.Of course it's very satisfying to overcome bosses in this game, but everything else in the game is overly annoying in my opinion. In contrast Elden Ring was a joy to explore.",0
Negative,Why in the hell is this still $60? It's damn near 3 years old. Thought I'd pick it up for PC but guess not. The other versions you can get for like $5.,0

Negative,"This game is ass just because of the fcking door bug at the Dancer of the Boreal Valley boss fight. L game, Elden Ring is better.",0
Negative,"It require too much effort to play and gives nothing back. If you don't want to spend 100+ hours trying to understand how to beat delay on the controls first, camera glitches second and ass-kicking bosses (especially one of them that without knowing what to do will take probably a week of your time) then better avoid this game. Game gives you only minimum amount of information even if you pay attention to every dialog, it doesn't provide you clear vision on what to do next and even where exactly you are in current moment (because there is no map). Graphics are beautiful, story line is intriguing but not full clear, especially if you play it in non-native English.",0
Negative,"The pacing of combat makes no sense for the first boss and for almost all other hostile people. I got stuck on a spear knight blocking my way and couldn't hit him unless I was lucky because there isn't any gaps in his move set unless you roll out of the way. BUT even if you roll out of the way your small survival frame will most likely wear off and his spear will be somewhere where you will touch it get damaged, staggered, stabbed, then killed. Another issue is that I spent 5 to 10 minutes trying to change one key binding because they couldn't bother to even port this game over to PC from xbox properly. Overall I'm displeased because Dark Souls was one of my more favorite games, I would go back to one on the 360 all the time. This just can't compare though.",0
Negative,Cant play the game lol,0
Negative,Great game but joke of an anti-cheat system.Do NOT buy this until they fix their anti-cheat system or you'll risk losing online play for no reason with no support or a word from the developers even if you follow all instructions.,0
Negative,"I am so glad I finally picked up this game to play it. I really missed out on a whole genre of games that I thought I would never be interested in. I absolutely love the Dark Souls and 'Souls like' franchise, but.Out of spite i'll still say that it's unacceptable that a PC port of a game does not include simple features such as -Mappable Controls -Mouse and Keyboard support (i.e. showing what keybinds does what etc)-Proper Graphic settings (Being able to change things more than just textures and motion blur-Half-assed controller support, only Xbox support. Meaning that when I plug in a PS4 controller, I have to know the keybinds by heart in order to even play the game correctly. (This is a horrible idea because this was my first souls game, I had to go out of my way just to play with a old controller just to sit through countless troubleshooting videos because Xbox 360 controllers are not bluetooth and require a external wireless adapter.)All of these problems stated are issues that I had to never experience in most PC games and ports because they are made in mind of the user and platform. This is unacceptable and shows a lack of care from the developers for their game. And to drive this point further because most fanboys I'll talk to about this issue always get so flustered, let me make a point so you can understand the principle of the issue at hand.Imagine buying a game from a company like Nintendo or Sony. You are buying a game for that platform (Switch or PS4) and without any note from the developers or from the company that you are buying from fails to mention that it has basic features missing. You put the disc into your console and you realize that it barley works with the controller that you use to play 99.9% of your games with. You do some troubleshooting and you find out it only has true Mouse and Keyboard support. And using a controller is borderline useless unless you want to mod it in so it can work properly. Well that's a little ridiculous, especially that you are playing on a console and usually you are not asked to use such a input mode before. My point here is that you are being forced to use a medium of input that is alien to the hardware you are using, just because the lazy developers did not spend the extra time to make a simple addition to support the platform's main input and control scheme. If the developers fail to make a simple addition in preparation of the platform the game will be released on, it shows a lack of care for their own game.",0
Negative,"Thank you bandai namco, remove the game from geforce now so that people who bought for that platform cant play. Never ever buying a game from you.",0
Negative,"no, just no",0
Negative,"If you're just looking for more of the same Dark Souls single player experience, I'd recommend the game. A lot more of the unique world, lore and bosses are packed into this one, though at this point in the series a lot of the bosses are getting a little too easy and predictable.If you're wanting anything innovative or remotely different, look elsewhere. Almost nothing new is brought to the table.If you're looking for a fun and complex PvP scene, as I was myself, turn the other way. A large amount of the skill and strategy involved in PvP has been gutted from the game, replaced with gimmicky weapon arts and bugs where your enemies will have literally zero animations. The netcode is worse than ever and there's no dedicated PvP arena, something that they'll probably add in future DLC. Everything is obviously horribly balanced, backsteps rarely work, you can't fake attack, healing isn't punishable. There's a lot to be fixed and some that can't.",0
Negative,"Don't get me wrong, I love me some Dark Souls. However,Best Crashing Simulator 2016Fromsoft please patch the game",0

Negative,"Only shows xbox controller buttons. Mouse sensitivity is off the charts, I turned in game mouse sens down to 1, and camera speed down to 1, my camera still flying all over the place had to turn down my dpi but then when I do that my mouse is super slow when I hit escape to go into the menu. So dumb that studios just port a game without any effort whatsoever. Background sound effects keep cutting out every 5 seconds which is super annoying. Would love to play the actual game but unfortunately because the developer is lazy and doesn't care about PC this is not it.",0
Negative,"I know, I know, I'm a bad gamer. I wanted to like Dark Souls, I really did, but as my first foray into the Souls-series, it didn't do the trick. The weapons feel sluggish, and I can't properly control my character half the time. It's not even too challenging, I just find the controls actually obnoxious, and with my bad sense of orientation, I spent my entire time on the walls of lothric not finding where I need to go to continue.I really wanted to like this game, but I just couldn't quite manage.",0
Negative,"PVE is fine. PVP is shit.Expecting a fun PVP game ? Well dont. Invading has a plethora of problems and to top it off, cross region matchmaking is never not on and youll just get a bunch of laggy chinese retards hacking using family share accounts.",0
Negative,"This game is currently completely unplayable due to constant crashes and disconnecting from the server due to insufficient frame rate(On minimum settings with a decent computer, never had any issues running any other new game on maximum settings) and getting booted back to the main menu, where it will crash again sometimes, and it will crash when starting the game back up after it crashed, horrible port, no effort at all and 1 month behind the console release? Don't buy this unless they fix these issues, in fact, get your money back while you can if you have purchased it already, and buy it later once you can actually play it, it'll probably be cheaper.",0
Negative,after a couple 100 hours on console and pc cobined i say dark souls 3 is the worst of the 3/4 if you count elden ring map design of dark souls 3 was pretty damn lazy and waay too linear and felt too much like fan service with bringing back a part of anor londo enemy design pretty lazy aswell as it's just reskinned dark souls 1 and bloodborne enemies bosses are also worse in my opinion like over half of them feel like bloodborne enemies by how fast they attack making me think damn wish i had that parry pistol in dark souls 1 all these enemies where pretty slow except from the dlc but that was logical with the size of some of them when i saw vordt i was like oh is he like asylum demon aka slow and fat but no not slow just fat as if they thought the game would be more fun and hard when every enemie is attacking and moving double your speed,0
Negative,"This is a lazy port from console without any PC optimization. Tooltips only show controls for controllers and there is no option to change this to KB+M controls. I don't even have a controller. This makes no sense. I have to constantly go back and forth between my keybinds settings just to see what key does what. More frustrating than it is worth. It is even locked to 60 FPS! As if this were still on a console! Gross. I really wanted to like this game and be able to enjoy it, but it just wasn't made for PC at all. Requested a refund after finding no way to change tooltips to show KB+M controls instead of controller.",0

Negative,"Unfairly get overleveled people joining in the game for beginners and not letting them actually play the game and if a dark spirit does join your game and you are starting to beat it, it will continue to just retreat until the cpu kills you. dark spirits ruin this game and for that reason would not recommend it to anyone.",0
Negative,"+1year after release consider this the final patched version.PVP is very disappointing and frustrating with broken hitboxes, laggy matchmaking (or netcode ?) and overall unsatisfying fight dynamic.NPC quests, (inexistent)-storytelling and lore presentation really don't do it for me.PVE and map design is bland and non innovative. Most bosses are forgettable.Faster gameplay is a step in the right direction but it feels like a circus at times, Bloodborne did it better.Unfinished and/or rushed ? Where are previous improvements from Dark Souls 2 ?I still have a sour taste from the Dark Souls 2 Scholar of the first sin rerelease and this last adventure doesn't end with a glorious note. No interest for DLC.-PVP- Focused on 1v1, invasionsLongswords hit 1m away from their tip, lance charges have a 2m radius despite the animation, phantom hits through evasion rolls, 180 degrees correction turns ala ballerina (non commiting start animation).Poise system is ineffective (balance stat granted by armor) so a walking mountain ends up being staggered by a plastic butter knife 3 meters away thanks to cross-continental lag. You often trade direct blows despite having a clearly faster windup or longer range. There is also a hyperarmor granted upon swinging certain heavy weapons which grants stagger immunity however this starts too early in the swinging animation e.g. R1 > first horizontal swing ends > R1 > opponent fails to stagger you whilst you're not even in a swinging animation (sword is still held to the side) due to R1 prefire. 2 light attacks should chain into each other but lag sets them free at times ending up in a trade.Parries do not make for an interesting/fun fight or mechanic, certain movesets are so telegraphed (limited melee mixups) you might as well stop there once you see a buckler rise up. With this well established lag I refuse to believe parrying is a worhful tactic in PVP.Class balance relies mostly on offensive tools thus magic or weapons. Most spells are telegraphed once again but maybe you could catch a lucky lag rollback into your AoE. Hyperarmor heavy weapons and overreaching longswords/estoc are clearly superior, lagwarrior trumping all. I used a scythe which wasn't high tier.Too much stamina regen and too many rolls making matches often devolve into a circus poke and run (if you're not abusing hyperarmor). Fighting games rounds usually finish under 45sec and are a lot more action packed.Matchmaking balance is also lacking as you'll encounter during your early adventure many geared-up opponents with end-game accessories. Or hackers corrupting your save ! This matchmaking cannot be taken seriously when Western Europe is being matched against China/Taiwan/South Africa, even at EU prime time and correct networking options (which don't appear to achieve anything).PVP activities seem unfinised with 2 covenants (guilds) being the same in practice : Darkmoon and Blue Sentinels. They also both struggle to get any action it turns out (which DS2 handled better). No big innovations with the others. Arena _locked_ to a DLC !Coming from fighting games this PVP community doesn't feel welcoming. Lot of snarky behavior (hatemail, salt miners, griefing, tryhards) and a ever weird cult of memes and antics. I'll never get those emotes.Overall gameplay quality really feels unrefined due to the points above. If you like 1v1 technical dueling see fighting games, if you like small group brawling see MMORPG Dota or what have you. Dark Souls weapon dynamic really isn't that interesting. For example fighting games have :- clear and consistent data, rules and animations/hitboxes = when I do this action this _should_ happen everytime- low inputlag and hopefully better regional/rank matchmaking- technical with pressure, mixups, low/overhead, jumping, grabs, oki, reactions, meters, reversal and combos- fast dynamic and fluid- mostly balanced and no gear/build time waste- fighting space management (additional pressure once cornered)- easier on the eyes, an arena focuses on the fighters with clear animations / chara design (it's hard to identify dark souls weapons at times)- no silly mile staring contest whilst jiggling around, 9 consecutive circus rolls or improvised marathon. There is always a reaction button to press for pressure/punish- no roleplay no gimmicks, just people punching each other to death as it should be-NPC, story and lore- SPOILERSI hate Dark Souls 3 friendly NPC with a burning passion. Their quests are hidden, nonsensical or cryptic which means you'll most likely have to play with the wiki on your lap. Many annoying branches or death ends with one benign action messing up a whole quest progression. And their voice lines. Heheeeee, hahahaaaa, siiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiight at every dialogue end. Their mysterious faked relevance feels so forced.See the Catarina knight for example (which you meet at Undead Settlement), you end up tricked in the Cathedral by Patches wearing a Catarina armor and somehow have to guess he stole it from the knight now trapped in a well you're very likely to never pass again ? This ain't a unique armor why would have I made the connection ?Or Sirris which hates me for taking Rosaria's fingers. You couldn't deduct it from her previous dialogue at all.Only cool guy is Greirat and he ended up killed, thank you From Software.First time I met Emma the old lady guarding Lothric Castle I sliced her open in frustration before the end of her lines. This is the first NPC alluding to the story and she ends up pulling a banner out of her bottom for an inexistent and unexplained plot. That's all she is just a banner butt-puller, MMORPG Fedex quest throwbacks anyone ? Some swear by this storytelling or lack thereof, I think it's lazy. A MMORPG has more of a story and NPC development. Dark Souls 1 sitting knight at the shrine at least gave you some useful indications.External forums lorefagging is not a valid form of storytelling (neither for mechanics explanation ! see poise). Sparsed hints (willfully left cryptic so up to open interpretation) aren't either.-PVE- SPOILERSMuddy swamp, catacombs and generic skeletons, fire hell, cathedral, they really didn't look far for innovation.Some segments really made me scratch my head : first part from Road of Sacrifices with the Corvian felt off for example.Lothric castle looks good I suppose. Graphics and lighting feel nice.Seeing most of the map is a welcome return from the first game.Most bosses are forgettable. Yhorm is the worst boss fight I've ever experienced making me question if it was designed by totally unrelated developpers, it's supposed to be one of the 4 capital bosses dammit ! Abyss watchers is laughably weak to stagger so keep your table spoon at hand ! Deacons of the Deep and Skeleton Lord Wulnir are trash mob worthy, Should you meet oversized or hyperactive monsters it's the awful camera (5th game still not right) you'll fight instead.Lothric Princes were frustrating due to teleportation (causes loss of camera tracking, can end up behind you so off screen) into bright flash covering up the followup animation. It's a fun fight otherwise.I wished they explored some new modes or PVE covenants, a boss rush could have been fun.I'll be honest Dark Souls 3 left me quite bitter, playing with a blood dagger staggering everything whilst iframe drifting felt ridiculous. Previously mentionned sections didn't help. Lord of the Cinder probably saved the experience as he is the best boss fight (or one of) I've ever encountered. A boss made up of all players with all fighting styles, aggresive fast and opportunistic AI (I swear that guy surprised me with his onpoint Oki, miracle force or lance circling swings). Clear and well made patterns. Sound design and arena were great. I catched some funny pop offs when he got my character down, showing off his mighty blows to the cameraman (double miracle force for example).",0
Negative,"The game is a pale imitation of what the original aspirations sought to achieve.-PVP is unbalanced-Summoning system is unable to allow you to summon more than one person when using a password system-Summoning results in the entire animation and frames of the enemy to disappear, leaving you with stationary enemies moving without running, taking damage without attack animations, and worse.-Armor system is a new one, leaving you to suffer no matter what you equip-Poise has been disabled from the game, and any attempts to find a way to turn it back on gets you banned despite the fact you're SUPPOSED to have it. It shows poise in the status screen, and yet you have NONE of that rating at all-Camera system is shoddy to say the least; often entrapping you in a position where it cannot even maintain the lock on of a target, leaving your camera to snap forward. This usually leaves you completely unaware of your enemies next attack, and it happens frequently with bosses. -Camera distance is short and unable to maintain lockon even when target is ahead of you.All in all, I feel as though I really want a refund on this game. It's a true disgrace to have to sit here and endure the amount of bull that this company has shoveled together and slapped a Dark Souls title to. The game can't be enjoyed with friends because of the summoning issues, and holds no regard for the players at all whom have purchased this game. All in all.AVOID THIS SERIESAVOID FROM SOFTWAREGo play Salt & Sanctuary instead.",0
Negative,"As a long time souls fan this is a matter of personal opinion. This game does not come close to demon souls, DS1 or DS2 despite it being very massive and polished.

Everyone knows Dark Souls is a difficult game, and it is, and it may not only harm you and your future, but it can also lead to insanity, which is weird since I was going insane while playing it, but I am now sane and will be back playing it in a short time, and I am in love with Isabela Madrigal!",0
Negative,"Love the game, but it could have been much better. I am probably not going to finish the game because it is too hard to have such a worthless control mechanic. This was made for people with joysticks. Combat is a timing and memorization challenge where all you do is fire different animations off and then wait for them to finish. The targeting is so consoly it's gross, but it's required. you can't circle strafe around an opponent without toggle targeting. you can't look left while running right with out fighting the camera. Did they not know we have the mouse to control with? So frustrating. This game is you VS your stamina in many ways; im more worried about my stamina and which enemies need more of it and not the actual enemies. Sure I recommend this to a point, because it's quite different and will bring emotions out of you. But I also conclude that this should have never come to the master race without adjusting the game for the extreme control authority that computers have over consoles. Devs got lazy or ran out of time. I am a disappointed PC user. Console control schemes ruin the highly reactive potential of the PC.",0
Negative,"When it was released this game was so good and the DLCs only improved it and I would have recommended it in a heartbeat, but now 2 years after the last DLCs release date it is just cancer to play online.Just for good measure and so nobody gets the wrong idea, I will mention, that I am not softbanned from the game so I am not in the restricted online pool of cheaters but regardless. I just recently re-installed the game to try to get back at it after doing a Dark Souls 2 playthrough, and the experience is definitely worse than ever now.I can't invade or get invaded, at any given level bracket without meeting twinked out invaders with max estus and all items in the game, twinked out gank squads, over leveled password phantom summons chucking high level spells, like they were prism stones, that oneshot me or script kiddies that have turned god mode on. Or simply overleveled phantoms oneshotting me with their overleved weapons. To top it all off they also have very large health pools it would be impossible to kill them first with my low damage output. All that was just a small bit of what I experienced between level 18 - 30 while trying to start leonhard's quest, and it seems like it all goes completely unmonitored by from, it seems like they dont care now that Dks3 is a done and shut deal. I met more of what i just described than I met lone hosts or hosts with level appropriate phantoms.it is decent for a single player run through offline, but unless you want ""uninterrupted co-op with all my overleveled friends"" online is now a nightmare.",0
Negative,"I would love to leave a review that praises how good this game is, but the truth is that i have not had the opportunity to experience this game in the fashion that i wanted. I bought this game for one reason only - to be able to play it in coop. Having got to the point where it is possible to summon anyone into your game, i have since spent around 3 and a half hours trying and failing to bring anyone into my game. I'm sure there are plenty of people out there who might think they know some reason why it wouldn't work for me. make sure your character is 'embered', make sure you haven't killed the boss, check your firewalls, open ports on your router. etc, etc. believe me, i have tried every fix that can be googled. At this stage, i really doesn't matter to me if it is a problem with my computer or my ISP or my router - if i have to spend hours trying to make coop work with my generic PC setup and STILL fail, then this game is fundamentally broken. Many might disagree with me, but as far as i am concerned i paid money for a certain experience that was promised to me, and the creators of this game failed to make good on that promise. And the worst thing is, i cant even get my money back.So no, i cannot in good faith recommend this game, despite its amazing visuals, interesting lore and satisfying game-play, because i cannot guarantee that you won't be buying this game for the same reason i was.",0

Negative,The co op in this game is so dumb. It is such a chore just to get into the same game and progress together. If you are going to play this treat it as a solo only game. I bought this because i saw that it had co op and wanted something to play with my friend. I like hard games in general i enjoy the game but they make it such a choir to play with a friend. The system doesnt even make the game harder it just makes it more inconvient and annoying.,0
Negative,"Absolutely terrible creators who successfully destroyed this game for me and showed that in effect it's a waste of money.First of all, I play co-op with my friend. Which means that other than jumping through 1,000 hoops to make yourself uninvadeable it's just not possible to co-op this game really. So, right from the start 30 seconds after we find each other in game we're invaded by someone who literally can't die. For over 20 minutes we were fighting the person whom took ZERO damage from us until we finally died.10 minutes later, yet another invasion from someone wearing what we later discovered to be ""end game"" armour, who had unlimited amounts of estus flasks. About an hour later, we're invaded by someone who seems to drop a bunch of weapons and items but we actually managed to kill him, I picked up a few items and we continued the game, finally we got the blue shield thingy that helps us when we're invaded, however being invaded every 15-20 minutes of gameplay is complete breaking the game. How are you meant to make any form of progression when you're constantly invaded by hackers/cheaters?So, like a week later I was given a warning that my ""save file is corrupted"". I googled a whole bunch to find that the items the guy dropped must be duped or something. Oh but wait, it's not over. After I DELETED my damn character due to their garbage cheat detection, 4 days later I got banned ANYWAY regardless of the fact I've never cheated in the game.So let's get this straight, your restrictions now prevent me and my friend playing together, you place me against people you KNOW hack, and now I'm left with a 60 on the deluxe edition of the game that I'm never going to play again because your trash system thinks I'm a cheater?Good game, unfortunately the creators are just complete trash and don't know how to detect ACTUAL cheaters.",0

Negative,"I'm suprised I've never written a review for DS3 well, Here it goesWhere do I begin. Starting off Yes I have 145 hours on record by the time im writing this which probably means I love the game right?Well. Thats not the truth at all, I want to love this game. Especially as a long time fan of the Souls franchise and anything From Soft.Lets begin with the Pros.The Pros to Dark Souls 3:- The Combat has been improved upon even more then its previous two games - The Coop has become more fluent and so has the PVP aspect of it- Theres more Spells then in the Previous games and a Introduction of a new spell type in each of the three trees aswell as bringing back old fan favorite spells such as power within.- Lots of hints and reference to the previous two installments especially Dark Souls 1- Not every weapon is the same introducing unique skills and movesetBut thats all I can say now about the Cons.- While yes I just praised the Coop and the PVP aspect its also its biggest downfall, due to allowing way more players into each world theres alot of times where Players just decide to Gang on single random invaders or if youre unlucky you get a group invading you(Yes even blue boys could fuck you over) - Pyromancy. My god. I started as a pyro player because I was like yknow what lets try something different. and oh boy. Was it a big mistake. It made the whole game a cakewalk and actually kind of a shame. It feels like spells are super overpowerd in this iteration.- Endings, When the game first came out it was so messy that when I was heading for one ending I suddenly got another one because it bugged out and didnt let me get the thing I was actually aiming for this apperently took a longtime to fix even after I finished playing- Bosses as stated above with the pyromancy I feel like the difficulty felt much less challenging then the previous game (Talking about the base game here not the dlcs)- The dlcs. They were great but. I feel like they were on crack when designing some of these dlc bosses I loved them dont get me wrong it was great fighting and getting my ass handed but some of it also felt like bullshit and poor frames or hitboxes (God we love our crappyy souls hitboxes dont we?)- Now this one. as a long time player I used to LOVE arenas in both dark souls 1 and 2 but. MAN in dark souls 3. the fact that both the local hosted arena and the most popular pvp area was on the same map. really ruined the PVP for me for mentioned up above if you didnt find natural players you would usually end up in a arena against your willNow for my actual end of this wall of review. Dark Souls 3 is a great game dont get me wrong but I dont think its for the hardcore dark souls 1 lovers (And 2 if some of you exist LOL) This is more for the People that has never played a Dark souls before and want to get into it without getting kicked hard like we used to in the Original (I really felt that getting kicked hard again in the remaster of 1)Now if you have been considering picking it up for a long time If you are new to the franchise definitly start with this one to ease into it but if youre a vet and never picked up 3 Im unsure if you would enjoy it because it may be easier then the previous installments but ultimately.Make your own Opinion and dont just blindly trust what someone writes on the Internet.",0
Negative,"* PvP review * Dark Souls 3 pvp is extremely unbalanced and highly flawed (unlike singleplayer, which is fun and well designed), the lack of poise is laughable, making short spammy weapons all the more annoying. Hyper armor on greatweapons is insane, the high damage plus the ability to auto-poise through any attack is just down right overpowered. There are obvious weapons in the game that are by default stronger than others, giving you an immediate disadvantage for using anything else. Invasions are bad, really bad. When invading, you're going to be put against at least 2 enemies by default due to new gameplay changes in DS3. Every invasion is a gank, and it's painful. Invaders get half of the estus that the host gets, and by itself its not a bad idea, but when you combine that with the 2v1 or 3v1 scenario for invasions its just not enjoyable. Estus was annoying in DS2 sure, but it's not nearly as bad as DS3's new estus mechanic. Estus chugging is super fucking quick, and can be abused in pvp. If your opponent is just a bit more than a swords reach away he can heal instantly back up to full health, thew animation for healing is much much quicker than in DS2. It generally ruins invasions, but it's not as big of an issue in fight clubs, as most people use the honor system. It just adds to the already flawed pvp experience in DS3I'm comparing DS3 to the previous game in the series DS2, which I find to be more balanced of a pvp experience, and way more enjoyable. Sure, the story sucked, and the level design was meh, but the pvp aspect was brilliant, and gave me hundreds of hours to enjoy of it. Dark Souls 3 is just way too buggy and unbalanced to enjoy at this point, avoid it.I'll be playing DS2 until shit gets fixedPVP - 5/10Singleplayer - 9/10",0
Negative,Dark souls is like a gambling machine that makes you feel like you are winning when you are not.it makes you go around in circles like a goldfish in bowl.,0
Negative,"Ok, I've sunk enough time into the game to write this, so here goes. As a Dark Souls game, this is my favourite one so far. The world is huge, the bosses are awesome, the music is grand and the whole game is just, stunning! Everything about the game itself is just brilliant and I love it. However.The PC-version itself? Dreadful! Huge FPS drops, stuttering and even a few crashes! The online play is horrible. There have been quite a few instances of me trying to summon people, only to have them not be able to pass through the fog walls to the boss. Even invaders suffer from this. I had someone invade me, only to have him be stuck in the t-pose and not be able to attack me. It is a mess. So really, dont buy this yet. Just dont. Wait for fixes and patches and whatnot. Or buy the PS4 or Xbox One version. They have an FPS cap. but at least the game works. Great game, crap PC Port.",0
Negative,"I was already a Souls Veteran when I first played Dark Souls 3 in 2016 and was so disappointed that I never touched the game after my first playthrough for over 3 years. When I came back having forgotten everything, I replayed it and was so reassured that DS3 is to me one of the most unfun games I have played to date and it is made by my favourite developer of all time. Now that Elden Ring is out and costs 60 dollars and has way more content than DS3 with DLC, which STILL costs 90 dollars combined, there is no reason to ever consider DS3. Even if we would ignore that Elden Rings content is on average so much better than DS3, the value proposition is just so bad that you should never touch this if you have Elden Ring and you should never touch this if you don't either, because YOU SHOULD JUST GO PLAY ELDEN RING.Here is where my bad experience comes from: 1. The game is wildy unbalanced. First time I played through the game as a dex/int character and it was so difficult that despite this game being by far the shortest in the series (definitely half the size of DS2), for the tiny amout of content it took me 44 hours. The second playthrough I played as a mundane strenght guy with just a large club and no thought put into it. I died less than 10 times to bosses in total. It took me only 14 hours to complete the game and it was a complete joke. Magic is terrible, Faith I hear is even worse. Having a pure physical damage character makes the game easier than a ubisoft game.2. The basic design philosophy is that mundane stuff is strong and cool stuff is terrible. Hey, you found a cool weapon that has cool moves? It sucks ass. You found a weapon art that looks really cool on a sword? It's terrible. You want to make a creative build based on cosplaying your favourite character? You will get punished immediately because the game is 100 percent linear and you can't even get the all the stuff you need till the game is almost over and that is if that stuff even exists. You want to be a knight in regular knight armor swinging a regular straight sword? Press R1 and spam roll and you are the god of this world. You want to play a regular dude with a big piece of wood in your hand? Congratulations you now can kill any boss in less than 10 hits.3. Time is convoluted. Solaire has one line saying this and it seems to me the writers used this to make everything in the game permissible even if it makes zero sense by every rule the previous titles established in the world. This is done so that we can have unlimited fan service and don't have to pay attention if random neat stuff actually makes any sense. Do you like reused NPCs that make no sense lorewise? Did you think that the cycle of the undead made way too much sense? Did you hate the narrative of the previous games and wanted something that you have to think about for only a few seconds until it doesn't make sense anymore and you have to tell yourself that time is convoluted in your head constantly so that you don't go mad that a cannon entry in your favourite franchise breaks any sense of coherency? Well here you go. The fire can now resummon Souls that it used as fuel and hollows who failed at kindling can be brought back to life by the flame any time as well to rekindle it, even though that isn't necessary as the flame can in theory just resummon Gwyn at its center 1000 times and keep running forever.4. There was way too little time put into making a unique memerable experience with depth and way too much time put into appeasing people who don't understand these games in depth (lore, world, leveldesign, community), but only thought they were cool because they beat a Souls game. This game is short. Like, really short for a Fromsoft game. A quarter of the bosses are gimmick bosses that didn't take much time to develop at all. The multiplayer is very lack luster, they didn't give you any arena until much later that you had to pay for in a very poor DLC package (I never picked up the DLCs because I didn't want to support the massive step in the wrong direction DS3 was). They removed all interesting convenants. They removed all the fringe mechanics that made the previous game's multiplayer so charming. NG+ is not NG+, it is New Game scaled up. They didn't take the time to change anything in this already really short game. So much of the game is fanservice. This is old dragonslayer from DS2 times 100. Entire areas are pure fanservice, with no reason other than: The fanboys are gonna love this. So from the tiny amount of content, there is so little left that is actually DS3. It is 100 percent linear. There is only ever one path to progress. Sometimes, you get optional areas, but those never lead anywhere. There is one way to beat DS3 and one way only. It takes the streamline of the first part of DS, with the lack of interconnectivity of DS2, the worst of both worlds.5. The potential was immense. I really, really loved Dark Souls for its deep environment and interconnectedness. I loved DS2 for its originality, freedom and community. I loved both those games for the deep coherent lore and experiences I never could have had in other games. DS3 felt like a poor imitation that didn't understand what made the previous games. It is the wet dream of a shallow Dark Souls fan that goes on reddit and watches memes about Solaire, Patches and DS = hard, when they think about Dark Souls. It is the worst nightmare of somebody that loved all parts of the Souls games, not just the keywords game journalists throw around.For me the day I finished DS3 for the first time, was the day the Soul of Souls died forever. I was really happy when I remembered that Miyazaki said this would be the last Souls game. And much happier when I played Elden Ring and found out that Miyazaki has learned from his mistakes and took a 180 away from this mess to create an Anti-DS3.",0
Negative,"First off, this game is very challenging and I have only played it a little bit. I think the game has the potential to be a lot of fun, but this is about the LAZIEST game port I have ever seen. All the control representations and beginning tutorial is all in XBOX controls so you need to lookup the settings and google how to do what. Why bother with releasing a game for a platform when you can't even just swap out the XBOX control icons with the correct PC controls? Is it THAT hard? Navigating the menus is also horribly designed and I had to Google ""How to quit out of Dark Souls 3 on PC"". I had some control issues where my player would randomly run in a different direction. I feel like if you want to play this game, you should probably play it on the XBOX or PS4.",0
Negative,"Darksouls 3 to sum it up is a experience u will not find whit the other souls like games honestly the pve just fells lacking and mostly easy to beat besides a few parts that will surprise u once and kill u and then be quickly learned and overcome the pve overall is mediocre whit quickly forgotten enemies and plenty of bosses u wont remember 10 minutes after u beat them whit a few exceptions, the music and felling of the world are definitely its strong suit, while weapons are plenty they mostly all fell the same besides there weapon are that u will rarely use in pve, and the magic was fun to use but in most places it made the already somewhat easy pve fell like a joke, as for the pvp/coop side it used to be very enjoyable whit invaders and co op players about all the time a helping hand or boot to kick u of in every area it sadly mostly turned into either making a post to find any help or being invaded by a twink trying to ruin a new players day or a hacker blasting your character and possibly save file to bits, if u are locking for a challenging experience then by all means play it but i recommend keeping your game offline as the leftovers of invaders and such u will meet as a new player will make it worst by not offering a fight or fun time but a quick death by hacks and exploits and if u are looking for a pvp time there are still some organized pvp communities that are fair and free of hackers but normal random pvp is not fun anymoreAs it is right now i give it a 6/10 Not bad not great",0

Also I played up to the final boss without knowing it and then the servers went down deleting my character so I had to start over.updated review: tried playing a mage, didn't know the game could get worse.tl;dr: trial and error isn't hard, nor is it fun.",0
Negative,"PLAY OFFLINE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, rampant hacker problem and trying to do co-op only makes it worse as invasions target worlds with more than one players so its always a gank, AND invaders can heal with estus ruining any sense of honor in the game. You can't upgrade armor. Bosses aren't too hard, they just have too much health making fights last WAY longer than they should, and the multitude of one hit kill moves they have is a bit unnecessary. Bland weapons and moves sets, and a lack of ANY poise makes is just awful to play.Dark Souls 2 did PvP and weapons right with power stancing, an awesome mechanic that wasn't included in DS3, and no, I don't count the weapons that split into two, that's just lazy rip off of what DS2 did better. The movement feels nice and fluid, I'll give it that, but level design is really bland. I mean, a scaled down version of Anor-Londo that is only scaled down to try to make it look different and cover up the fact there are tons of low resolution textures as the whole set was simply imported from the original Dark Souls. And the rest of the areas are just kinda boring/standard (you got your mandatory poison swamp, a castle, library, forest, spoopy catacombs, dragon area, a second Firelink shrine that is just pitch dark so you can't tell is copy/pasted, and a prison that is suspiciously similar to tower of Latria in Demon's Souls). Countless infinite stamina enemies that never stop attacking EVER with combos that, if you're caught by them, you might as well let yourself die. That's just a lazy way to make the enemies harder. They pull too hard on the nostalgia strings, trying to bring back old things you'd recognize from past games (onion knight, lots of armor sets and weapons *cough* Moonlight Great Sword *cough* and areas like the aforementioned Anor-Londo, even characters like Andre).Do not waste your money on this. If you really want it, wait for a sale.",0
Negative,This game is horribly optimized. It is almost unplayable as no matter the circumstances the game just stutters every 45-60 seconds no matter if you are staring at a wall or walking through a forest. Textures only pop in 5 feet in front of you and sometimes your inputs just stop working. Great game but horrible optimization. Buy at your own risk.,0
Negative,"Game's servers have been taken down due to a malicious exploit. My guess is that From Software/Bandai Namco will allow their servers to stay down until the release of Elden Ring, as they have ZERO incentive to fix their servers when they have more to gain from shifting the playerbase from older games to the new release.Bandai Namco will use this opportunity to hype train Elden Ring and ignore older releases of Dark Souls.

Negative,"This game looks amazing, but lacks the qualities that made Dark Souls so good. Balanced, finessed duels are replaced here by enemies with seemingly unlimited stamina and poise, putting certain builds at a serious disadvantage. The lore feels the same way. It's like the writers were struggling to justify all the copy-pasted elements from the first game. Dark Souls was one of a kind.

Unfortunately most of it is spent re-doing the same thing over and over because of constant crashes. I've tried putting lighting on low. I heard a rumor about starting as Knight. Didn't work. Apparently full helmets cause the crashes. Took it off, didn't work. It took about 8 attempts to open the door after Gundyr without it crashing, and when I finally got through, I crashed at the first enemy afterwards.",0
Negative,"Honestly this game is pretty decent, but it's easily the most frustrating game in the series.The removal of poise is a mistake. Through and through, there is zero argument. This alone enables almost every single flaw in the game. It is NEVER your turn in this game, enemies will flail at you endlessly R1 spamming you, forcing even longer wait times in combat than Zelda: Ocarina of Time. Now that's a feat.Thanks to bloodborne being so popular we now have to deal with rolls taking up 1/6th of your stamina even without endurance upgraded. Why would that be a good thing? It makes PVP a joke right up there with chain backstabbing. Also the parry windows in pvp are insane in this game. They are so obnoxiously long that anyone with half a brain can do it. The only way to fight is through baiting parries or using weapon art attacks/sorceries/miracles.There is a huge difference in the queue system of attacks in this game from other games. What I mean is, if you get hit just as you try to roll. No matter how long the hitstun is. you are going to roll when your character is free again. This just literally sets you up to lose your tempo. It's not fun, it doesn't make you think about every action. It does not improve the game in any way and it creates constant dissonance between taking risks and feeling like you've been cheated by a misinput.This is just dark souls with only the flaws of bloodborne. It's incredibly frustrating, because this game has good bosses. It has loads of build variety, enemy variety, and some great locations. But the core fundamentals are just lacking. It requires the most patience in the series easily and if you HATED R1 spammers in any other souls game just run screaming in the other direction cuz this game will not be fun for you.Get Elden Ring. It's worth it's price. This game has never sold under 30 dollars CAD WITHOUT DLC, and it will never be worth that 7+ years later.",0
Negative,"Tl;dr: if you loved DS1 and DS2 and thought they were just right, you might feel let down by DS3.This review is about game mechanics only.I'm not allergic to change. I'm really not. Initially I loved that the game went for a more Bloodborne deal: fast enemies, no poise. But I eventually got disappointed that this game is too unlike the predecessors, in a bad way. Let me explain.Some enemies feel like they were tailor made to punish players that were expecting to play a certain way. This is normally expected to a point with sequels, but I believe they went too far in the wrong direction. Take both the DLCs for instance: them being post-endgame content is no excuse IMO for some not-even-rare mobs to have boss-levels of HP and gigantic combos. The difficulty comes not from enemies with tricky patterns, but because they have so much much HP that your chances of screwing up go up. And then there's a bunch of these enemies, and they respawn. By this point in the game you will have mastered the art of running past everything, but it got me wondering why even have the mobs there if the optimal strategy is to not even engage. It isn't hard but fair, but simply annoying. It's less 'this area applies pressure' and more 'I'm not gonna bother'. IMO they got the balance wrong - falls too hard on the 'hard' scale, with no good rewards for overcoming.Another sin in my book are some of the base game/almost all the DLC bosses. There's simply too many bosses with multiple phases, tens of thousands of HP, adds and 'enraged' modes, sometimes all at once. Instead of something that happens to spice things up, it becomes routine. Too many bosses where you get to view phase one 10 times for each phase two (or three) attempt. It's exasperating, quickly becomes unfun, and doesn't quite engender a frustration like the earlier games, where you felt you were right on the cusp of overcoming. Instead it's just painfully boring. You could say I am simply too used to duel boss fights, and you'd be right - it's what I've come to expect. But bosses with 18 thousand hitpoints across three distinct phases? It's like someone's idea of difficulty is just hitpoint inflation. So I suppose what I'm saying is that by the time I got to the DLC, if I wasn't aware of the general art style and design, I wouldn't say I was playing Dark Souls, but some parody of it, where they got the surface details right but everything else wrong.If you resonate with any of what I've written, at most get the base game.

Negative,"TL;DR: The game is a tacked on footnote of closure to a series that needed more innovation like Bloodborne, rather than a rehashed sequel.In one word, ""meh."" While the game is certainly better in certain aspects than previous entries, it still exists in a world where those previous entries also existed, so certain aspects are expected to be improved upon as the developers were able to learn from their miistakes. Overall though, I feel like Dark Souls 3 does not learn from all of the mistakes of the other games. I was not gripped by the story; I found myself pretty much indifferent. The world in 3 is unintersting, and just feels like a nonconsequentil jaunt from area to area. Even Dark Souls 2, the mess that it was, had interesting aspects to its world and story; raising interesting questions while exploring new aspects to the world. Dark Souls 3 feels like a rehash with zero identity of its own. Gameplay is not rewarding. What appears to be fast paced and tacital can almost always be beaten with r1 spam from light weapons. Weapons themselves feel less unique than in Dark Souls 1 or 2. The added weapon arts are almost all useless. Wepons themeselves feel shallow. Dark Souls 2, again, a flawed game, at least put effort into making movesets serve a purpose. Dark Souls 3 just tries to jam flashy, overly-acrobatic movesets on its snowflake boss weapons. Enemies feel less methodical and more suited for a faster paced game like Bloodborne. Fights are annoying rather than engaging. Dark Souls earned it's more intense fights, while in 3 every enemy seems to be ripped from some anime. I don't feel the DLC's justify their own existence or price either. 6/10",0

Negative,"THIS IS REALLY GOOD.BUT.EY CLICKBAIT, I love this game and the series but the optimisation for this game is too poor atm. Too many times have i missed a parry or died because the frame drop from 40-60 down to 1 fps for up too 10 seconds. With that type of frame drops PvP is much harder and you'll have to hope the FPS doesnt drop when you walk into a new area. Btw im running darksouls on a GTX 980 (used to be on max but now on Low in hopes that it owuld help the frames)atm so i would hope that the card would be able to handle this.If/When the frame drops are addressed ill change this back. Ontop of this PvP is pretty lacking atm as it is near impossbile to punish those who constantly chug, and also allows the host to summon multiple summons wile invavded.For example i was dueling with a host but as soon as he is low he summoned a phantom to kill me, PvP is really weighted towards the host at this time.ALSO I love the rest of this game, the story, PvE, interactions but i was looking for PvP =/",0
Negative,"Spent alot of time on this game(by my standards). Lived in Bloodborne on PS4. I am really having my doubts about this company now. They ignored a critical flaw in their netcode for more than a year. They got exposed on twitch and finally took the network down. It is a shame that the maker of this classic franchise had to be exposed publicly before they would lift a finger to fix a vulnerability that results in anything from corrupted saves to bricked hardware. Now their new game is about to go online with the same problem. Either it delays or launches without multiplayer. Sadly, I am to far in for a refund, but others can be warned.",0
Negative,"The Dark Souls Series has been great, and has improved visually each time. This game was fun, but like that last Souls prior. It gets quite old ( Rinse and Repeat). I do like that multiplayer has been made easier, but with that being said. Making it easier, also made the connections with invaders or summons worse. Like I said I did enjoy the game, the story, and the world. But being invaded by near invincible people, or people whose bodies stay in the default position, which in turn makes them impossible to kill, see them swing, cast ect. Playing past ng plus or more, is again more or less pointless, you gain a few plus 2 rings but nothing really worth the extra time. I guess I would say I would enjoy the game a bit more had the connections and phatom range ect. been fixed, but with all that bs it makes multiplayer boring, and quite lacking in the fun area. When you do get a decent connection PVP can be fun, but thats rare. So after less then a 100 hours play time I will be saying good bye.at least till the dlc launches and thats complete. Otherwise, I do not recommend this game as replayable like its intention.",0
Negative,"Not for keyboard and mouse user. It may say it does. but this a controler game. UI is un-friendly. Did run well, look good, but this game is not for me.",0
Negative,I can't get past the first boss.,0
Negative,"I've played through this game several times both on PC and PS4. Enjoyed both the PvP and PvE gameplay, and didn't ever use anything outside the game for any advantages. No cheat engine manipulations or anything. I haven't played for over a year and decided to try and play today. I'm now softbanned for no evident reason. This detection for cheating in this game must be absolute ass. What an awful way to end the series, and to only follow it up with that joke of a remaster.",0
Negative,"Yet another DS completely ruined by forced PvP, would have been such a great game if people were allowed to play like they wanted.If you do not LOVE PvP, and yes, u gotta LOVE it, cuz you WILL be invaded all the time, while doing quests and other stuff, and ofcourse NPC's ignore the invader but start fighting you while try to fight the invader, you can even be invaded in offline mode now.DO NOT BUY",0
Negative,"Over 300 hours and I still love it! It's great if you are looking for a hardcore-singleplayer RPG.If you play alone the sense of progression you get is really awesome not only your character but also your skill grows over time. The lore is awesome although you have to dig very deep to find it and even then not everything is clear, but i consider this part of the fun! The PvP is really fun and feels accomplishing when you kill 2 or 3 people on your own, although i think the invasion system still needs some work, as invaders have to many handycaps. Most of the bosses get ridiculously easy when you summon phantoms in though. I recommend playing it without searching in the internet for questline solutions and similar things because the the feeling of finding this huge questline on your own is priceless. If you want a good coop game however, I do not recommend this game, because you will have to progress through the level two or three times, depending on the number of people you are playing with and you need an ember, an ingame item, to be able to summon phantoms and if you die you have to get another one of those items. I would rate Darksouls 9/10 because of the great experience I had and will continue to have with it, however not the full 10/10 for the flaws I namend.[EDIT] Over 900 hours now and I mostly agree with what I wrote, such a great game![EDIT] 2k hours, game is trash.[EDIT] that last one was a joke but now for real, play offline. Only people still playing this are loser cheaters who got their accounts banned and can't make infinite alts for free for Elden Ring.",0
Negative,"How do you review a series you enjoyed through many installments and through two different platforms? I will be reviewing dark souls 3 in a pro/ con style and end with my final conclusions.Pro: Nice scenery. The game looks amazing with the better graphics overhal compaired to previous installments. Besides that every location you go to looks nice and unique, easy to tell the difference between one location compaired to another. To add to that the different worlds are filled with enemies that feel cohesive to their respective land. The music is great. I enjoy the music that is played at the fire link shrine and also the boss music for the abyss watchers. Plenty of weapons to use. There are many of weapons from your basic solo weapons like swords, maces, ect. Now they add in the feature to have dual weapons. So the player must equip it to whatever hand they wish and they will use a single weapon but if they two hand it.the character will have 2 of that weapon. It is cool and can provide some neat combat moves.Con: The reuse of old enemies. It is less like they tried to add new things but made the game based on things fans liked from old dark souls games. Really it is pretty lazy and i did not want to see the wheel skeleton enemies or multiple variations of the first boss in dark souls 1. The lack of choice in dark souls since dark souls 2. What dark souls 2 easy? yes but it had choice to it. It allowed the player to experience the game on an easier level while if players challenge themselves they could do that with their own choice. None of that is here in this game which really sucks. The enemy placement is pretty bad which messes up flow even for this game. The idea of putting tank like enemies on narrow platforms is a horrible idea. I dont mind challenge but what this is.it is not a challenge rather poor level design. Dark souls 3 takes inspiration from old dark souls and bloodborn. That is cool but the issue is that dark souls isnt bloodborn. Bloodborn is a fast pace dark souls game that has its mechanics dealing around being agressive and quick dodging and such. Dark souls is not that. What dark souls is.is slower and more thoughtful as to when to strike and when to dodge roll. The bosses in the two series are different and combining them in this game is a beautiful mess. It provides a clash between mechanics and combat. There is a swamp level that not only does it poison the player similar to lower blight town from dark souls but it is unbarebly slow. Sure there is a way to speed it up but why is it even here? It feels like a checklist in all souls and souls like games.Conclusion: In short i am a major dark souls fan. Played all the souls games except bloodborn on multiple different platforms till I 100% it but this game is tied for the most unenjoyable souls experience with dark souls 1 and salt and sanctuary. It is not that i am a casual because that is obviously false but it deals with how enemies are really agressive like playing bloodborn but clashing with the slower pace of dark souls. Could i reccommend the game.no. Sure the game looks better and the music is nice but the issues are a big problem.",0

Negative,"Impossible to play with mouse and keyboard. Crashes steam whenever running on steam link,",0
Negative,Keyboard and mouse options? Good luck! Messy messy gameplay and the developers were too lazy to convert the controller commands on tutorial level and never even bothered with PC players. I will not recommend this game until they actually learn to patch it up for PC players. Wasted $80 for this terrible game.,0
Negative,Temporary review.This is the first time I have not been able to get a game to run on steam.Constant white screen flickering when playing in fullscreen. (Windowed works on max settings @ 60fps but I didn't buy this game to play windowed),0
Negative,bad pc port. the fact that this game is capped at 60 fps and has controller promps for everything even tho your playing with M+K is terrible.,0
Negative,Basically fuck you and your fps. If anyone has any knowledge on how to fix framerate issues please help. I guess I'm just lucky mine isn't crashing like others have said.,0
Negative,"This is for PC, they should at least an option for showing the keyboard bindings not the controller bindings for the hint pop-ups. I could see how this game would be fun for some people, I am not one of them. I prefer to use bows, this game doesn't seem to really offer much on bows from the start of the game - maybe plenty of bow action later in the game, but doesn't matter if I don't stick around long enough to find out. It would have been nice if there was a bow for purchase from the lady or blacksmith right after the starter area boss.Invasions are just annoying for new players trying to learn the game. I can see how invasions would be a lot of fun after you have played the game for a bit though.",0
Negative,"Ok as a stand-alone game but a disappointment as a Dark Souls title.Gone is the world exploration from 1 and 2 that tried to railroad you with seemingly overwhelming enemies for that stage in the game which could be overcome with skill - what's left is basically a stage by stage slugfest.You've only twice in the journey a choice of which stage to handle first but you have to do both anyway.While you could in the past route a way through the game to find your main weapon possibly much earlier than intended this is simply not possible here.Beyond that the story is kinda incomplete.In past titles you had 3 stages:1) proof yourself worthy (ring the bells, overcome a certain door)2) collect some token(s) to access the final stage (lord vessel + 4 souls, king's ring)3) journey to the final bossDS3 skips 1 and goes from 2 right to the final boss.You don't have to prove your worth, you just are. Simply collect the souls and be done with it.No real plot twist to speak of either.Absent are also poise, power stance, bonfire ascentics, and a lot of more things that made the past 2 games fun.TL;DR: not my dark souls",0
Negative,"Dark Souls 3 looks like a great game, and the sort of thing I could really sink my teeth into, but in 2018 when you install a game the last thing you expect is major input lag.The game actually runs fine in other respects. Even on ""max"" settings it doesn't stress my computer at all and the system doesn't go much over 20 C (when this machine is being hammered it sits at about 70 C and blasts hot air out of the radiator), but my god the input delay is awful.Call it ""input buffering"" all you like but other games don't have that kind of game-breaking delay.Just google ""Dark Souls 3 input lag"" for an overdose of 1990s PC gaming troubleshooting fest nostalgia.This is not the 90s.I'm not trying to run Doom on an Amiga.And I'm not jumping down the rabbit hole of tweaking and hacking the game to get it to maybe do what I take for granted with every other game.Refunded.",0

Negative,very fun game yes okay,0
Negative,"Fantastic sequel to Dark Souls. Dollar per hour ratio is ok. It really depends though, if you can not play a game twice wait for a sale. If you can this game is definatley worth it at $60. I think it would be unfair for me to assume everyone can play a dark souls game twice, therefore I do not recommend this game at it's current price of $60. This game is worth about $40 taking age and length of story into account.",0

Negative,my dick fell off,0
Negative,No cloud saves?,0
Negative,"No recommendations from me due to certain ideas that is within this game.1. If you have limited time to play, invaders are really wasting your time. That is a stupid concept. There is no open world and private lobby like in other games like Grand Theft Auto Five. The developers do not consider your preference or need. It seems theirs is the best.2. There is this stupid penalty that you get when you get disconected. System crash would deem you as being disconnected and you would eventually be penalized and not be able to summon or join your friend for at least 14 hours. Is this game worth to get you penalized for something that was system problematic? Or maybe the game caused the crashed in the first place?Though the game looks interesting, it does not warrent such stupid behaviours like those I have mentioned above. It is good only for personal game, if you have the time that is.Edit: The gap in letency is just horrible. Invaders with least letency have the fullest advantage to hit every time. The developers could at least thought about it and planned regions for the PvP. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME if you are very from their server or your Internet frequently gets disconnected. It is a wise warning.",0
Negative,"This game is way more of a grind than Elden Ring. For those who want to get into this after playing Elden Ring. I am towards the end of the game, and its just become a boring grind. It was fun to explore Elden Ring when you needed to level up your character, this game just finds you doing the same loops over and over again, killing the same three or four guys, then refreshing at the fire. I am sooooooo bored with this game. I was having fun at the start but now its just the same thing over and over. There is no point going back to earlier areas, because you barely get any souls to level your character. I am sick of it. And I have over 300 hours in Elden Ring, have played through multiple NG+s and regular new games, and I never got bored with Elden Ring. Just over this game.",0
Negative,"Game forces you back into the loading screen if it decided that suddenly your framerate isn't suitable for online play.Dumbest online mechanic i have ever seen in any game, i loved the former souls titles, but sadly this one is virtually unplayable right now, might change review if they fix this.",0

Downloaded the game, set up my stream and got all my viewers excited to watch the game, then about 1.5 hrs in, after the first boss fight, the game crashed. I chalked it up to my PC juggling too many things at once. Fired up the game again, and non-stop crashing. People say put ""lighting"" on ""low"". I've had all my settings on ""low"". Still crashes. People say ""play as the knight"" as they say it doesn't crash. For me, still crashes my game. Even crashes when the only thing I'm running is the game, so it's not my stream setup.It's appalling that such a triple A title game would be this buggy at launch. Get your sh!t together FromSoftware/Bandai Namco!I would change this review to positive if I could actually play the game.",0
Negative,I dont ilike the fact that you fasdt travel at the start thats also a comon complaint but it couldve been changed pretty easily. Theres not a good sense of adventure at any part of the game because of the fast travel. The mapo is laid out beautifully AN DI THINK its just a waste of good mapo design to make the player teleport everywhere cmon man. The game hgas some interesting shotrtcuts but they are all made redudnat beacuese of the teleporting. The game couldve easily vbeen designed around a firelink esue area like the first game but no the devs chose not to do that comn son. But anyway I like the game it's the third best soulsborne game if I choose to ignore te latter half of ds1 hwich I will.I was made aware that the game costs 60 euros it is NOT WORTH that amount of money I would know. Buy it maybe if its beow 20euros or something and you can't play bloodborne or Dark Souls 1 or 2.,0

Negative,Spent a bunch of time trying to put together a magic build and when I finally found a scroll it was too late to turn into the guy who sells you spells. Now I can't use the late game spells because I didn't google half the game before because they literally remove him PERMANENTLY for no reason. Can't they just make it a shitty side quest to get him back or something? This game is needlessly inaccessible and I wish I could get my money back.,0
Negative,I find it crazy that this game has been out since 2016 and the crashing issues still haven't been fixed and none of the things i've found online have been helpful. I've got over 2 hours of in game play time and thats only having the game launched trying to get it to work. THIS IS FUCKING SAD! I'm beyond PISSED!

Negative,"I used to like this game. I really don't know why.In 2020 I tried doing another play through. I thought I was enjoying it till about 18 hours in I realised I really don't like this game. I was forcing myself to play it. Even in co-op neither of us were having fun. The Bloodborne styled combat, the infinite stamina and poise on enemies. The amount of garbage weapons and magic. The copy paste of enemies everywhere. The broken netcode and constant invasions of twinkers and cheaters.I just can't with this game anymore.I get more enjoyment out of DS1 & 2 and even Bloodborne.I want to like this game, I really do. But right now, I personally think it's just in a bad state and not worth playing.",0

Negative,"A whole lot better than 2, but not as memorable or good as 1. The game's world feels so, bland.A lot of the time I felt myself dreading getting a certain item just because I had to trudge though X area. This never happened to me in DS1. The hubworld is shit, and I can't believe they kept leveling up with the firekeeper a thing. Thanks for making me have to sit through two loading screens just so I can end up right back where I was. Cool. The bosses are non memorable; half of the bosses being a literal joke. PVP, is ok, but parrying feels very DS2, which is shit. Final boss is a letdown, and is just ""le nostalgia fighty gywn man fanservice"" for fans of the first game. I'm a fan of the first game, but they really should have done something different and more grand. Once again, the game's lore and characters are complete BULLSHIT. There is no way in HELL ANYONE would be able to get certain items in the game, or access certain areas without a walkthrough or searching it up online. (You know what area I'm talking about.) The world and the characters should drop slight hints, give you SOMETHING. They don't say jack shit in this game, they just repeat the same dreary bullshit, and then; oh, you can't get that item anymore sorry.I wanted to get all achievements for this game, but there is no way in hell I am suffering though the boring trudge of going through NG to NG+3; something which once again, I had no problem doing in DS1. I really wanted to like this game, I really did. But playing through it again for the sake of the DLC really opened my eyes.5/10Get it if its on sale",0

Negative,"Dark Souls 3 is a spectacle, many areas are big, open, and highly detailed, but at the same time, completely empty. It wants to be a game where you look at the environment and go ""woah"" but there is just nothing happening to actually warrant any interest. the bosses are some of the best in the franchise, but a few were designed simply to frustrate players by directly countering specific common playstyles. the story is Dark Souls 1 but big, pretty much every part of DS3 directly correlates to a part of DS1. if you liked DS1 and wished it controlled more like Elden Ring, this is th e game for you",0
Negative,Button promps have not been switched from the Xbox controller. I also didn't realize this was ported from the console. Wanted a refund but was denied because it was more than two weeks. I didn't install the game for a month because I bought it on sale and planned to wait to play it. Lame situation. I'll remember this when I think about buying anymore games.,0
Negative,"Summary:A lumbering, tedious, and drab farewell to the series.Review:Let's be clear right off; Dark Souls 3 is not a bad game, but it is in many ways inferior to its predecessors. Dark Souls was a new and interesting take on the 3rd person adventure game. Its minimalist storytelling, grungy environments, and steep difficulty spikes built it a reputation for being one of the hardest games of its kind, which is very untrue. Trial and error, patience and repetition were all it took to win, though a few FAQs were needed to understand or explore the game's often confusing narratives and baffling world design.Dark Souls 2 built on this, expanding in some areas and regressing in others.Dark Souls 3 is a hodgepodge of some elements from the first two games, lazily tacked over corridor world design, cheap ambushes, and enemies with a ton of stamina and unbelievable combo strings.The story is part of the discovery and while I won't spoil it, I will say that this time around I was almost totally checked out. It's not just that it's too cryptic, lazy, or vague; I was just bored with it. If it had no narrative at all I might have been able to at least cruise by on the action, but whenever an NPC had something to say I would just mentally check out. Inane isn't quite the right word for it, but it isn't wrong either.Firelink Shrine, the game's hub, is populated by an array of stiff-to-lame voice acted characters with uninspired scripts. They said little of substance, and what they had to say was often said as slowly as possible, with long pauses between parts of lines. This has always been the case with the series, but somehow feels more pronounced this time. Thankfully there isn't a lot of dialogue, regretfully, most of it is just so bland.The sound in this game was equally annoying. Some sounds seem recycled from earlier games (as were some items), whether by design or other constraints, I couldn't say. In most cases the monsters were unnecessarily shrill. I appreciate that a dragon's roar should be mighty and impressive, but shrill and irritating? The same with a lot of enemies, whether attacking or being slain; they'd shriek, screech, and otherwise scream into the ear like harpies. Meanwhile other sound effects are much quieter, even difficult to hear. Turn up the volume to hear what someone's telling you? Hope for your sake you remember to turn the volume back down again before killing something. Better sound balancing could have created a stronger sense of atmosphere, but here it's low speaking NPCs, loud shrieking everything else.The level design felt really linear; almost no room for deviation. You will be funneled from one area to the next with no real options. Previous games had forks or fields, all of which generally lead to the same destination, but at least in those you could choose your way to the next exit. Some areas were terribly convoluted in their approach, ultimately feeling like a singular winding hallway pretending to be broader than a corridor.Many areas were also uninspired. There were some that looked really great, including the starting area leading up to Firelink Shrine, which with all settings on max looked beautiful and haunting. Most other areas were just castles, dilapidated villages, or swamps. Firelink shrine itself was overly complicated, making the travel between NPCs for interactions like dialogue or purchases unnecessarily long.The combat varies, but is effectively about timing and balancing stamina for offense and defense. It felt like a big step backward from Dark Souls 2, but still closer to Dark Souls. Parry and riposte return, but the damage rewarded for pulling it off is sparse compared to previous games, as is the bonus damage for a back-stab. Buff items are weak, lasting only for a few seconds, and giving minimal effects.Enemies are combo machines with high stamina and ridiculous combo strings, and rather than being well-developed AI wise they just repeat long combos until your guard breaks or you die or both. It does force more offense than defense, but it doesn't do so in a way that didn't feel cheap and lazy. The AI seems pretty dumb, which is offset by grouping and making them damage sponges and having them spam long combos over absurd distances.This game was played with all settings maxed out using an Intel i7-8700k, 32gb DRAM, Samsung Evo SSD, 1080ti, running at 3440x1440. Ultrawide wasn't possible without third-party fixes, and even then there were some issues, and I had to play strictly offline (Steam and all) just to ensure From's inconsistent banning policy didn't snare me. If it is a matter of fairness, why not permit ultrawide and just overlay the edges of the screen to ensure both sides are locked at 16:9? Just an idea.Pros: Visually excellent Controls feel mostly responsive Some beautiful environments Plenty of secrets to discover Vast array of spells and weaponsCons: Most weapons redundant or pointless Level complexity only skin deep Ambiguous/nebulous online banning policy Had to play offline to enjoy Ultrawide Ultrawide needed modding to work Lazy enemy AI Uninspired combat More linear than before Mostly drab and repetitive environments Constant screeching and volume spikesVerdict: 06/10Maybe it was the repetition, maybe the frustratingly high level of cheap ambush corridors, or maybe facing enemies that had absurdly high stamina and combo strings. As much as I tried, I just wasn't able to enjoy this game. The score is average, but I can't recommend it to anyone but series die-hards.",0
Negative,"I understand that one of the selling point of Dark Souls 3 is its intensive combat styles and mechanics, however, after trying it myself, I am not a huge fan. The lore of the game is deep, the graphics is still beautiful on today's standard, but the combat struggle stopped me from progressing very far into the game unfortunately. I just do not enjoy the ""git gud"" play style. I play games for mild reward and enjoyment at the very least, and not just endless grinding through challenges. I will recommend this game with caution!Genre: 3rd person RPG, dungeon based adventure",0
Negative,"As someone who likes the Soul series and played them all, I have to say that I am somewhat disappointed with this game.It feels repetitive as I am playing, I find myself resting at bonfires (of which there are an inane amount) just to know if I am in a new area, enemies are the same for many areas and I am simply getting bored (which never happened in any of the previous games).The enemies become boring and the combat is somewhat lacking, At least not what I am used to from the soul games. This feels more like a Bloodborne 2 then a Dark Souls game.Dont misunderstand me though, it is a good game. But in a legendary series.",0
Negative,"Game has its moments, difficulty of mobs is good learning. I do have to say that the pvp aspect is pretty bullshit. Log in not 30 fucking seconds get invaded. Cannot enjoy this game with friends without Invaders and don't want to put in 1000+hrs to play offline. 5/10",0
Negative,"First day playing and I get invaded by one hacker after another. It's just infuriating.Edit: I came back cause my buds are playing again. I still hate this game. Every thing is way too damn hard. Still getting constantly invaded by people who are massively over powered compared to me. I don't understand how people find this game fun.

You cant play with your friends without getting invaded by dark spirits that are immune to damage.

Negative,"Read through the reviews, watched the videos, and was really enticed, so I purchased.First run crash but finally got it working. Nice visuals running on a Gtx980, that was where to positive experience ended.I assume this must be a console port because all onscreen tooltips refer to A,B, RT, LT, etc . Advanced combat tactics require simultaneous button clicks on a keyboard and mouse to accomplish.

Negative,"The game is terrible.+ good graphic, even for 2020.+ long game.- A very long (20-30 sec) load screen and unnecessary (for single play game) checking the connection with a server. It takes so much time. I bought a top-PC to avoid this time in games.- There is no any Journal/Quest List. I spent a lot of time to understand what to do next.- Unfriendly user interface.- In PC version I have still xbox/ps notification and keys in the setting. I took much time to learn the movement and tricks with a keyboard/mouse.- Bad Camera behaviour, especially in one-on-one with the bosses, where you need to move fast.- Buggy focus. Sometime it disappears and does not work till you restart the game.- The Main Idea of the game is to learn timing of the next boss. It's boring. It's not better than Chrome's hidden dinosaur.",0

Negative,"I've tried really hard to like Dark Souls 3 since it launched. I sat with a good friend and watched him play in on PS4 before I got it on PC. I was hyped since the release trailers started going live. I was a fan of Dark Souls before it was ported to PC, and I was really into Bloodborne even though I didn't have a PS4 of my own to play it on. I even couldn't find a place in my heart or mind to call Dark Souls 2 bad, a good game but a mediocre Souls game. I didn't think FormSoft could make a truly bad Dark Souls game, but here I am.I legitimately think FromSoft's development team just wanted to make Bloodborne 2, but every higher up kept saying ""No, you have to make Dark Souls 3."" and so they did (not). If you've played Dark Souls, Bloodborne, and Dark Souls 3, you'll start to see what I mean. Controlling the character moved from the slow-paced combat from Dark Souls, to the frantic button mashing speedfest that Bloodborne used. There were very few times when I played Dark Souls that I ran into the problem of ""What was that attack? I don't even know what happened."" What I mean by this is that (almost) every attack animationin the first game was very visible and usually had good windup for you to know when to play around it. This let you learn the enemies moves and the speed at which they hit you, you got to ""level up"" in real life and feel rewarded by conquering the enemies that beat you last time. Bloodborne and Dark Souls 3 didn't have this, they didn't want you to sit still in combat and think. Enemies often, and I mean very often, have fast attacks and gapclosers to test your reaction times. A big enemy that lumbers around when you see it out of combat will usually become a speed demon the second they know you're there, and even if you dodge the slow attacks and try to hit them in the back they just do an ""instant"" attack where they spin around and hit you while you're locked in your animation. Where the first Dark Souls had enemies that usually threw out short combos and had decent downtime for you to counter attack, Dark Souls 3 gave almost every enemy long combo chains just to dissuade you from counter attacking which forces you into the speed-filled turbo-action button mash of dodge rolling. Where you could get a good stability shield in the frst game and block the combo, you now have to dodge roll three times in a row without a break or else you get caught up in the enemies 8-hit combo and get stunlocked and die. The first game's combat felt like a thinking man's game (not that you had to be a genius to succeed, you just had to apply yourself) and Dark Souls 3 feels like it's just fast paced combat just to get your adrenaline pumping so you think it's cooler than it is. The problem here is that when you lost to an enemy you fought a bunch in the first game you could fall back and just say ""Wow, I messed up. Why did I do that? I'm such an idiot."" and learn from it. In Dark Souls 3, I usually couldn't figure out what I was doing wrong when fighting certain enemies. Some of the attacks came out so fast, and were partially blocked by my own character that I regularly found myself unable to find out what I did wrong besides ""I baited the wrong attack."" but when I would go back and test what attack the enemy would do at that range, I found that they would sometimes do different moves at random ranges or positions. This was only possible when I was fighting an enemy that I could understand their attacks, which shouldn't be a problem normally. I like the odd enemy that fights very differently from other and I think it can add a lot if done well. Pus of Man enemies do not fall into that category though, and I'll use them as my example. Visually, they're very hard to understand and what I mean by that is that every one of their limbs look similar. On top of that, their ""torso"" is very large and obscures the limbs constantly. Even if I know that they're going to attack with the head, I won't be able to see it coming if I'm it's left side. The sound design for them is terrible as well. There might be 2 whole sound files for their attacks, both of which are just high pitched squeels and shrieks that play way earlier than their attacks start. It was very easy to tie enemy sounds to what attacks they would use in the first game, and this is why I have a problem with this type of enemy. It all feels wrong, and because of that I could never tie what I did wrong to why I died to the Pus of Man. I ended up just spamming them with ranged attacks from a ledge they couldn't hit me from to be able to deal with them. I know it seems like I'm really digging for a cherry to pick right here, but they aren't a one time enemy. There are areas (plural) where you can fight several of them at once, and even if you don't it can be difficult to avoid them entirely. I've been writing this for too long, in my opinion, but I really think that Dark Souls 3 handles combat very diffrently than there first game and I feel like it's worse in almost every regard. Combat stopped being slow and became R1 until they die unless they have Poise. Defensive options turned from distancing yourself from your opponent, dodging, blocking, parrying and baiting attacks to get a sweet counter poke to dodging and parrying only (seriously, watch DS3 PvP and take a shot every time someone panic dodge rolls 4 times in a row when they get low, or try to parry the first attack. You'll be wasted before the first video ends.) 8-direction dodging is about the only improvement. I liked the addition of Bloodborne's charged R2s. I don't like the way they handled removing regular backstabs, but I do like not getting lagstabbed anymore.The art design boasts incredible detail, from far away or if it's not your focus because you're in combat or running around. If you ever stop to look around like I did, you'll notice something that you'll never be able to unsee. Every surface in Dark Souls 3 looks wet. Every surface reflects light off of it as it if were moist at all times. This made sense, somewhat, in Bloodborne. Yharnam was set at night with no sun to evaporate anything, there was a low fog hanging around at all times so condensation was easily plausible even on rooftops. In Dark Souls 3, this doesn't make sense. Most of the game happens during daytime with no rain clouds visible. It happens indoors everywhere, not just in dank, dark, dungeons or sewers. I don't know why FromSoft started having an obsession with everything looking like this, but I assume it's so they could keep a little mechanic I'm going to be harsh about right now. So, you can call me a RP loser or an idiot for liking this, but I REALLY enjoy stopping at scenic points in games and just stop and admire the scene and my character I've boned myself in games by doing this by taking off my characters helmets and forgetting to re-equip them. Bloodborne added this visual touch where blood would splatter on your gear, and it would remember what parts hit your face and what hit your mask so when you removed the equipment, the part of your face that was covered would still be clean. They tried this again in Dark Souls 3 and failed miserably. Because you have to spam the roll button a bunch, and because every surface is permanently wet at all times, your character gets caked in mud within seconds. This happens even if you wear a helmet and take it off after rolling, you will always have blackface (also I lied, I'm not done talking about the combat. There's a system in place with your gear where you gain a certain flat % physical reduction if you equip ANY gear in that armor slot. This means you are actively gimped by an invisible number that doesn't show up on the gear itself if you play without gloves, boots, or a helmet. Want to constantly see the face you made that took you an hour to make? All right, just be ready to take more damage than you should.). I think I'm out of room to write any more, so that's it from me. 4/10 Season Pass",0
Negative,"great bosses, abysmal level design",0
Negative,"Game is BS all the way through, only reason why its hard is because the game mechanics cheat.",0
Negative,"I wouldn't go as far as to call this game a disgrace to the Souls series, but it really pushes that boundary. Dark Souls 3 strays so far away from what made Demon's Souls through Dark Souls 2 enjoyable that it almost doesn't feel like a proper Souls game. This was honestly one of the least enjoyable games I have played in recent times. DS3's biggest flaw is its lack of identity. DS3 suffers greatly from ""sequel syndrome"". With very little innovation and a heavy reliance on DS1 references, this game loses all sense of being its own title. DS3 tries so hard to ride on the success and nostalgia of the first game that it doesn't even feel like a sequel. This game just feels like a bad knockoff of the first. The constant references to DS1 undermine the original due to the frequency with that they occur. You revisit several locations from the first game, and this just feels more lazy than anything. I would have appreciated new locations over revisiting the past. When a sequel feels too much like a previous entry in the series, it risks fatiguing the player. This is exactly the case with DS3. This title doesn't stand out in any major way and feels like a rehash of DS1. The locations in DS3 are all very lackluster. None of the areas you visit in the world of Lothric feel inspired, and the excessive use of castle levels feels boring and repetitive. Normally, large and extravagant castles are used in these games to convey progression. Castles were visited late-game in previous titles as a way to present how far you have come from the start of your journey. In DS3, you start at a castle and visit many more throughout the game, which detracts from the awe you feel when reaching these levels. Castles are no longer something special to look forward to in DS3. The only innovation DS3 brings with it is the boss fights. Unfortunately, these fall flat for the most part. The bosses are now faster than ever, and their move sets are expanded upon. This sounds like a good feature until you notice that the majority of the bosses are massive. Extremely fast attacks and huge bosses do not gel well together. It creates a setting where the hardest part of the bosses is seeing their attacks. Speaking of difficulty, this game is by far the easiest in the series. I believe this is due to the new rolling you can abuse. I was able to beat most bosses within two or three attempts, if not the first. However, difficulty is subjective, so I will not dwell on this. My main complaint with the bosses is that they discourage many builds. I played using an ultra greatsword, which turned out to be highly unenjoyable. The fast movement of the bosses made it hard to use large, heavy swords. I found myself having to trade hits with bosses frequently because I didn't have enough time to roll out after a slow attack, which led to many of the bosses in this game being more frustrating than fun. While graphics aren't something I'd normally comment on, I have to note that DS3 has a lot of aliasing issues. Even with the highest AA setting, there is a lot of distracting aliasing present. This is mainly a problem for the first third of the game as there are many large open areas. One final disappointment I had with DS3 was the OST. There are very few memorable tracks, and they all sound bland and too similar to each other. The only tracks that stood out to me were the Main theme, Vordt theme, and Abyss Watcher theme. Not even the credits song was good. Many of the tracks in this game use an angelic choir of voices, and they get very tiring after the first few times you hear them. While I wouldn't recommend this game in general, there are still several groups of people I think should buy it. If you have played all the games up to this point and are a Souls series fan, then you should buy this; DS3 is just more of the same. In fact, this group has most likely already bought this game. The second group is comprised of people who have already played DS3 and want it on PC. Yes, these people should also buy the game. It is worth getting on PC for mods if you already like the game. Now for the groups I would not recommend this game for: If you haven't played a Souls game before, please do not start with this one. Either play DS1 or Demon's Souls first. For those who have played a Souls game before but not the titles that come before this one, go at least play DS1 and 2 first. I believe one of the reasons for my dislike of this game is that my high expectations were met with great disappointment. DS3 does not live up to the heights of the first two games, and that saddens me to see.",0

Negative,"Darksouls was a really good game it was tuff and sometimes made me nervous, facing bosses or black phantoms, they'd always come and attack some different way it was fun and I hopped to see it get better from there, but it didn't really and that makes me sad.Dark Souls 2 came it was more blocky the animations were kinda bad the bosses were mostly humanoid but didn't really notice because pressure was on! the pvp was awesome and somewhat fair aside from op hex builds or gank squads and super oneshot buffs still very fun. Now Dark Souls 3 the looks are amazing! The animation is like taking Bloodborne and DS together fluid smoth moving emotes and this all makes it look and feel great the bosses are kool and fast with diff moves and epic setups that I wish I had but kno I'll never get! and the story as always is hard to follow but I see the prgress from the other games I liked that a lot! The praise ends there sadly, Dark Souls 3 pvp is terribly broken, to the point where most of the ppl use only rapier that can take out all your hp with no effort one poke and you're dead or duel sword roll stabs that have more reach than they should that can kill you in one shot it's very unfair, I always liked fire mage and magic is awesome but it's debuffed so much here or just not thought out, the aoe fireball can be rolled out of with no effort (even when it connects if they rolled it does no dmg) ou can't lock on with it to hit so there is a gamble and if you throw wrong you'll be killed, the aoe fire storm doesn't connect even when they get hit by the fire, the charge times are crazy and there literally is no way to stand alone keep distance between you and say a katana user running and poking. Pyro isn't only thing that is discouraged, there are the heavy tanks too that lost poise replaced with I frames (which are useless basically) so a poke from anything can stop them that's silly.My only thought is they'll try and put out another DS3+ edition with all dlc and well I don't recommend it for that reason alone.

Since I dont have or want one, all the tooltips are worthless because they are not dynamic for your keyboard layout.All in all I regret buying this game and would advise to spend your money elsewhere.",0

Negative,"This is an edited review: First, I have to play with mouse and keyboard because controllers make my hands hurt. This game is more of an art piece designed specifically for consoles. The mods to make the game make sense for PC players are very difficult to implement. Like the PC version still says stuff like ""A: enter"" or ""right-trigger: auto-level"", forcing you to go into the menu and figure which key you actually need to use. The game is hard but the menu interaction is needlessly difficult. The menu music doesn't stop playing until you click through the first screen and there is no way to turn it off before that. Even muting all music in the settings. The game itself is mostly good though. The only disagreement I have is that the hitboxes for NPCs can be much greater than their animation suggests, making for very frustrating and irrational gameplay. Some people seem to like that. Update: The whole reason i started playing this game is so i could play with my friend, but when we joined up, some other player joined my world and started killing both of us. After that I realized this is an absolute piece of garbage and that nobody in their right mind should have created it. Uninstalling now. Fuck you if you do this to other people and fuck the game devs for allowing it. Eat shit and die.",0
Negative,"Final Boss is nothing more than attack spamming until you die. You cannot beat him unless you get incredibly good RNG. We're talking tracking mid and post attack, infinite attack combos, an actual juggle combo, and hitboxes and timings that do not match the animations. fun to play, impossible to finish solo.EDIT: Apparently when they took the servers down for a security exploit they created a bug or decided to harass players by breaking Abyss Watchers. Now the neutral one focuses only you meaning the fight is 3 on one. IF you survive the boss gets infinite stamina and spam with, no exaggeration, no window to defend or dodge. Thus making the game impossible to solo while co-op is offline. Great job FromSoftware, you managed to butcher a game that had such great potential.",0

We're good to go right?No, there's fucking motion controls enabled by default so the slightest movement of my controller sends my cursor flying around the screen.Okay, no biggie, I'll just find another control scheme with motion controls disabled. Okay NOW we're good right?No fuck you, now there's no audio in the opening cutscene, the speaker sounds like they're playing chinese whispers with me and I can't make out a single fucking word they're saying with my volume cranked to max.I'm starting to get pissed now, but that's fine, I can just skip the cutscene and rewatch it on youtube later.So I start making my character, and then the game decides to minimize itself every 10 seconds. That's my breaking point. I'm surprised at how fucking busted this game is 3 years after launch.If I wanted to fiddle with settings and config files to make my game playable, I'd be playing Skyrim with mods for the umpteenth time.The fact that the game needs so many fixes and tweaks from the user side, and even then still have unplayable bugs popping up nonstop is ridiculous.This isn't the first time I've had problems with Dark Souls on Steam, I can't even play 1 or 2 with my friends because their game either doesn't recognize their controller, or their control scheme was busted for some godforsaken reason.",0

Negative,"Not really a souls fan. But I have had my fair share of ""hard games"". I have finished DS1, cuphead, hollow knight, re8 VOS NG etc. Most of these games feel fair, albeit frustrating. But DS3 is the first game I have ever played that felt that the game hard, but unfair.Not one moment in DS3 really stood out to me. The areas seem linear and uninspiring, the enemies were stupid and buggy, the bosses are gods and have infinite stamina. In contrast in DS1 I really liked the map design that branched off to multiple paths, enemies had more variety IMO and hard but fair bosses. I remember going down to the lava area for the first time and saw a dozen Capra demons, I remember the blight town ferris wheel and jumping off branches of a giant tree, I remember the fortress with lots of traps and rolling boulders.Thinking back at it, I would rather fight 50 more bed of chaos's than another boss in dark souls 3.A few problems that made the game unenjoyable for me:1. Kicking instead of attacking is always frustrating, why would you bind a kick to mouse 1? I cannot tell you how many times I had a boss at 1hp and kicked him instead of attacking. You know what happens next.On the same note, extremely terrible mouse + keyboard support, not only is key binding unmappable, but on screen hints also show controller buttons?2. quite bad optimization for PC, sometimes down to 2X fps for me. In contrast DS1 remastered had 60fps throughout I rmb.3. buffering a roll/attack after taking a hit (up to 2 seconds). Why? Surely if I wanted to roll dodge but failed because I took a hit I would not want to roll right after? Is this what makes a game hard? Most of the time this mechanic is completely worthless and wastes precious stamina/opportunity for attacks.4. Terrible lock on system. Again, DS1 also had this problem, but I was having a worse time with lock on in this game for some reason. Sometimes, the lock on automatically cancels. Sometimes the enemy has a seizure and the camera is all messed up. Don't even mention the enormous bosses with terrible hit boxes where locking on does not mean you will hit them.5. Sometimes I try using an ember mid fight to heal. I use up the ember but get killed - Ember restored :), you are dead :):) This is the most frustrating mechanic in the entire game. You either take my ember and let me heal, or you take my life. DO NOT TAKE BOTH.Just GIT GUD.",0

Negative,"Console game, very poor using keyboard and mouse, all the tips are for console controls. Unless you have a controller do not buy this.",0
Negative,"Dark Souls is a mixed bag. I love DS lore, I love a hard game. But I need a fair challenge. In DS I'm just fighting the controls more than I'm fighting mobs. Lock on keeps disconnecting, locking to the wrong mobs, has almost no range for locking. The button combination to jump is flawed. Who'd put the jump control on the down press of a joystick that can completely change the angle you're jumping at. This all wouldn't be an issue if the game supported decent keyboard and mouse controls. There are countless 3rd person games that get melee combat right. I'd even be happy with Chivalry style controls. But not being able to strafe without locking on to a target (a function I don't need with mouse controls) and not being able to use my mouse while locked on just makes the control even worse.Then let's talk about the PvP. If you ember in the earlier part of the game be ready to get invaded. By cunts praying on new players. By cunts who cheat praying on new players. This idea of the honorable DS player challenging you to a duel, not consuming estus, not using shitty strats is a farce.I wish DS would shed this rigid idea of the game where you have to play it their way and ""git gud"". I wish I could turn off invasions or make sure invasions are regulated in some sense with a decent cheat protection. To me the largest obstacle to overcome in Dark Souls is Bandai Namco with its head up its ass.",0
Negative,"Would've typed this review earlier if I wasn't busy playing the game itself!This is the first of the Dark Souls games I've played, and I have to say I love it.I heard the game was pretty brutal, and I hadn't really played that many legitimately tough games besides XCOM 2. I was unprepared.The term ""Git gud"" really applies here. Unless you work to better your skills, you aren't going to succeed in this game. I have spent over 90 hours on one character as of me typing this review, and still die quite often due to the purely brutal nature of the game. Leveling up isn't simply a gate to success. You need to learn tactics as well. The visuals are amazing. Sounds are good, music is very well composed. The lore, while hard to understand, is not bad either.I give this game a solid 9/10.UPDATE, 7/6/2021: I can not recommend the game in its current state. The game is still amazing itself. FromSoftware, however, is completely ignoring the glaring exploits within the game's engine. It's recently been brought to their attention that not only can exploiters break players saves, but it is possible to perform remote execution of codes through multiplayer. This is extremely dangerous to users, and FromSoftware should have been on this the moment they were told of it. It has gotten so bad that modders have resorted to making their own anti-cheat systems to protect against this. While the anti cheat systems created by users work for the time being, it is absolutely despicable that a developer would allow such a thing to go on in their game, endangering their playerbase.",0

Obtrusive camera collision detection that leads to constant and nauseating camera distance changes in about half of the major fights, especially noticeable on larger enemies and around anywhere cluttered with objects;and, to a lesser degree:3. Action queue window starts and ends way too late for slow weapons in a counter-intuitive way, but can be mitigated by doing one swing at a time.Game is still fun, but it is hard to recommend it due to the aforementioned problems, unless you really want to experience some dated polishing in a game.",0
Negative,"Let me be the first to admit that I am not very good at this game. I get people love a challenge, and that some people genuinely find these games TOO easy. That said, if you're a new comer to this series, I would not recommend starting with this title. The hit boxes are ridiculously unfair, it's too easy to get stun-locked, and I cannot even begin to describe how many controls, settings, and moves I had to look up online. While I understand this is a good game, and I am just bad at it, I do think that something needs to be said for making the controls clearer, easier to find information would be appreciated, and perhaps some easier to level up areas would help (for people like me that just suck).So, if you're a veteran of this series? I'd say this game is a thumbs up. If you're a newcomer (like me) this game can be great fun at times, but misery incarnate at others.",0
Negative,"pros:- very creative design- interesting bosses with a lot of different stages and forms- good graphicscons:- high amount of hackers- compared to dark souls I or II very repititive in Ng+- absolutly horrible pc version. especially for some amd cards. Just look at all the unsolved threads about lags, fps drops, crashes and network failures- poorly balanced (best example: dark sword or dark hand, 360 parry (not quite sure if that s a bug or just the work of hyper lazy animators)Dark Souls 3 is one of this games that rly makes me sad. It has practicly evrything i like: Stunning locations, thrilling bosses, a intelligent story about what makes mankind human and a creepy, unreal design, weren t there these Pc issues which are way more frustrating for me than the difficulty of the game itself.Overall a wonderful game that reminds me a bit of Batman Arkham Knight. The game itself was realy nice but at the end it failed due to the decision of the producers that it s obviously not necessary nowadays to release games in a playable state because a lot of people will buy it anyway because of pre-orders and bolstered gameplay trailers.",0
Negative,"This game is amazing if you go in blind and on a first playthrough.The story is rich and ambigious, the difficulty is balanced in a way that only a complete nonce would not complete it and overrall, I'd recommend it.For one playthrough.The game offers nothing but the same, linear path towards the same goal. In the past games, you had some sort of decisions as what you should do in some, if not all, parts. Dark Souls III has the same, linear path every playthrough, the only choice the player gets is when you should tackle one of the areas and what one of the mid-game bosses do you want to fight first. Sure, each area has things to explore, but outside of a few scenarios, most of them cryptic, no optional path will lead you to a new sandbox to play in and explore. Even then, most of the optional bosses reach hair-pulling difficulty that barely allow your character to breathe before their next attack (*cough cough* Champion Gundyr *cough cough) And then there's the communityAll of them are cunts. You will never find a single kind Dark Souls III player. The most help you're gonna get is with a boss and even then, the summoned gets a reward for it. The tamest ones are people who place a dickish message ('Hidden Path Ahead' on an obvious drop, 'Illusory Wall Ahead' not on an illusory wall etc). The worst ones will try to fight you. At least in the other games seeing a Pyromancy Flame did not immediatly make me contract terminal cancer. Invaders invade you, whether through their covenant or by choice, point down to signify where you belong and then shit on you. Invading, you will always find a group of 4 people ready to stunlock you, then synchronize their point downs and shits. The only way to avoid these people is to not be embered, but the game punishes you for not being in an embered state by cutting your health to 3/4 of what it was.Overrall Good game Varied environments Intense difficulty Boring post-end content Asshole communityIn conclusion, pick it up once, beat it and then never again",0
Negative,"Wow, that was not enjoyable, it's not DS game it Ambush game with huge health pools. Levels are really bad, it always feels like you are in hallway and never allow in ""house"". Enemies lack of creativity, in most cases they just hit harder and have much more HP to the point of absurd, where you need to hit 3-5 time with BKS normal basic enemy. And that is problem of the entire game, it was made for try hards that cry that DS is to easy and to many people menage to finish it. Now almost every single common enemy have too much health and have some nasty attack that render armor and shield quite useless. Enemies gank you hard because scripts turn them on even when they shouldn't hear or see you. It makes exploration a chore because with so many enemies, with so much hp there is ambush on every corner, you see one enemy, you can be sure there are 3, you see no one, someone probably will spawn or sits on wall or roof waiting to attack it's tiresome.And now bosses, they are 3 types: 1. laughable, 2. kill you instantly 3. bull. using faulty game designs.I will write only about 3rd one, in game where camera works really bad they make bosses that use that against you, bosses act really quick, can jump really high or are really big which brokes camera angle making sometimes impossible to see what's happening and then you get hit in the back. Or you need to fight with weird perspective where you are sure you are close enought but miss and miss again, of course boss have just absurd range so it's not problem for him. Sometimes also they hit you in perfect nanosecond when you get up, making it impossible to react.I have beaten Soul of Cinder but I gave up on Nameless King, camera in the first phase literally doesn't work and second phase is to fast to tank with shield. Plus none of resistance items worked on his attacks so he chipped health with every hit.(full Havel is worthless)",0
Negative,"Going into it, I really wanted to like DS3. But after 30 hours I just lost interest and stopped playing altogether. I didn't make a conscious decision to, I wasn't stuck on a boss or anything, the game just ceased to be compelling for me. I'll list my main criticisms below.1. Boss's are extremely tedious, which is why no one wants to be summoned for them2. Messages don't really have a purpose with the scarcity of mimics, illusory walls and other secrets3. PvP is trivial to ignore altogether and has some weird metagame I can't be bothered to learn4. Exploration is hampered by aggressive enemies and frequent bonfiresI could go on but suffice to say ds3 isn't my cup of tea. It's weird because in a lot of ways dark souls has never been better, but I'd rather sink another 40h into ds2 than finish ds3.",0
Negative,Do i even have to say at this point playing the game is uterlly useless if i cant play online without the fear of being banned.

Negative,most boring piece of shit game ive ever played,0
Negative,"I've played 3 souls games at this point: Bloodborn, Elden Ring and DS3A lot of the problems I have with DS3 are parts of the other games, they are just more numerous feeling in this entry. More instant deaths, more the floor is murder more bosses with grabs and cheap moves, more overpowered enemies that minimize how epic the bosses could feel, more do things because reasons story elements.I have come to call these parts of the game the work of Jon Darksouls and he worked a lot on various parts of this particular game. The poison swam, the death knights, the roundy ball shaped knights are are hard to kill and yield pathetic rewards, you name it and I bet Jon was in charge of it.I played using a co-op mod that makes it so you don't have to be ember'd to make it a bit less of a trial because the High wall starting area is also the hardest starting area in all 3 of those games I mentioned, imo. I find that ironically funny that high wall is a literal tough way to start playing a souls game.Finally the last boss felt really unbalanced and that if you have any build that isn't just a brick wall with a sword, you're out of luck.I've herd good things about the DLC, I hope I can enjoy those more.I'd recommend one of the other games over this one.",0
Negative,"The first playthrough is very fun, OST's are brilliant at the boss fights, however the game becomes really stale at NG+ and after about 5-10 hours in pvp it becomes boring, after the countless disconnections / laggy fights or even getting sent back to your own world the second you've invaded because they've started the boss, it becomes incredibly boring.The covenants in this game are also very bad, 3 of the covenants are auto-invade/summon and they do not work most of the time, you have to be lucky to get summoned or if you didn't level yourself too high so you could pvp you might get lucky, but for those at around SL 80 don't bother with the auto invade/summon covenants, stick with Warriors of Sunlight, Rosaria's Fingers & Mound Makers.also out of the 30ish hours I've played the game, I've only been invaded 4ish times, and I was embered pretty much the whole way through my first run.The game is also very very short compaired to Dark Souls 1 & Dark Souls 2, i'm pretty dissapointed in the game at the moment but hopefully with whatever DLC they bring out it improves the game a lot.",0
Negative,dark souls 2 better,0
Negative,why boss as normal enemy? unkillable?,0
Negative,"This game is really Fun to play, the gameplay and controls are pretty top notch and I defintily wouldn't mind playing more games in this style.That being said I have to vote it down for two major flaws.1. The Co-Op might just be the single worst version of Co-Op I have ever seen in a video game, the fact that you only have a limited number of tries to play with your friend and that if you are playing wth your friend then other people can just attack you and him outright is absurd, I get it the game is supposed to be hard but was it really such a challenge to just put in a 'Invite Friend' option to your game?2. The difficulty, I know, its supposed to be hard and theres nothing wrong with a challenge but this is diffrent.Everything can kill you in 3-4 hits, while blocking you take damage, the stun lock is awful, enemy weapons can clip through object but your weapon bounces off of them ect ect.This isn't real difficulty its artifical diffficulty, the game overpowers ennemies while underpowering you and uses cheap tricks to keep you down and beat you, its a game of trail and error with awful checkpoints to match.All in all the game is really fun to play and satisfying when you actually beat you foe, but all the cheap tricks and the garbage tier Co-Op system hurt this game horribly, I'd say buy it on sale and never over $20 as its not worth full retail price, maybe after I play some more and 'git gud' I'll change that but until then.10/10 a masterpeiceEdit: Turns out I'm just a scrub, the game is pretty damn good probably say its worth $30-$40Co-Op if still kinda shitty most times, mainly the invasions its just really annoying to be doing something and get invaded by some asshat who just tries to lure you towards npcs that don't hurt him.Its not even really fighting all it's just standing around and waiting for someone to make a move and thats boring as all hell.Still a good game but there should be a way to kick invaders from a game or a time limit for invaders so that way your time isn't wasted or even just have the NPC's be able to attack them so its fair (Then again dark souls is the literal form of unfair)11/10 s better masterpieceEdit 2: Can't say you should get this game at anything over $20 and that pushing it, while its fun to play the ammount of times i saw bosses noclip there weapons and bodys through objects so they could do there attacks is staggering.It's hard yes but not because its chalanging its all artifical.Bosses can do just about anything and have no limitsregular NPC's can do the same even hitting you behined a fog wallsometimes the game just Alt TabsLeveling up is actually pointlessand worst of all is the forced PVP the shoehorn into the game so that way you have to do it, don't like it? sucks you get invaded by npc's if your offline tooWan't to play co-op prepare to be invaded all the time.All and all with a little more work this could be a fun challenging game but instead its a glitchy unfair mess and really deserves some blame (don't tell the dark souls fanbase this though, they know its broken and there only response is to 'git gud')-10/10feels like it's still in beta(also as far as I know you can't even use mods offline otherwise you get banned online, i'd test it myself but this company has an itchy trigger finger and saying this in a review will probably get me banned.drop it to -11/10 for lack of mods)Also recently fought a bird boss and not only does the camera freak out in that area the lock on just does not work 9.9/10 making it hard to see or keep track of a flying enemynot only that but this boss likes to phase through your attacks as well to top it all off.in case that wasn't even close to enough getting to that boss is a pain since enemies will just block the door way with there body and if you try and fight your way there you'll have an awful time (or rather a more awful time)Update: Played some more and this game is still trash, combat is good but everything else is just a steaming turd-131/10 game gets steadly worse the longer I play (and this comment remains true)",0

Negative,"This game isn't Dark Souls. Invasions have always been part of the game, but the way they have things set up in DS3, you can run ahead in the game, remain low level, and then invade starting areas and just spam heal against new players. I have been unable to progress not because I'm not better than these people, but because they can dodge roll twice and heal instantly basically forever while I am stuck with 3 estus flasks of the lowest quality. Time and time again I'll have these losers down to their last hit or 2, and they'll roll off and instantly heal. Meanwhile, stuck with my very limited healing, I have no choice but to dodge, block, parry and fight like a mad bastard. Sometimes I even win. But the balance is so far broken its not a question of me being better, but them simply being unable to roll far enough away.Honestly, if I could get my money back for this game I would, this game simply isn't Dark Souls. Its a broken troll fest mess.",0
Negative,"Game's a bad meme.At this point the only people playing this are either newbies, or tryhards who only use the latest meta. PvP is pretty messy and incredibly laggy, though that could most likely be because Australian Internet is pretty garbage, so.From a PvP Standpoint, I dare say this is the worst in the series. I don't know why FROM decided this, but invasion priority goes to hosts with a phantom (or 2), while you get stuck solo. It's just insane. Phantom Range is rampant in this game, you can roll twice but still get hit and the Straight Sword is still king. Fast attack, wide swing, and more range than an ultra greatsword make them stupidly overpowered/PvP Meta. I'd prefer the old Carthus Curved sword meta over this current patch anyday.",0

There is no native support for Ultrawidescreen, so I have to learn how to use HxD to code it in there myself, so the game doesnt look like stretched pixel vomit. Alright, that was a dumpster fire, but after a while I even managed to get that working.Already frustrated, but happy that it FINALLY works I start the game, press X and. wait. I press X and nothing happens? Phenomenal, my controller isnt recognized either! So I tried everything. Deactivate Steam Input, activate it again, set it to default, use my PS5 controller wired, try it wireless, give up on the PS5 controller, thinking its just too new for this game, repeat all of the steps with a PS4 controller, nothing works, ragequit and write salty article on the steam forum.Every Indie Dev in the world manages to have Steam Input do the work for them and have every controller work natively.

Negative,"Honestly? As much as people love to hate on Dark Souls 2, 3 has to take the spot as worst in the series for me. Without the DLC I felt like I was playing an unwanted remake of Dark Souls 1, but without the freedom and fun of Dark Souls 1, this game is a huge, slow and dragged railroad and that really kills the replay value for me. The DLC added some spice to it and gave the the Trilogy an interesting ending as well as some nice bosses (not the most fun areas tho), but the base game is awful. Go play Scholar or Dark Souls Remastered, they do anything Dark Souls 3 tried to do but better in plenty of ways, and if you like weapon arts just go play Elden Ring, they are much better there.",0
Negative,"Took me a while to understand why i didn't like this game. The answer is simple : its not dark souls.The game is name dark souls and is in the lore of dark souls but the gameplay isn't there. In fact this game is Bloodborne 2. So where to start:1- Most boss are crap because they are bloodborne boss in a dark souls game. That maens: fast and endless spree of attack and unpredictable OR spamming magic and poor fight design like Aldrich. The only bosses fight i have enjoy is the dragon slayer armor, Lothric and Soul of Cinder.That's 3 on 19. Oh yeah i forget to say this one has the least bosses.2- Boss can hit you when you're on the ground, but compare to dark souls 1 you take full damage instead of 1/4.3- The ash flask is crap.4- the difficulty curve is stupid, you start killing scrubs and then a black mass appear and reck your ass. Dark souls always and a fair difficulty curve base on the souls you should have accumulate and your perception.5- Jailer in the Irithyll dongeons are stupid, they drain your max hp, who the fuck though it was a good enemie type.skeleton wheel were a good challenge, you could do something against them with skills. Dark Souls is about skills not button mashing and haste.6- shields are almost useless against boss because most of them do elemental damage or just go through your shield. the only time i use shield now is for parrying. its should not be like that,7- Now we have to talk about dodge, WTF. they don't take enough stamina, so you just start spamming it and never use shields. THIS IS NOT BLOODBORNE, A DODGE IS SUPPOSED TO BE TIMED NOT SPAMMED.8- POISE? where is it? oh i know, this game is bloodborne so they didn't implemented it.9- PvP sucks because of dodge stamina cost10- The map in dark souls 2 was fuck up, but at least it was not has linear has this one.Dark souls 2 was better since it respected what dark souls really is. You don't change the gameplay when you make sequels, you add CONTENT and FEATURES.That season pass better be worth it, you had my thrust Miyazaki now you lost it i wont ever pre-order another Dark Souls.",0
Negative,"If you like your games to show up at your house unannounced, tie you up, beat you relentlessly, steal all the beer out of your fridge, then leave you in a heap on the ground then you will adore this game. I for one am not really interested in this kind of experience. When I was younger I would have been totally into this but for me at this time I'm not into games that stress me out like this one does. Many people really like this series so it's not like it a bad game per se. I just can't recommend anyone looking to escape into a game put themselves through this unless you know what your getting into. This was the first time I tried a dark souls game it it literally plops you down with absolutely no explanation to wander off to god knows where to get slaughtered over and over again by whatever kind of eldritch horror the psychos that designed this thing dreamed up. It just not the game for everyone. As soon as I realized that I wasn't really having any fun I refunded it. Games should be fun. and this game was not fun for me. Your mileage may vary. Maybe you hate yourself and you love having your entire psyche torn apart and remade by FromSoftware's sadistic game design philosophy. Idk man. more power to you I guess. I also found that the community around the series seems to be full of a lot of ""git gud"" style machismo types. That is why I enabled comments on this review as I thought that may be fun for everyone.",0
Negative,"If you're looking for a standard co-op experience, do not look here.While the game overall is fun and a great Dark Souls experience, it does not allow for a standard co-op experience that you'd expect to find in most games, instead creating frustrating interruptions to gameplay that have no workaround. DS3 has a player invasion system where hostile players can invade and kill you every 15 minutes, leading to interruptions to co-op play. The problem is not just that fighting other players is difficult - it's not really about ""getting good"" at the game: it's that if you want to have the experience you love of playing Dark Souls, but with a friend, the joy of the game is constantly frustrated by invading interruptions.Although the internet says it matches lower-level invaders to your game, that was not my experience. With fewer than 10hrs in the game, and with a friend who had created a new character, we had players whose weapons took all my HP in 2 hits. This is incredibly frustrating, because to start co-op mode, you need a hard-to-get resource (that's technically infinite, but not trivially attainable), and co-op mode must be restarted each time the host's character dies. Furthermore, in co-op, the chances for invasion are greatly increased-co-op players are put to the top of the invasion queue, and if even they defeat the hostile, they can be invaded at most once every 15 minutes. Because of how often invasion is opened, you have a high chance of being invaded by players who are more skilled than you, both being killed, and being forced to re-start co-op.There is not a way to get around the invasion system. There is no setting to stop it. There are no mods to prevent it, and even if there were, any modifications to the game's files result in a ban when connecting to DS3's servers. You cannot use a VPN or LAN to escape it, because you have to connect to the game's servers to start co-op. This game is years old, so it's unlikely the devs would change this.If you are looking for singleplayer Dark Souls, this is a great game for you. If you are a DS expert and can kill many other PvP players, co op could be fun to change up the gameplay. If you are looking to play with a friend for more than 15-30min at a time to go through the DS experience together, look for a game that doesn't discourage you from playing its features.",0

Negative,"Is DS3 a bad game? No.Is it the best thing ever? No.Did I have fun? Somewhat.Would I recommend it to anyone? No.I think DS3 has pretty good combat but the overall experience becomes too exhausting after a while. Bad camera and unclear hitboxes could gang up on you while you're fighting bosses that hit like a truck, worsening the already narrow margin of error. The reward you gain from boss fights aren't really worth it. While the art direction is strong and the music is excellent, the story is told in an incoherent manner through a bunch of mumbling goth kid NPCs. And your character has no character. So, I didn't feel engaged to this drab world. Yeah, yeah, there's some ash lords doing something bad. Whatever. The game is solid but overrated.If you're interested, wait for a deep discount.

Numerous manual hotfixes and hacks online to address these but no official handling for them. Finished the game and it's overall great, but this is the 3rd FromSoftware game with a bad PC port.",0
Negative,"By far the worst game in the franchise. Dumbed down in every aspect, and way more restrictive than any previous souls game. Because the world structure is incredibly linear, it results in way less variety in repeated playthroughs, which makes replaying the game tedious and boring. You always have to go through the same places in the same order on each repeated playthrough until around half point in the game, and even then it doesn't improve all that much. It also hurts build variety, since you can't get certain items earlier because the game structure just won't allow it. The levels themselves are way more linear than ever before too. Combat, while faster, is heavily dumbed down. Absolutely broken poise makes every melee build feel the same unless you're using ranged magic, which you probably wouldn't want to do anyway, since it's practically useless in this game, especially when it comes to miracles. It is the third game in the series, but still has issues from previous titles that were made with way lesser budget. The game still doesn't have cloud saving or even keyboard icons for PC users, for example. Anti-cheat is way worse than it was in Dark Souls 2, literally their previous game. People can break your save files by invading you, send you to ng+, or put broken items in your inventory which will ban you from playing online. Similar things could happen in the first game too, but that game didn't even have any anti-cheat solution to begin with, and was made with a much smaller budget.The game borrows way too much from Dark Souls 1, to the point where it doesn't even feel like a homage anymore, but straight up self-copying and laziness. Half of the characters in DS3 are literally the same people that you meet in DS1, except names might be different this time around.PVP is the worst series had so far. Fun mechanics like kamikaze jumps or magic sniping were removed from the game for no reason, and matchmaking prioritizes invasion to people who have a whole squad of phantoms with them. To add insult to injury you are required to invade A LOT if you want to obtain certain items, spells, or achievements since you need covenant items to get them. In previous games, you could easily farm those items from regular enemies, and well, you can do that here too, except there's a catch. The drop rate for covenant items in DS3 is insanely low. We're talking less than a 4% chance of item drop here. Farming two silver knights in Anor Londo has become a meme at this point, due to how ridiculously long it takes to get items you need (it may take up to 8-12 hours of mindless grinding of the same two enemies), which forces you to either PVP (which isn't fun due to the restrictive nature of the game) or ask somebody to help you with getting these items by invading each other. It honestly hurts to see the game the way it is, because I'm a huge fan of the series and wanted it to be good more than anyone else, but sadly it's far from being a good souls game for me. It's not all awful though. The music is the best in the series, and visually the game looks pretty. Lore is okay too, but that's about it. Huge disappointment.",0

It's also difficult from the beginning and somewhat uninspiring when it comes to sticking with it. I had high hopes for this game but it can't see the appeal sadly. The intro was OK and the tutorial was OK. I would recommend HellBlade instead as that has what I was expecting from this title.",0
Negative,"The From Software team is nothing short of unparalleled genius. As someone who's played the first two games, you have to wonder how they could make this game even more difficult for more veteran players. Most people tend to think ""smarter AI"" or ""unpredictable bosses,"" but From really threw a curveball on this one. I would have never expected that they would implement constant game crashes & frame drops. These new features have ramped the difficulty so much that I struggle to make it past the first bonfire! They even made getting into the game difficult, with having to disable all other controllers on your PC just to get yours to work! Truely, I believe this is the level of difficulty that every Souls fan has been craving since the original. I tip my hat to you, From Software.In all seriousness, there's an amazing game in here, but an unbelievably bad port has left a sour taste in my mouth. Lets hope for DSfix in the meantime.",0

Negative,"Finally finished it after several attempts over the years it has been released. I cannot STATE how much I hate the combat in this game. It essentially kills the essence of the franchise for me, PvP and invading. If you particularly enjoyed the DS2 combat you'll maybe have a hard time getting into this. Otherwise a pretty good game when it comes to quality, as its common with Fromsoft.",0
Negative,"Prepare to die. All Dark Souls reviews have to start with that. This game is worse than Dark Souls 2, which is a controversial opinion. It has a lot of problems that hold it back from being a good game. The graphics are really good. there are some amazing songs in this game, and the sound effects are nice. Some of the bossfights are really amazing and the phases are a nice touch, yet a little overdone. Too much of a good thing can be bad. The game doesn't run as well as Dark Souls 2: Scholar of the First Sin. A PC that can run SotFS at 60 fps on max settings can only get about 40 fps on Dark Souls 3 at lowest settings. The gameplay starts out really fun, but the longer you play, the more you notice things. They removed spell uses from the game, and instead tied spell uses to a mana bar called Focus Points. This wouldn't be so bad, but the way you refill your FP is by drinking Ashen Estus. Ashen Estus are clumsy, they cut in to your standard healing Estus Flasks. You can allocate how many of each estus you have, and getting more Estus only gives ONE Estus, instead of one of each. This wouldn't be a problem if being a phantom didn't only give you half of your Estus, on top of having 30% less max health. The new Hollowing mechanic, is an item called an Ember, that increases your max health by 30% and allow you to summon or be invaded. This is so bad, if you want to survive better, you have to risk being invaded even if you don't want help, which is even worse because Dark Souls 3 has the lowest end game health pools out of any Souls game, and the way defense works the difference between the lightest armor and heaviest armor is 1 extra hit. If you are a white phantom co-oping with a buddy, these things are awful. You have 30% lower health than you'd like, no real defense, AND you have less estus. Being an invader is also awful, you still have the lower health, half Estus, and no real defense. But this time, the matchmaking prioritizes people that are co-oping, so it's you against 2 or more players while everyone can use their Estus. Matchmaking is at least based on level again instead of Soul Memory. The level design is quite nice for the most part, a lot of areas that circle back on themselves and have unlockable shortcuts, but the world design is bad in the sense that it is the most linear Dark Souls game to date in terms of which areas you can go to in order. The enemies are a lot faster and more aggressive this time around, which is a bit clumsy with the kind of game Dark Souls is. They basically took enemy design from Bloodborne and thought it would work in Dark Souls, without thinking about WHY it works. The rally mechanic made it so you could afford to be aggressive, because you could get your health back from it, instead of backing off. the rally mechanic is not in this game, you basically have to stick it out the whole time or try to find a time to heal, which is dangerous considering the attacks all have sweeping hitboxes and slow wind ups meant to make you panic and to catch you at the end of your roll. The gameplay is very fast for a Souls game, which includes how fast you heal, which only makes PvP more annoying. Dodging takes next to no stamina. You could only have enough stamina to swing an ultra greatsword 4 times in a row, but you can dodge about 12 times in a row with that much stamina, and no punishment for doing so. Weapon Arts were a mechanic added in this game. They were poorly implimented. Every weapon has a special move that USUALLY costs Focus Points, but you can only use them by 2 handing the weapon, having nothing in your off hand, or by using a shield that lets you use the arts one handed. All of these ways prevent you from parrying. Poise, which is your stagger resistance stat, has been changed. Poise is now only active during certain attack animations of certain weapons. They added a type of weapon infusion called Refined, which lowers the base damage but increase the bonus damage tied to your physical stats to be equal to each other. This is the way to get the most damage out of most weapons in the game. Power stancing is gone, now the only way to effectively dual wield is to use special paired weapons. Dark Souls can never get their stats right, this game included. Dexterity, which is a physical damage stat, also increases your magic casting speed, instead of any stat relating to magic. Luck has a very selective use, it helps status and item drop rates. Faith increases your lightning damage and allows you to use lightning magic, but your lightning defense is tied to the stamina stat. Dark Souls 3 rehashes too much. There are a lot of throwbacks and references, but some of these just don't make sense or not as interesting as something new. Dark Souls 3 is not a bad game, just mediocre. It's fun at first but grates on you after a while. There are a ton of small things that seem minor but start to build up and get on your nerves. It tries to be everything that people enjoy about the Souls series, without understanding WHY they were great, and felt like it tried to forget Dark Souls 2 existed. In the end, it just feels like the clumsy child of Dark Souls and Bloodborne.",0
Negative,"I want to recommend this game, but by all that it does right. i can't. Why? Well because From Software is absolutly unable to create a working Anti-Cheat system. They warm up the coop ever time, make it a bit more stable, better connections and then.the fuck the players with the anti-cheat software! Like they would not give a shit about the community?!So unless they fix this (i doubt they will) i can't recommend this game. Sure if you don't care bout online and online play alone offline, well then buy it. The game itself has some flaws, but is still worth the money. But if you want to Coop and PVP, well good luck to you. You can get banned for nothing. A cheater in your game as a invader or even as a helping phantom can mean the end to your online experience! Plain and simple. Even if you would delete all your saves and reinstall the game, you still get the same shity message and soon after you will be penalized!So sad, i hope they fix it somehow and i can change this review.",0
Negative,"This game is very depressing, will hollow your spirit and make you want to quit playing all other games as well. This game is not for entertainment nor to make you feel better.1. You will get lost all the time: there is no in-game maps and all critical progress points are very well hidden. Very depressing2. The world is hollow and all enemy NPC are mute, no interactions, and depressing. They are not excitingly scary like other games. Just depressing NPCs.3. If you die you will loose all credits (souls) and must fight through the hell to get your credits back. Imagine if it stuck at an odd place or you cannot find it. Very depressing. And you will die a lot. 4. There is no in-game quest logs, so use pen and pencil to write them down so you can remember next time you login. Very depressing to just think about it.5. Your character scales mainly based on how you roll, block, or parry, not much by items, make you stressed and depressed for casual play. Items matter less. Not much of role playing, more like a ping-pong arcade game.",0

R ? right next to the E key that you must press all the time. there`s no game in the universe with R as the potion key. ``i`` dosnt even pop u the inventory. i wonder what it was. maybe ALT and then to access it F4, both at the same time .

Negative,"I absolutely love the soul series and have long awaited to get my hands on DS3 but this so far has been nothing but a horrible experience so far.

I love the co-op feature of the DS series and it's a big part of the game for me. I've played other online games and have no connectivity issues my end, just seems to be with DS3. (When I get kicked from the game due to connectivity, I'm still connected to the internet).Has anyone else had this issue? Or any fixes?

Negative,"If you didn't like DS2 or the direction it was pushing the series, then you probably won't like this game much since it is like DS2, but functional, a bit more fun with more options available, and with more roots in the DS1 lore. I say this because while playing through DS2 and DS3, I saw a strong leaning toward artificial difficulty, meaning that random BS would kill unsuspecting players around almost every corner (it's not a funny surprise anymore when the third room in the same building has yet another enemy waiting on the left or right of the door), lots of enemies in a group, each with insane attack combos that can nearly instagib you while also sometimes being damage sponges, etc.I think a solid way to illustrate this is just the amount of mimics in this game compared to prior ones. In DS1 the first mimic you find is in Sen's Fortress, which is after you've beaten a few bosses and opened a few chests, that makes the discovery that this one chest is actually a monster a funny and shocking moment for the player that stays with them through the rest of the game. in DS3 there's a mimic in the very first area that you'll probably stumble upon within your first few runs into said area. Then later you meet another, and another, and another, with two even being a stone's throw from each other in the dungeons. Granted I never fell for any of them, but it was worrying to me when a fun and surprising part of the first game suddenly became so commonplace to the point where it was just an annoying nuisance. Now take what I said about mimics going from something unique, cool, and dangerous to something just annoying that feels like a ""gotcha"" moment, and apply it to groups of enemies, some bosses (though some are legit fun), some areas, and you'll see what I mean. I've 100%ed DS1 so I don't think it's a skill/perseverance issue, I just don't feel motivation to beat a game that throws needless junk at the player just because ""it's a dark souls game so that means you have to die a lot, even if it's from random bs"".I looked forward to this game for a long time but was unable to play it until recently since my old PC couldn't run it. Although im sure it's fun for a lot of people, It's too much like DS2 and not enough like DS1 for me to enjoy it, if you're like me then you'll probably agree after a few hours",0
Negative,"Game as a game is pretty good, in terms of mechanics and such, Some enemies are quite simply disgusting to look at just based on what they are, so if you dislike bugs and creepy crawlies its bad, Multiplayer in the game is an absolute joke, you can summon other players to help you and do co-op stuff if you are embered, however you can also be invaded when embered, About 89 % of invaders are the worst people you have ever met, Most wear very meta armor and weapons, and they like to invade the starting area with endgame characters, In addition to this, you are unable to leave the area until the invader is dealt with, and they will very often run and hide for the sole purpose of ruining your day. In addition to this Hackers like to invade and put hacked items that you can't remove into your game, just by existing, and the company bans people for this and blames players for getting hacked by other players. The game in and of itself, not bad, But multiplayer is quite poor in its execution, and quite simply, the company has utterly failed to stop hackers at any point.",0

Negative,"Fun is subjective, but I don't think my complaints are.So many of the enemies in this game are not worth fighting. This is a souls game, so you weigh how challenging the enemy is vs how many souls you get from it. That ratio is very bad in this game, however you can just run by/through most threats. That is not a fun way to play the game - for most people.In a souls game, the precedent they have set is: Bosses thrash you a couple times and you overcome them, the levels in between have sneaky bullshit that usually only works once. BUT, it's your opportunity to just beat down on some lil guys and get a little stronger while doing it as well as exploring the super cool and depressing world.In Dark Souls 3, the levels are stressful nonsense and the boss fights aren't much better. Many of the bosses have a gimmick or trick and once you learn that you can usually beat them pretty easily. Ideally, the boss is tough but fair and I persevere because I get better, not because I've memorized this boss's specific attack pattern that doesn't help me at all throughout the rest of the playthrough.Some other complaints:-Shields don't feel very effective as shields. Sure get their buff, but unless you're running a shield that absorbs a lot of damage, it will just give you a false sense of security. Many monsters have multi hit combos that just empty your stamina bar and leave you vulnerable, and that's just one monster, if there are multiple you're just boned. Rolling is king in DS3.-NPCs, not necessary for a normal playthrough for beating the game. However, some builds hinge on when you interact with them in the world. As you may recall, it's not fun to explore Dark Souls 3. There is a point of no return for some NPCs that become vendors that may make or break a build. You don't know what you're gonna find fun as a playstyle, but they do let you respec. However, point of no return. It's irksome at best.-Armor, what does it do? You can't buff it or upgrade it, you just get new armor. It can't be too heavy though else you lose the good roll. You could upgrade vitality, but that's a stupid stat, you want more damage or HP or endurance. It also doesn't help much in boss fights, Vigor/HP is a better investment. It does help against the mobs between bosses, unless you get combo'd or get ganged up on. Armor isn't satisfying.Edit: Poison Arrows are also trash. They were so much fun in 2 and helped with removing annoying enemies particularly casters. In DS3, anything you would want to use them against is likely immune or highly resistant against poison. Your best bet is to just run some upgraded bow and go for raw damage, more efficient.Really the presentation is very good. It's a good looking game that moves and handles really well. The content is lacking in most other areas.",0

It prides itself on making you feel bad by punishing you for its own clunky controls, and then encourages the rest of the playerbase to make your time less enjoyable.

Negative,"Dark Souls is made for a very particular audience that I am not a member of. The game is excellent if you fall within the group of people that enjoy punishing games that you have to learn to beat through repetition. Personally, I come to games for interesting stories set in fantastical worlds. I'm not really interested in perfecting the skill of fighting in these kinds of games just for the sake of finishing the game. Dark Souls has an incredible world, but apparently you're going to have to sit and read the description of every item you find if you want to actually get a story, because DS doesn't really tell you one through gameplay. If you don't specifically seek out the story, it will just be a bunch of bosses interspersed with lower level enemies. They'll look incredible, but you'll have no idea why they exist or why they are important at all. The combat also uses input queuing, and you cannot interrupt animations at all. So if you start swinging your sword and see a monster attacking, you're screwed even if you could have reacted fast enough to dodge.If you're not a Dark Souls kinda person, this game has a great world but the experience of playing it is awful.",0
Negative,"Do NOT buy if you don't own an Xbox controller.As funny as it sounds, this PC GAME requires an XBOX controller to play. Trying to play on mouse and keyboard adds that much more difficulty to an already difficult game. All menu items are indicated using Xbox symbols. While playing the game, it'll ask you to press 'A' to interact. That means you'll have to press ESC and find the keybind that correlates to the 'A' button on the Xbox controller. Could they not just put the actual keybind on the interact symbol rather than having to match-up every 2 seconds?It doesn't make much sense to me - this is the equivalent of releasing on PS4 while using Xbox symbols on interact/combat tooltips. The only reason this game has a positive rating is because the actual game is good. It's NOT good on PC.Again, do not buy if you do not own an Xbox controller.",0
Negative,"Disclaimer - This review is for the Multiplayer/PVP/Co-op Aspect of Dark Souls 3This is not a review of the main game as a whole as I would give that a recommended thumbs up.This thumbs down is for the Online PVP part as for April 19, 2016's build.Please read the entire thing to get a full understanding of where I'm coming from with this.I'm putting this review here as posting on the Discussion would most likely just get lost after mere minutes with how fast the board moves.-So to start off I'm not going to say the online is broken. It's not trash.It's unpolished.It has the potential using the foundations built from DS1 and DS2 to be good, but there are too many ""little things"" that add together to make the overall experience not very enjoyable at times to downright rage-inducing.The problem comes with the fact that the Host player when it comes to invasions has too much advantage among other thingsHost Advantage as people put it though the definition of what it implies changes from game to game.(Example - Host Advantage in Gears of War was the host having the best connection thus certain actions are quicker for them. If they shot an enemy at the same time the enemy shot them, their shot would register first, etc)In Dark Souls 3, the host has an arsenel of tricks they can use and it can become downright cheap where the odds lean so much in their favor they are guaranteed to win.The first main one is Password summoning.A host can summon a player regardless of level, NG cycle, and everything if they use a password. The game will summon them, and will downscale them in terms of damage dealt and damage recieved.This occurs a lot in low level areas (Example - Cruxifiction Woods) and while it does downscale a few aspects of them, it does not downscale anything else.These End Game summons will still be using their endgame gear, endgame weapons, endgame rings, and weild endgame miracles and spells. Thus having low level players wearing basic gear like Exile's armor and the Ice sword, fighting players in full Havel's armor, being able to dodge roll, and using a sword that can literally crack lightning down on the enemy player while being completely invisible and using +10 Estus Flasks with 7 chugs and healing miracles while the invader around this area will have a +3 Estus with 3 chugs.The host will have two of these decked out guys most likely, and you trying to fight them would be darn near impossible becauuseee.If you do manage to kill a summon, the host can then immediatly resummon them.And then the resummoned NPC will have full estus and it will begin again.Through experience I've encountered a few groups like this, preying on low level invaders who stand slim chance of even managing to kill one of these, and they will resummon over and over because there is no cool-down or limitations for it.And then, if by some chance you manage to kill both summons and are attacking the host, the host WILL disconnect, thus taking away victory.Course each time they kill someone, they get more Estus drinks thus allowing them to continue for even longer. (The extra drinks from kills is something I do not understand why they added. I'm assuming Bloodborne had something to do with it)So unlike DS1 and DS2, gankers become much more common now.But then let's talk about the Invader Factions.Invaders in Dark Souls 3 includeRosaria FingersMound MakersWolves of FaronAldrich's FaithfulIn games you can have up to 3 invaders depending on how many summons you got and so on, but the problem is. coupled with what I spoke of earlier, invaders also have to worry about each other.The host and his phantoms can communicate via mic chat, and don't damage each other.Invaders, even if they're in the same faction (Not counting Faron and Faithful) CAN damage each other, target each other and even kill each other.Rosaria Finger's gain no benefits from doing this, yet they still can kill each other.Mound Makers make a bit more sense in this department as any kill adds to their kill count and thus can add to victory.But here's the part that to me, makes zero sense.Multiple Wolves of Faron can invade a host. They are put into a party, shown as being on the same team, and can't damage each other.Yet they can not use Mic Chat.This, made zero sense to me as it feels like the Farron guys and Aldrich guys, being in the same party, would then be able to communicate and coordinate with their fellow covenent folks.Potentially overpowered summons with a massive pool of healing potential coupled with quick resummoning coupled with the fact groups of invaders can not coordinate an attack on a group of players since they have no way to communicate and their own attacks will be killing each other in battles as well as among the fact as well that the host can just easilly hit Alt-F4 and take victory when you're close to it makes invading not really fun at times despite it being a key aspect of the Dark Souls Franchise.To make matters worst, there is a growing number of save editors appearing in game that make victory impossible and thus all you can do is just black crystal out and try again.Even more, ingame there is an item called the ""Knight's Roster"" that serves the same functionality as the book of the guilty from Dark Souls 1, except shows contribution of Darkmoon players, that shows tons and tons of save edited characters with ingame links to their steam profile pages available on demand.Yet From Software and Valve do not seem to be doing anything about it.-Overall, a few tweaks here and there could be made to make the online portion much more enjoyable for everyone, and here are just some ideas I've been thinking over.Now these are just my ideas and my opinion.First. I feel as if there should be ""summon slots"" for summoned phantoms. You have two slots, and if you use the cracked fingers you get a third otherwise you just have two.If a phantom occupying a slot dies, that slot gets a cool-down before another phantom can be summoned to occupy it.The time for the cooldown I am not sure what it should be, as too little would be redundent, but too much would mean the host has to escape an invader and chaos for who knows how long and that can feel like an eternity.I do feel however, even if all the slots have cool-downs, Blue Phantoms can still join and assist the host.This would give Blue Phantoms more to do as I've noticed a lot of people saying Blue Invasions are far and few between and I personally have noticed for some reason blue phantoms get summoned in the moment the host DIES. I have seen this happen after I've killed a host at least 6 times, and I've had the host be dead upon arrival as a blue phantom more often then being alive.I personally think the Blue Phantoms are an enjoyable covenent and one of the more fun and blood pumping groups as they finally get their time to shine after the horror they had to go through in Dark Souls 2.The other thing is, many games can detect if the opponent has disconnected.I feel as if the host disconnects it should be counted as a forfeit and automatically give any invaders the victory.The host lives sure, but the invader would still get their covenent item.Or possibly. perhaps given an item unique to disconnections.Red Phantoms get Split-tongues by killing Blue Phantoms for example, so I feel like if a host disconnects, the invader should get an item that acts like a token to turn into your covenent, but can be turned into ANY covenent and count as one. However it would not count as a Contribution to the Darkmoon Covenent book, etc.Lastly, I feel as if the Farron Wolves and Alrich Faithful should be allowed mic chat if multiple are in one area.This has just been my 2 cents on Dark Souls's PVP.It's ""okay"", but it CAN get polished up a bit more.",0

Negative,"I think this video is a very good review of the game and it also mirrors the majority of my gripes with the game. Also: I think the game tries too hard to be a ""Best Of Soulsgames"" and often lacks its own specific identity.The game is still quite good if you like the soulsborne genre, but I think that DS3 is the weakest entry to the series. DS3 heavily resuses bosses and themes from previous games that people liked (Bloodborne, DS1) and most of the time you can instantly see the inspiration as soon as you encounter a new area. The final boss is literally and amalgamation of all previous players so literally a ""Best of Souls""-embodiment. It s a shame that the game hasn t taken more inspiration from DS2.I loved Powerstancing and Bonfire Ascetics. DS2 actually changed NG+. Also, DS2 runs at a crisp 60fps at all times while DS3 is much, much worse in that regard. Also, this game is too much bloodborne and not enough souls. Often bosses are straight out of Bloodborne, they move very fast and have unlimited stamina while you are confined to a slower pace that is more soulslike and combat is often frustrating because of that. these are a good writeups of this gripe: https://steamcommunity.com/app/374320/discussions/0/365163686085640733/https://www.reddit.com/r/darksouls3/comments/4hc01j/dark_souls_3_spammy_enemies_and_how_it_ruined_the/https://www.reddit.com/r/darksouls3/comments/4h3rk7/i_love_dsiii_but_i_feel_like_the_enemies_are/A lot of visual influences are taken straight from Bloodborne because people loved Bloodborne, but Dark Souls 3 is worse for it because it often feels like it tries to emulate what made Bloodborne so good without trying be its own thing. The DLC, on the other hand, is stellar. It is worth playing through the main game just to play the DLC.",0

Negative,"Dark Rolls 3.The whole game engine is a asinine unbalanced mess. Iframes, hyperarmor, invulnerability animations. These are the headshaking concepts that you will have to wrap your head around to understand this games defense system. Its like they set out to build a game around a bad engine instead of building the engine around the concept of the game.To simplify you find out that armor does not act like armor and is mostly a waste to invest in, your invulnerable to attack when you roll even if blades are going right though your character, even the largest blades (yeah real hardcore right there) and most boss fights devolve into you rolling around like a tard and getting hits in when they are at the end of their animations.I do not see the appeal of this game at all. When I first picked this up I figured it would be a very hardcore game where armor acted like armor and was built around a solid base of down to earth concepts on fighting and combat. No no no its probably the biggest mess of abstract ideas I have ever seen. Most PVP fights are just people rolling around and chugging flasks, with some parrying while invulnerable thrown in. How is that real? How is that hardcore? Its like someone set out to build the most complex and yet ass-backwards combat engine possible.Basically to be good at this game is far less about skill and far more about knowing the inner brokenness of the game engine its built on and the laziness of the developers. rolling your massive body with giant sword 2+meters takes less stamina then blocking a attack from a similar sized opponent with a shield as tall as a man. you can roll faster then a man can run, and can actually lose less stamina rolling then you can chasing the guy rolling away. its just silly. I could go on and on about the little messed up things this game does in combat that make little to no sense for a world set in medieval warfare I see 2 large armies fighting against each other by rolling around right through sword blades and taking no damage. From the reading I have done apparently little has changed in its combat since dark souls 1. So what I'm being told is that this game has improved in no way since the original? They did not update their games core concept with a better engine or new technology? Wow that's COD levels of stupid.Sorry to hate on your game I know a lot of people love this thing, but I don't see myself playing a new game + or putting any more time into this game, its just not worthwhile. I would not recommend it to someone else not because of any difficulty of the game but because its convoluted combat system makes no practical sense and is such a waste of what is a beautiful world and game.",0
Negative,"TLDR: 6/10, needs a hell of a lot of bug-fixes, Praise the Sun! Sound: 9/10 Estus Graphics: 8/10, if only i could be so grossly incandescent. Controls: 8/10, poise is important! Gameplay: 0/10, shame on you FromSoftware, your game sucks until its bugs get fixed!Well, this game basically sucks pretty damn hard right now.besides looking pretty good, it has several other sweet features, like crashing about every 10-15minutes, dropping its framerate every now and then, aswell as dogs that jump through walls, pvp versus invincible dudes (they dont move, they dont take damage, you just fight them like 5 minutes and then suddenly take 1 hit that immediately kills you), etc.At least it is really difficult, it is way harder than DS1 and 2, but the way it ramps up its difficulty is somewhat questionable, i played the knight, the pyro and the sorcerer and found that the >first boss< was by far stronger than the 2nd one, but thats kinda fine, if everyone who bought the game right away is an experienced souls player.Beginners might love the Knight, because he's somewhat op right away, but other classes, like the sorcerer or thief, well they just suck for quiet a while, until you leveled up a bit.The Bosses on the other hand, have a quiet nice design, all of the feel different and are challanging, but not unbeatable.For the Lore you ask? Well, the story i've experienced so far was told in a really straight-forward way, NPCs tell you what might await you in your near future and almost every new enemy-type is first presented in a one on one kind of scenario.By the way, this games music is just . gorgeous. even if its rather quiet most of the time, the 2nd Boss for example has some epic choirs singing in the background. i luv it!",0

Negative,"TBH, Dark Souls 3 has lots of problems: you can be trapped by curdely made setting details such as the projection of a wall; your enemies don't really hurt their friends or have their big weapons bounced back while swinging it to a wall. I do not intend to list all of the problems out but i do want to say that many of the problems existed in the previous(including BLOODBORNE)games and should be fixed already. I know that many of the players, good or bad, take problems like that as something normal, which is not at all. As a indirect result, game makers stopped correcting their wrongs. I think a hardcore game should really have hardcore, strict, detailed settings that can be fair for both the players and the enemies. This might sounds bad but Dsouls 3 is fucked up since the makers thought hardcore games are all about a lot of traps and badass enemies instead of forcing players to play not only carefully but also tactically.PS:King of Storms is one of the worst bosses ever, the boss fight is really boring and meaninglessly dilatory6/10",0

Negative,"*Update March 2020!*In addition to everything bad I've had to say already, erroneous account penalties and false-flagging continues to run out of control. If you, for any reason, lose internet connection during an online session and attempt to log back into the server, DS3's anti-cheat software will flag your account as having ""hacked data"" and permanently quarantine you from online play. There is no fix for this, no reliable workaround (using family sharing will risk getting the account you share to banned as well), and Bandai refuses to address the issue. Bandai has made sure that even attempting to enjoy the game as a multiplayer experience is a frustrating and disappointing experience.This is a pretty unfortunate end for what would otherwise be one of the all-time greatest dark fantasy franchises in video game history.Dark Souls 3 is disappointing. The new features which have been added (the MP meter, new poise calculations, special weapon attacks) only serve to highlight flaws in the gameplay. To spite going far out of the way to constantly remind players of Dark Souls 1, it fails to grow beyond many of the most frustrating and clumsy mistakes of the previous installments. What makes this perhaps worse is that many of the game systems which were abandoned (DS1's bonfire kindling DS2's power-stance and more refined statistic scaling, Bloodborne's Rally and more focussed weapon selection) are exactly what could have saved Dark Souls 3 from being the weak child of a strong family.Even judged entirely on its own, Dark Souls 3 still doesn't have very well designed gameplay. Movement is generally very sluggish, and even without any armor there is a very noticable delay between the button press and the beginning of an evasive roll. Timing windows on attacks in general seem to be out of synch with the animations (to an even more severe and confusing degree than Dark Souls 2, but for different reasons). This results in a lot of incidental damage from partially dodged attacks, failed parries, and enemies which are prohibitively difficult to stagger.Gone, also, are healing items other than the Estus flask. This is compounded by the addition of what amounts to an MP meter, which means that if you'll want to cast any spells you'll need to reassign some of your already finite healing flasks to MP flasks. Without the ""Rally"" mechanic of Bloodborne or the ability for enemies to drop more healing flasks, the frustration of dealing with even normal enemies is needlessly high.Demons' Souls, Dark Souls, and Bloodborne have never been famous for having a forgiving difficulty level, but what makes Dark Souls 3 disappointing isn't an issue of level design, learning curve, or enemy placement. The world design is the real let down.Most of the enemies and locations are heavily recycled. Very few of the bosses are not just ""a harder version of"" a boss battle from one of the other games. A number of the levels are just the ""winter"" versions of an area from either Dark Souls 1 or 2.Being that the community has already decided Dark Souls 3 is ""the best game in the series,"" one negative review isn't going to make a great deal of difference in the long run. Regardless of how well articulated or thought out, negative Steam reviews for Dark Souls 3 inevitably get voted down. But there is a statistic I can quote that helps illustrate my point.At time of writing, only 80% of the people who own the game have cleared the boss of the tutorial. Less than 50% have reached what is about the mid-way point. Less than 25% have finished the final boss.Dark Souls 1 and 2 have been available for much longer, and an even *smaller* percentage of players have reached these milestones on Steam.An estimated half of the people who insist Dark Souls 3 is the ""best game in the series"" have given up before the halfway point of all three games. Do with that information what you will.",0

Negative,"This review is for those having a hard time decide between PC and console versions of the gameAs a die hard fan of the Souls games (I've played Demon Souls, DS 1, 2, 3, Bloodborne), I would like to say that Dark Souls 3 is another great addition to the Soul's family. However, I would highly suggest purchasing the game for a console, instead of a PC.The PC is riddled with 3 major problems1. Hackers2. Illegitimate players (people gaining access to the game through illegitimate means (hint: pie rates(means hackers = impossible to rid of)3. Poor optimization (as with most Bandai Namco PC port).If you are a player that does not mind playing with hackers, having hackers join your game and one shot a boss, or having an invincible player join your game and destroy you in one hit/annoying you but not wanting to kill you/spawning mobs in your game, then PC is the gaming platform for you.I can definitely say that if I knew that the PC version of the game would have these problems, I would have purchased Dark Souls 3 for my PS4, so that I would not have had my gaming experience with Dark Souls 3 hindered by these avoidable circumstances.If you'd like to play Dark Souls 3 legit and enjoy it without having people ruin the experience for you, then you may want to consider console as an option (for those that have one).",0
Negative,"On it's surface, Dark souls 3 seems like the best game in the series. The animations are pretty, the enemies look badass, and the gameplay is smoother. Pros:-Best looking souls game, despite the fact that every zone is dark and gloomy-Faster gameplay.-some seriously badass bosses-special moves-soul memory is gone-armor doesn't need to be upgraded, thus you avoid wasting huge amounts of materials just trying things onCons:-The most broken multiplayer connectivity that I've seen in any game. There were weeks where 100% of co-op and invasions created an animation glitch, making multiple players or even a boss invulnerable-Challenges are overcome through memorization after losses, not skill or effort.-zero variety in environments. Sure, there may be a swamp and a castle over of cliff, but everything is a greyscale, nighttime gloomfest of spooky zombie creatures. At least Dark souls 2 had areas like Heides tower of Flame and Dragon Aerie-The amount of viable weapons is a joke at best. 90% of the weapons are worthless, no matter how cool they are. -poise is disabled/non-functional. This issue has been blown off multiple times.-This is the first souls game where I don't feel a sense of accomplishment after beating an area or boss. I wish I could describe why, but it may be a symptom of the rest of the cons.-patch notes don't give enough information-the community hates negative feedback, no matter how valid. Be prepared to have all complaints on all forums buried-I tried to refund for the broken online play, but was over the 2 hour mark. However, you probably won't ever encounter online play until well after 2 hours into the game, therefore nobody can get a refund for the thing that is broken-the game devolves into rolling spam and weak attacks.

Negative,"This game is alot of fun. Pleasant to look at and very engaging. I can't speak for everyone who plays, but I personally find the pvp enjoyable. Unfortunately, there is alot of hackers / griefers in the community. Hackers that have a broad horizon from simply joining your game, floating in the air as a dark spirit and cosplaying as certain characters (Personally seen hackers come into my world as Solaire, and I admit it was funny) to straight griefing. Hackers are a dime a dozen, and most have nothing better to do. Half the amount of time i put in this game has been spent in an area called Anor Londo, either invading or defending from dark spirits. I'm sure everyone has different ways they get enjoyment out of this particular game, let it be invading, helping other players as a phantom, killing bosses, fending off dark spirits, etc. This particular area, Anor Londo, is where I spend majority of my time playing. It is also where I experience the most dark spirits, and the most hackers. I've had the same hacker invade my world every time I've played, for the past month. His steam profile would change, but not his dark souls name. I've played with some friends in the same area (Anor Londo), Who would have hackers join their game, and kill the area's boss so my friends would be unable to pvp in said area until they replay the game (basically, grind just to get back to the same level, which is more hours spent for no reason other then a hacker wanted to be a dick). If you choose to play this game for the pve; With your friends who want a challenge, or just by yourself, it is great. If you choose to play this game for pvp; I cannot recommend purchasing this game for just that one element. Hackers are a good majority here, and they will make it a goal to grief you. A great way to waste your time & money.This is probably the one game i would recommend on the console soley due to the hacking being out of control on the pc.",0
Negative,"Everything good and bad about DS2 has returned.Some days, I can't go 5 minutes without being invaded. To make things worse, a lot of the time they are invisible or have no animations at all, so you're hit by invisible attacks. (I have FIOS and the connection is always perfect except during tornados). Didn't DS2 have a 30 minute timer for invasions? Apparently gone.Some of the game is not even fixed yet, but they ""balanced"" great sword damage already. Medium and High level lighting in graphics options crashes people at the bonfire, and the setting for that is shared with shadows, so it resets that setting each time you log in.Blue Sentinels and other ""cop"" covenants don't work, or rarely work.Remove the ""enhanced"" pvp where the worst connection wins and cracked red eye orbs are common as peanuts, and FIX YOUR CRAP, and this would of been a great game.",0

Negative,Dark Souls 3: Legacy Of CheatsOnly on PC,0
Negative,"I want to love this game, but the game doesnt love me, other players, or even itself.With a lot of the weapons, you can feel the sheer lack of creativity, the lack to make a fancy moveset that feels good and functions good like weve seen in many other previous installments such as a lot of Dark Souls 1 as well as Dark Souls 2s dlc weapons. This game lacks polish and origonal design, alot being borrowed from other games.The crucified ogres in the crucifixion woods use Father Gascoins moveset from Bloodborne, most enemies weve seen before or seen variations of before as well.Movesets feel really bad in a lot of cases, they feel rushed and underdeveloped as if someone really didnt care too much when making them for a lot of weapons, very limp.I got this same type of feeling when I played Dark Souls 2, alot of weapons felt ""floaty"" and rather unsatasfying. You could call it rose tinted glasses but weapons in Dark Souls 1 felt better, and even Demons Souls. Dark Souls 3 focuses more on giving you nostalgia than trying to wow you with creativity. One of the most creative areas of the game is Lothric Castle, the first and one of the last areas was one of those few creative areas I felt good about. Dark Souls 3s level design feels rather unappealing in a lot of ways but is generally okay, there couldve been more love and creativity in a lot of areas and I feel like they really didnt try to get crazy. The Catacombs are the catacombs, the demon ruins are the demon ruins, anor londo is anor londo, undead settlement is bloodborne. I can feel the lack of fun and the more pressure being put on them by Bamco.The game is filled with untested or generally missing mechanics, hyper armor is finnicky on a lot of weapons and poise is 100% absent, people keep testing to find out what it does and so far every single one has been disproven. Some enemies and some areas are flatout ruined by this missing poise, the fire breathed from a dragon staggers you every quarter of a second, enemies like the Thrall are scarier than some bosses too.You can mash your way through this game with r1 where as in Dark Souls 1, you could still do that but id be confident in saying its harder to do, even if you stacked defense and poise. People are afraid of poise returning to dark souls 3 but they forget that the backstab issues from dark souls 1 are fixed in this game and those issues wouldnt return, the stunlocks are gone and wont return as well.Now this just makes it all feel worse on top of everything ive listed.There is so much cut content from this game that im absolutely certain is going to be pushed into dlc, saved by bamco for extra dlc money. Youve got finished weapons, finished armor, all with stats and descriptions too. Im amazed at the lack of UNFINISHED cut content in the game.Maybe the DLCs will be better with Bamco taking a step back away from the pushed release date, but as it stands right now I dont think this game is worth buying and playing and I myself will be stopping until the DLCs release and even then, if the game still isnt fixed I might not come back for a year or so to see if any of the actual game mechanical issues get fixed.I played a lot of Dark Souls 1, Dark Souls 2 and Dark Souls 3, ive played Demon Souls and I have not yet played Bloodborne to my own distress. I can confidently say this game is not very good at its current state and itll be a good long while before that changes, as I have said above.Thank you for reading and I hope you can understand my point of view.Responce to Lazbot:Ill answer your questions one by one.I got 355 hours of entertainment out of the game for 60 dollars, but much of that was trying to see if its my fault I am not enjoying it or if its the games fault, you cant know until you sink time into it. Alot of the replayability comes from the PvP and its a shame that the PvP is so horribly done this time around that it barely feels like Dark Souls at all.I dont think the hours I put in warrants a reccomendation because had I known the game would still not be balanced at the time of writing this right now, I would not have sunk all that time into the game in the first place. My review is targeted at both audiences since, if a new souls player isnt interested in the PvP, hes better off playing Dark Souls 1 since its a more challenging and, in my opinion, a better designed game. The world design is so much more intertwined and strung together geniously, and while the game is a technical mess being one of the worst optimized games ive ever played on PC, I still dont mind it.I honestly do regret buying this game because I bought the deluxe season pass edition and im hoping that, much like Dark Souls 2, the DLC can really save this game.I wasnt expecting complete originality but there are so many little cool ideas in this game that it amazes me that they couldnt do more, and if they were going to recycle old things from the old games, the least they couldve done is do it well. The Ithirial Dungeon is the Tower of Lyriat from demon souls without the charm, atmosphere or interesting setting. I also would have liked to see a connected world without teleports much like DS1. That was always something I liked best about Dark Souls 1, no warp until youre done with Anor Londo and even when you get the warp, you still cant warp to every bonfire in the game, you still have to walk SOME places.I dont think its expecting too much to have a balanced game, I can see way too many design flaws that, if I had the coding experience, the time, and the oppertunity, I could fix. Im trying to learn a lot about game design and balance so I can one day have the chance to actually work on games like this and fix their problems. I dont think its expecting too much for the Poise stat to actually work or at least change the description of it to actually say what it does.",0

Negative,"Servers are down for a week;From software never really cared about cheaters and exploits for years, and the only reason for them to be so adamant in fixing this right now is because someone made a really serious exploit public. Their laziness in fixing extremely easy exploits has come back to haunt them and its poetic.",0
Negative,"Cheapest enemy encounters in history of gaming. But biggest shortcoming besides stupid stamina managment and slow ass repetitiveness after dying again and again while trying to collect your souls or make progress, are the controller controls. The game is a clusterfukk to play and navigate through its menus. I feel crippled right from the start and the pain never ends switching between items and weapons on the fly while watching creeps doing broken attack pattern and ganging up on me from all around the corners, from behind trees and up on the ceiling there are. fukk you!Oh yes i forgot all the builds of Characters u could do. Awesome, eh!? WRONG, because all the game wants from you is to become the fukking Monkey King of Lordran rolling around the place to impress your toxic PVP buddies. fukk your Iframes, fukk your memes, fukk you toxic kids and fukk you Dark Souls!",0

Negative,A PC game with hints just for a controller. I do not have one. It is an absolutely terrible experience to be looking up the keyboard bindings in the menu all the time.,0
Negative,The tips for the controls are absolutely idiotic for a PC game. It is really lazy programming to give controller symbols tips for a keyboard+mouse setup.,0
Negative,If you prefer to play with a keyboard and mouse dont get this game. I love the Dark Souls games but even Dark Souls 2 had better controls than this one. Even key instructions are displayed using X-Box controller configurations when you are using a keyboard making it impossible to figure out how to perform moves except through trial and error. To top it off you cant even change keybindings.,0
Negative,"I wouldnt recomend this game right now.Why because it costs nearly 90,- and than the PC implementation is realy realy Bad if i buy a Game which has such an High price than the PC implenentation should be finished.I dont want to se my Moves Explained with Controller Buttons i mean i am playing on a PC and it is a PC VERSION so it should show the buttons on your keyboard and Mouse. If that would be fixed it would be a good game.",0
Negative,"The lore is a mashed together mess, it doesn't really add anything significant and relies too heavily on ""Hey remember this from Dark Souls 1?"" or ""This item from Dark Souls 2 is here because uhhhh time is fucked up and the world is ending""The combat is boring and easy. You just use you 10k iframes roll to dodge any attack in the game, which you have to do since they pretty much killed off poise so that the shitty weapon arts could have a function in the game. Magic is nowhere near as fun as it was in previous games, and if you want to do a pure mage build, say goodbye to healing items.The pvp is an awful R1 spam mess with worse net code than Dark Souls 2, and even when you do get an invasion with a decent connection, you will undoubtedly be up again a host with 2-3 phantoms all with a seemingly infinite supply of estus.Overall this game is an overrated piece of trash, and honestly so is the community surrounding this game.",0
Negative,"A lazy PC port. Buttons are not even changed from the XBOX controller. ""Press A or B"" Hold R2 for strong attack, stuff like that. Cant really speak for the rest of the game, but if they cant be arsed to do a proper port its not worth my time either.",0
Negative,"So i can't recover souls because of a glitch where i was in the ladder tower in anor londo, hit the switch to go down and was summoned for an aldrich covenant invasion and when i spawned back into my world i fell from where the tower was initially and now i see no reason to even play this any more. Like i damn near want a refund because of this but i know i won't get one and i know from wont ever see this or give a rat's ass.

Still, this is a great game! Just going to wait for a patch.",0
Negative,"Gonna commit one of my regularly scheduled blasphemies real quick.Dark souls 3 is the worst dark souls. If you are interested in hearing why and maybe are the 1% of people who never played it, read along. (And if you don't mind massive text walls)To begin, I have to show a statistic. Dark souls 2 sold 2 million copies. Dark souls 3 sold 10 million copies. There really is no question dark souls three sold VASTLY more copies than both of the previous games combined (before the remasters) Why is this important?Simple. The vast majority of the people who played (And praised) Dark souls 3 never played a dark souls before it. This leads to them having no basis as to what the game should be. Surf any forum on the game and you will find that every flaw the game has is construed as an intended feature by a legion of people who think they are experts on the souls series for playing the most popular game. This is not an irregular occurence either, super popular sequels suffer from this kind of self-affirming echo chamber pretty regularly. Even super successful games with no sequels such as say, Cruelty squad, get this problem. To put the problem in words, ""Armor is bad because you arent supposed to use it"" ""Magic is bad because its a melee game bro"" ""You were meant to play the game naked""Continuing the cruelty squad analogy, that game recieved a patch that broke armor values. They simply dont work. It has not been fixed. Ask why, and people will spew out this idea that it was on purpose, a sort of symbol that armor is not how you are SUPPOSED to play. This same echo chamber mentality exists with the community of people who only played Dark souls 3. Every flaw in the game is interpreted as an artistic design decision meant to punish players for wrongthink.Now, if you can step outside of this box for a second, ask yourself, if you played say, a CoD title and picked up an AK, and upon firing it, found it did no damage at all. Would you consider it a screw up, a balance issue, or the incredible manifestation of some genius dev's artistic vision? .Duh, right? But because so many people played DS3 first and wanted to be in the know about a popular game (Gotta be up to date with the fad) You couldnt say anything wrong about it. Same as the initial launch of say, Fallout 4. People wanted it, people got it, new people thought it was the best thing ever because they had no comparison point, now it's generally recognized as the modern series worst entry. Couple this with ideas such as the concept that getting turned invincible for dodging is somehow more skillful than trying to use a shield and stamina effectively (And everyone wants to be skilled, of course) and you get what we have now.I have babbled a lot on why this game is often heralded as the best souls game, but I haven't yet talked about what is wrong with it. Put it simple, outside of the fact the game is gorgeous, Dark souls 3 is incredibly shallow. Magic, heavy armor, great weapons, bows/crossbows, any non-medium/light build has been nerfed with a sledgehammer compared to its dark souls 1/2 iterations. People complained about magic, and they got what they wanted. Dark souls 3 introduced limited non-regenerating mana, that you have to sacrifice your health source for, and magic as a whole might as well be useless outside of specific PvE encounters where it can help to cheese stuff. Heavy armor and poise do almost literally nothing other than make you fatroll, and since rolling grants you total invincibility for multiple frames, and lighter rolls more of them, you can see why any build that harms the ability to roll cannot be used seriously. The devs seem to have decided at some point that they wanted to do bosses more like bloodborne which reward you for being aggressive with your dodges, but at the same time did not give the players the same boosts bloodborne did to allow that. The camera when you press up to a boss makes it nearly impossible to predict their next move so you can time a dodge, but you have to be aggressive because the devs wanted you to because it earned Bloodborne praise (For reference, in older souls titles the battle premise was usually to attack then dodge AWAY, not INTO the targets) This system being forced onto enemies that are reused from games not meant to have it causes an enormous amount of pain to players who are trying to fight a reskin of the first boss from dark souls (Asylum demon) in a game that has forcefully taught them to be very aggressive. This works poorly because that same boss, which uses its same moveset from dark souls 1, was designed to PUNISH players for being too aggressive. See the issue?The total focus on one playstyle coupled with the aggressive lean leads to a very shallow gameplay loop. Attack, dodge dodge, attack, if you mistime a dodge or misinterpret the attack the foe is doing (cuz yer camera is usually up their rectum and that makes it hard to see) then you dodge away to heal, then dodge in. Dodge, attack, heal, repeat. It is as shallow as it gets. That is not to say that the previous titles didnt include that, but build variety allowed players to add their own steps to the loop. In 3 doing so is almost always only going to reduce your efficiency.The NPC character interactions are extremely easy to break, which can screw the whole run just by talking to a character before you open a specific door. The game is hyper linear, whereas the first two were very open. Enemy AI is still pitifully dumb, glitches and exploits that have never been fixed abound and make common shows in PVP. The game is literally in a state where its servers are offline because the weird punish-you-for-coop invasion system is literally so unchecked that people were able to join your game and reset you to the beginning of the playthrough. Modders have made anticheat for this game, From soft. will not do it. For all of that ranting, I concede that dark souls 3 is a gorgeous game. The art direction and the work behind it show through in every enemy, every area, and every piece of equipment. It is fantastic. But that being said, dark souls 3 is a souls game telling the same story that has been told for 2 games now, you need to go light the magic fire for reasons. Takes place in the same environments, with many of the same foes. So at the end of the day, you end up playing a Very pretty, but linear dark souls 1 that has no build variety outside of medium/light armor and melee weapons. Standing alone, dark souls three would have been an absolutely fantastic first entry in the series, and since it was that first entry for many people, it was well received. But for those who did play the first two before it, everything outside of graphics feels like a pretty heavy downgrade. As players we have got to realize that if we praise bad game design, howl at people who point out flaws, and hold up flawed games as icons of perfection, that we are going to get more flawed, bad games because we are giving positive feedback to negative things. We are the positive reinforcement for teams of developers, if we give a thumbs up to mistakes, oversights, or whatever, they cannot be blamed for repeating those errors. It is our fault.",0
Negative,Wouldn't spend 5 minutes on this game.,0
Negative,"Seriously, that's such a shame. The game is great, i did it solo on PS4, out of online, and i had a good feeling on the gameplay. The main issue is the online system. My experience got so ruined by trying to play coop. It makes no sense. Such a waste. First you can't easy connect to your friend (shitty ember system.) but OK. I accept it and play by the rules, having to do TWICE the same area. And not being able to come back with a mate after doing it both of you. It's already annoying. And with that, you have invasion. Ok it's nice having challenge, but it make no sense. You have HL hacker that come to pick you non stop, one shooting you. So all you can do is go ALT F4 to avoid those, that kill you and get you to stop your coop. So fun when ALT F4 is the only way to save yourself.Seriously WTF ! Give us a good coop ! That shit ruins the experience ! I never got so much angry at a game, because it has such a good gameplay, but so shitty system. It's like a billionair that would shoot himself in the head ! DO SOMETHING ! Give the people who just wanna enjoy the adventure a NORMAL COOP SYSTEM ( i connect to my friend and we move together normaly) ! I beat the game once. It's not a ""difficulty"" affair. It's just a shitty system that ruined my experience of the game and the one of my friend i wanted to initiate to the franchise. How am i supposed to make my friend like Dark Soul without a proper coop mode, with permanent invasion of HL player that OTK you, needing to do twice each area, not being able to come back inside with your friend so the result is each one of us wander alone when backtrack is needed. I never got so pissed off at a game damm, and for the wrong reason. Game is very good. Multiplayer system is the worst EVER. And i am not even talking about the FPS drop issue. Anyway : that's my warning -) If you want this game for multiplayer -) DONT BUY IT ! else it's ok.At least until we get some new multi coop system. Or a mod.So sad, so much potential wasted.",0

Negative,"Dark Souls 3 is very good; but a very small/short game. The PVP is good, and the bosses themselves are somewhat difficult.

Negative,"npcs look kinda cool, combat is ok, not as bad as elden ring where bosses just hold for minutes, still most of the combat is only difficult because youre fighting multiple enemies, because you have to fight in an impractical place or because bosses are so big that you just cant see shit. that kind of poor artificial difficulty just is not fun to me. PVP is absolute garbage and just annoying. this game has the worst netcode you will ever see, people just roll around for minutes. i know some people swear on these games but i think they are extremely overrated",0
Negative,"My friend bought this game for me and honestly that is the only reason i gave it a try and i regret it heavily. The developpers were too lazy and incompetent to even make controls prompts for keyboard and mouse and instead left it all to xbox gamepad controls. One (ore maybe even more for all i know) of the starter classes limits the possibility of passing the tutorial, thus nullifying the very purpose of the class (thief) given that they cannot defeat the tutorial boss with any level of skill someone who just started the game would have. I found that with the assassin class i was able to beat it in one try without failure, which emphasizes the fact that an entire beginner class of an RPG video game was shat on from the very get go. A lot of people attempt to claim that this game requires skill, and in the time i've played and seen my friends play (who are diehard darksouls fans) i have seen but two buttons be pressed, spacebar and left mouseclick. It is absolutely depressing to see people attempt to defend such a broken game. Especially when a game who's main focus is PVE has AI so simplistic, that the majority of the 'grunts' will literally lock on, and if given the chance, pull a 720 whilst swinging their weapon in one attack, just so that their lock on can reach the target. Now to get on to the fact that a game focused on PVE is a rinse wash repeat of killing the same grunts over and over so many times you would believe you're playing dynasty warriors. IF anyone is thinking of buying this game, i highly recommend pirating it first to see if your diseased brain has some sort of affinity to this game, then at the very least waiting for a 80-% off sale to even begin considering letting it sully your steam library.",0

Negative,"Not as bad as DS2 but this series has devolved so much it is now purely about I-Frame dodging through boss fights. You learn their moveset, press the dodge button at the right time then punish until you win. Every single boss is the same, almost all of them are giant armoured dudes (or ladies) with massive weapons and you play skiprope with their weapon. There is no need to use your brain, almost none of the bosses have weaknesses you can exploit or tactics you can utilise to get the upper hand. Just dodge, mash R1, rinse repeat.

Negative,"It's like Dark Souls 1, except it's just frustrating to play.This game is basically left overs from Bloodborne disguised as Dark Souls. This obviously wasn't properly tested before release. It has all the bad parts of Dark Souls, along with the WRONG part of Bloodborne. The rabid enemies from bloodborne do not mix well with the slower combat of Dark Souls. It tries to succeed in being both Bloodborne and Dark Souls at the same time, but it ends up succeeding in neither of the two, and instead is a mix of unbalanced garbage where the superior PvE tactic is always spammy straight swords, and in PvP it is stunlocking Ultra Greatswords and estus chugging.The weapons feel really good to use, but most of the fun ones are found at the end of the game, so you barely get a chance to use them unless you always want to go to NG+ and beyond everytime you want to make a new build. And even then it's all rushing through the game to get upgrade materials so you can actually kill the enemies before they have time to start their 45-hit stunlocking combo.Poor enemy design is the major flaw of this game. (See Cathedral Knight with giant 300kg swords that they swing like a butter knife, Man-Serpent that do not care about there being a wall in the way of his chain-axe, he WANTS to throw a giant axe through it, the never-ending spam combo knights of the Boreal Valley, the spammy thralls that contribute nothing good to the game whatsoever, the cheating invader NPCs with infinite stamina/magicka that can parry you while drinking estus, the giant black pus snake-hollow-things that just murder your camera so you can't see anything, and many more)Also, disconnects from servers frequently and this can penalize you.Also, Darkmoon Covenant doesn't work lol.",0
Negative,"It's not as good as expected. It feels weird, a hybrid between Bloodborne and Dark Souls.I don't like the fact that there is no Steam Cloud. That's it.",0
Negative,good but steam advised to remaster my review,0
Negative,"This game is one of the most disappointing games I have ever played. Combined with the first two installments, I have a little under 800 hours of Dark Souls experience, and I've beaten all three multiple times at this point. Suffice to say, I have plenty of experience, and I know what I'm talking about.PVEOn my first playthrough, I built my character like I have in every past game, as a glass cannon. This has almost never been a problem, as it would allow me to one or two shot most enemies while still being able to take three or four hits before I died. I traded survivability for damage, and this higher risk higher reward gameplay was what I was seeking in DS3. This is not what I got. I spent the entirety of the playthrough getting one-shotted by every single mob outside of the first village, and my damage was not coming even close to one-shotting the enemies. I eventually beat the game, but it took a considerably long time, and I missed a bunch of stuff because I was really afraid to explore anything. Fast forward to the second playthrough. I create a knight, and pour all of my initial points into vigor, leveling it up to 30 before starting on anything else. I then beat the game with a total death count of 3, two of which being from falling to my death, and the third being from getting corner trapped by a really fat npc for literally half a minute. I could survive even the most unfair of attacks from enemies like they were nothing, and then I would just use one of my 16 estus charges to heal to almost completely full again. The game doesn't play like the others, you either play like a fucking turtle or you die. This is a recurring theme throughout DS3. Boss fights, arguably the pinnacle of the souls games are attrociously easy. Using the dried finger, you can now summon three co-op partners and just sit back in the fucking corner while your sunbros beat it for you. That's not to say that I didn't die on certain boss fights, there were still some that took a couple tries, but it was mainly because they had some really annoying gimmick, not because they had a challenging mechanic to try and overcome. This is also a recurring theme. After beating a boss in DS3, I didn't feel the wave of accomplishment that I've felt with the other games. The first words that popped into my head weren't ""Oh my god I beat it"", they were ""Finally, that was obnoxious."" Time and time again, I felt annoyed playing it, and coming back to what should be one of my favorite games of all time felt like a chore. That's the real failure of this game, it doesn't feel challenging, it feels vexxing. There are some new mechanics, such as the weapon skills or the mana bar that are really nice changes, but they don't outweigh the rest of the trash heap. Many enemies are ripostable but not parryable, the animation on backstabs is terrible, they took away the shield break and replaced it with the inferior kick, and armor isn't upgradable anymore, which is an awful idea.PVPThis is probably the worst installment of PVP yet, and I've lived through zweihander giantdads and helix spear mastodon halberd power stance. They've made some changes to the matchmaking, one of which being that invaders are significantly more likely to invade a host that already has at least one phantom. This is a terrible fucking decision. They've taken one of the worst pvp situations in the game, and made it more likely to happen than before. Dark Souls at its core, is a game about stats, and the player uses their weapons and timings and whatever else to make their stats overcome the other persons stats. In a 2v1, or a 3v1, or even a goddamn 4v1 (which has happened multiple times to me), there's almost no outcome where the 1 wins. The only way the invader wins, is if other invaders happen to invade, which makes it a 2v2 where you can hurt each other at best, or the other side majory screws something up. On top of that, they made healing much more prevalent in pvp. When you invade, you get half of the estus that you would normally have, and while other summoned phantoms get the same, the host gets all of their charges. Combined with the shitty kick that we have now, it is completely possible for someone to just hide behind a greatshield and dump estus down their throat for like twenty minutes while their seventeen other friends come in and beat your ass. Invading is slow, it's obnoxious, and it's not fun. On top of that, parrying does way too much damage. You take slightly less damage, and no poise damage whenever you miss a parry, which is stupid, and if you hit one, you can basically just one shot your opponent. Every single match devolves into two walking tanks spamming parry, and backing away to heal to full life fifteen times until one guy hits the parry and insta kills the other guy. It's just like the meta at the very end of Dark Souls 2, and you know what, it was fucking lame then too.ConclusionWhile I've certainly said some heated words in this review, anger isn't the first emotion that's popping into my mind; it's sadness. I've been looking forward to this game for long and I wanted so badly for this game to be great, but it just did not deliver. My enthusiasm was met with one-shots, ultra-defensive pve, terrible pvp, and a framerate that makes the game completely unplayable at some points. I am incredibly frustrated, but more than anything, I'm just disappointed. I'm going to 100% this game, and get the dark soul achievement, just like I did with Dark Souls 2, and then I'm never going to touch this garbage ever again. Best of luck to you if you're wishing to buy it.",0
Negative,"You know I really did enjoy this game, I came over from xbox about a year ago and picked this up again because why not. Unfortunately while this is an amazing game it is plagued by hackers, you will see plenty of people using god mode, infinite damage unarmed, ect. My main character at SL120 is now softlocked in an infinite you died loop because of some stupid hacker. Good job wasting my time fromsoft",0
Negative,"This game is utter horse ***. It is cheap, unfair, and ultimately just the masochistic manifestation of game designers who delight in making players angry. I hate every stupid minute of this absolute turd and I constantly screaming ""WHAT EVEN THE ****?!"" when things don't go my way (which is often). 10/10 can't stop playing.",0
Negative,"Good game and everything , i like it however buy it if you want to get banned for using PS3 controller or EGPU solution of NVidia Shadow play , or by just starting CE you will get permantly banned , i bought the game with dlc and now iam going to ask for refund .",0
Negative,"The game itself is quite fun.not as fun as ds1 but still.- level design not as near as close ds1- poor optmization and bugs (crashes)- Bandai Namco+ OST+ weapons specialsBut i would not recoomend it.because it has awful performance.fps go up and down like crazy.it crashes near bonfiresThere are cases of corrupted save games due to crash.controller incompatibility .it is painful to play with keyboard+mouse.some people the game does not even run.stay with white screenThe main reason i would not recoomend it is : Bandai Namco.Japanese were suppose to be polite and efficient right? Well these guys dont give any useful feedback to its community, promoted the game via streamers/youtubers and got the game spoiled.japanese release was way earlier and yet the game was launched with problems and no patch are nowhere to be seen without mention they would change the requiriments frequently.they rose the prices in several regions.more than once in some of them, I got banned from bandai facebook for asking a satisfaction on those matters and i was NOT rude.matter of fact I was very polite",0
Negative,"The over all game is amazing but nowadays with the game the way it is and so close to the launch of elden ring I wouldn't bother picking it up because of two reason 1. ELDEN RING2. HACKERS, the hacking problem in this game has gone far beyond SIMPle trolls and has reach people hacking into my game and modding my character against my will and making them un-playable unless I wanna be banned to the cheaters server which is a hard pass for me pretty much unless your gonna play offline all the time don't get this game just wait for elden ring.",0
Negative,"Stop looking at the review, just buy it.",0
Negative,Silly game takes up all of your free time 'cause it's unrealisticly good,0
Negative,"Grand Archives finally made me quit.I could only tolerate this game so far.I guess Dark Souls 1 really was an accidental masterpiece.In terms of artificial difficulty this game is actually worse than Dark Souls 2.There are way too many gimmick boss fights.In fact the only two boss fights I genuinely enjoyed in this game were the Dancer of Boreal Valley and Dragonslayer Armour.Because they are a test of your skill to dodge,attack and counter attack unlike all the other bosses.Even though in the Dragonslayer Armour fight you are bombarded with missiles by Pilgrim Butterflies that you can't reach and kill.You have little to no poise even wearing the Cathedral Knight Armour.Attacks feel weak.Rolls and backsteps are weird.And It doesn't have the feeling of a realm that is slowly dying that only you can save.Even DS2 did a better job at that.And this is coming from someone who is not a fan of Dark Souls 2.Doesn't feel fair,doesn't feel fun,doesn't feel like Dark Souls.EDIT:I gave this another shot after having played Mortal Shell.Somehow it was even worse this time.",0
Negative,10 poise out of 10.,0
Negative,It took my balls and scratched them,0
Negative,"I cannot recommend this game in its current state. I have had 15+ crashed to desk top in less than two hours of play. This dissapointment is only punctuated by the fact that this is otherwise everything I am looking for in a Souls game. I have tried all of the ""fixes"" that the internet recommends and have had no better luck. This is not a $60 game in its current state, it is not really a game at all considering I can't even leave the tutorial area. I expected better.",0
Negative,"People need to stop pretending this is a good videogame, most of the time you get invaded by hackers or tryhards with cheese builds that feel acomplished for killing you with the most sweat setup.It has even more ganks than DSII and obnoxious enemies. Boss lineup isn't even that great to begin with.",0
Negative,"The game is just outright broken. There was simply put no Q&A (that s quality assessment if you didn t know) done. Like at all. PC gamers got shafted with a version of the game that just outright crashes every time you get close to a bonfire while you have a shield equipped.Let me walk you through it: You face an enemy obviously you have a shield equipped you die, you respawn at the last bonfire, you still have said shield equipped, the game crashes. You restart the game, you spawn at the last location the game placed you at, which is the fricking bonfire aaaand the game crashes again. When they told us about the never ending cycle of the Dark Souls world I really had something else in mind. How can this pass the Q&A? Why was this not addressed? How could endless players and streamers have the game and none picked that up? By the way, I m far from the only one who encountered that bug. Look at Steam. I really love the franchise but I cannot play the game past the first bonfire. It crashes and crashes and crashes. I mean sure, I could do a no shield run, but since this is my very first time playing DS3 that would be a hard thing to do. Sure, I love me a good challenge but come on. The problem is, that FromSoft obviously places no worth in the PC community at all. Look at the facts. DS1 was released no one rushed them to it, they had all the time in the world. The game was completely broken and was only fixed by the modding community. DS2 was released one whole month after the consoles got their version. It wasn t broken but half of the promised features were missing and they had to re-release the game as the scholar of the first sin edition in order to implement them. Now DS3 is out. I would have loved to make a review, but I can t. Since I can t progress through the game. So yeah, that was my little bug report/appreciation message for the stellar job FromSoft did with their latest game. Maybe it s awesome. Maybe it s a masterpiece that dwarfs even the likes of Half Life 2. But unfortunately I don t know that. So thanks again. I took a day off from work only to stare at a crash report screen for hours straight.",0
Negative,faith sucks balls,0
Negative,-i thought itd be shit but turns out its not shit!,0
Negative,"Spent the first day trying to stop it from crashing. It's pretty fun once you get past that, but it's not worth the hassle, especially not at full price. Buy the console version instead, it's more stable.",0
Negative,DeS > DaS1 > BB >> DaS3 >DaS2fite meAlmost the worst of the series. Stay away unless you've beaten all the previous Souls games and really need a fix. Inexplicable performance issues alongside widespread balance problems plague the game currently.,0
Negative,"While the game can be very entertaining, there are numerous flaws such as the horribly done multiplayer where invaders will almost always get ganked unless they're twinking, and the unimaginably awful connection. The level design is a step down from the first two games. It's fairly linear and not very open-eneded. Perhaps if the game dropped to $40 I would reccomend but the $60 they ask you to fork up isn't really worth what the game gives you. 2/5",0
Negative,"If you enjoy being angry for hours on end and then maybe eventually beating a boss and feeling wonderful for 5 seconds and then doing that all over again, this is a game for you.Don't buy this if you have anger issues / you're already too stressed out. It's not a fun time, it's a difficult time with fun in between if you play with people.",0
Negative,"I have tried so many times to get into this game. I can't. People complain about ganks in DS2, but this game has far more, and they are worse. The combat tries to replicate Bloodborne and fails, staying in a weird in-between of it and Dark Souls style gameplay. Not to mention the very linear levels are a chore to get through, and despite this game supposedly having all the best bosses, only half of them are good. After my fourth time trying to get through the game over the course of multiple years, I can't take it anymore. Disappointing.",0
Negative,"As previously stated i would update my review, based on my three full runs of game 2 on PC and one on XBOX one its still very much a thumbs down and here is why.Over all of the 3 instalments of ""Dark Souls"", number one had a great adventure and was super cool for jolly coop. The one thing ""Dark Souls 2"" did better was mechanics, they brought the game to life for a MUCH better combat imo.While the story wasn't great and the world was a bit small and oddball it was not enough to be deterred from a gazillion hours or play.How ever ""Dark Souls 3"" the best way I can describe this to you is like so.If poise worked the same as it does in ""Dark Souls 3"", in the ""Dark souls 1"" edition. And the same ridiculous crap was happening as it does in the third instalment today, I would NEVER have followed the series to where it is now. ""Dark Souls 2"" may have added more stats like agility etc, but they worked as intended. And the over all mechanics were better, I also understand the need for changes to CERTAIN THINGS. But to the fundamentals of what made the game what it is, what do you think kept the vets coming back ?And the new guys coming ? The HYPE was real, and for the first 2 games that stands true, and it was we VETs who put the hype their. But alas the ""Dark Souls 3 "" finale is a Firm FLOP imo.With a miserable 3 runs in total under my belt 2 on PC and 1 on XB1, my attention spanned to doing fight arenas. Which unfortunately just made it even more noticeable, how poor the mechanics really are in this edition of the game. And thus I haven't played ""Dark Souls 3"" for at least the last two days, what a sad farewell to a game so dearly loved by many and expected much more for a finale.",0
Negative,"I suffer from clinical depression and to make things worse I recently lost my job and my wife left me for a man clearly better than me in every way. She took the children too and they love their new dad, because he's a better dad. that added a lot of hurt. I poured every minute into this game as a means of escape from my miserable existence. Guess what? Even with nothing else to do in my stinking bedsit and driven by rage I Couldn't kill the first boss.",0
Negative,Too hard for my small brain,0
Negative,"don't reccomend it. EVERYTHING that attacks you staggers you. poise now only effects roll i-frames. it's basically a net negative the way it works.FROM can't be bothered to say more than 'we made a few changes to a couple weapons' in their patch notes, and for some reason prioritize nerfing weapons that don't really need it, over the ones that do.the entire heavy armor class is useless, not enough defence gain for the weight, and heavy weapons are pretty much the same way.since everything staggers you, and combat is now so damn fast, in pve it turns into stun them before they stagger you. it's also extremely annoying when you come up against a group of enemies which can stun lock you easily if they hit you, often turning into a death sentence",0
Negative,they killed the servers for some reason.,0
Negative,"If you prefer keyboard/mouse playstyle, go somewhere else. The controller controls are also too janky for me.",0
Negative,"Not mine - spent about 120 hours to came up to a conclusionDifficulty is not to be skilled. its to go stupid farming to get your lvls to beat something. Ok, you can do quite everything without farming but the fights talke a lot of unnecessary time then.The fighting feels so sluggy compared to other especially fighting gamesCamera movement is a pain.You can only reskill your charakter 5-times for ever play-through. And you have to free up the place to do it. just another time consumer.Its a good idea to lvl up your weapons and armor but again you have to go stupid farming.They tried to mix an Action Adventure with a Fighting Game. It's a good idea but lacks a lot of balancing (fighting, equip/stat ratio, bosses, etc.). And not maintained anymore today.Pro:Level, Sound and Character Design is neat and was the main reason to keep playing. Over this they did a good job by scripting quite every corner and you get scared/thrilled very often. But playing through 1 time is enough for me.All in all everything in this game feels like unnecessary time wating. I know some people like exactly this but for me it's not up to date. Maybe Sekiro would be better for me. After all these years the best Soulslike for me was ""Severance: Blade of Darkness"" so far.Even after 5 years it's fair to do such a comment if they still wanna take the full/high price for it. Really FromSoftware if you want that high price after all the years go on and maintain your stuff. And over all implement an anticheat like othes said.I can not recommand it especial for that high price tag for the reasons aboce. Also if your a casual gamer wanna just play throug a game you probably get frustrated cause the difficulty might be hard for you.",0
Negative,i want to kill my self playing this,0
Negative,"So, it is a popular game, let's try it right? No, don't do it, unless you extremly good in action games or you is a masochist.I personally prefer strategy games, logical games where you need to use your brain, i know my reflexes not the best. Still, sometimes i want to play some action game too. Because of my preferences i not doing it often so if you like me avoid this game at all cost.For me this was the worst game i ever tried/played. Even shovelware games have more entertainment value. How come?First of all, when i playing something on steam, on a PC platform, then I would like to see at least keyboard and mouse icons, how to navigate in the game, on the menu. The first challenge was to figure out how to leave the options. Iam not kidding, ESC not worked.Then it continues on tutorial: every single action, combat moves, EVERYTHING is shown how it need to be done via controller. while playing a PC version. Ok, another challenge done, trying to translate those at keybindings. Believe it or not, changing the keybindings was also a heroic task. If you set everathing you need to figure out how to leave the options again. First time not managed to figure out, while i was at menu, but this time ESC worked! Hell yeah. Uhh, ok why my changes not worked? Everything on default again! If they create a PC port then they should at least learn how menus and actions work for other games OR at least show the required buttons instead of showing controller buttons i can't use.Ok, now i can control everything properly, sound adjusted to an acceptable level and it not killing my ears anymore, killing monsters easily, ahh, this is just the tutorial. Then we get to the tutorial boss. Ok, he coming with a 10m long halberd, impossible to dodge anything, you also get hit while dodging, and he attacks again so fast that you still can't move yet because of the previous hit and you got hit again. Boss literally 1shot you. I know many interpretes this as ""hell, the game is hard, it is cool"" but actually for me it looks so that the whole game is just bugged and not working properly. No, iam not that guy who giving up on everything fast, but the fact that nearly never managed to dodge any attack, no matter to what direction i dodged, it still hit me, stunlocked me and killed. The only time i managed to get lower than 90% was when i just kept running away and attacked twice fast when jumped to my previous location. Still died because this was a time consuming method and still changed insanely fast to another attack form and killed me again while i was rolling/dodging away. Why do they even have a button for dodge? Perhaps not even the developers know the answer.Probably 90% of the players finishing/playing this with trainers, but where is the fun to play like that? Easier to choose a real, good, entertaining game, instead of this.Some friend told me the goal of this game is to make players to rage. Well, this should be on store page then. Unfortunatly i don't like to rage and if i buy something i want to be entertained.",0

Negative,"Absolutely terrible controls if you don't like controllers. Games that are hard because of the controls and not the mechanics should not be praised for their difficulty, it feels like you are trying to play with a guitar hero controller.

Negative,Worst combat balance of the 3 games. Not really fun to play more than once.,0
Negative,"very unpredictable performance. hope they fix this. does not matter how good or bad your computer is. getting a decent FPS is more about luck than performance. forums are filled with ppl that cant play due to low FPS with very good computers, and ppl being able to play with fine FPS on a toasters. wait for upgrades.",0
Negative,"The combat is improved from the earlier games, but I realised here that the combat wasn't a very big part of what I loved about Demon's Souls and Dark Souls 1 anyway. There was something else, like a mystery to the world that is now missing. I don't see the purpose of beating Giant Royal Humanoid Swordfighter if I'm not excited about what's coming after. And for that reason I'm out.",0
Negative,"The game itself is fantastic. FromSoftware. is a bunch of cock sucking fuck monkeys that need to eat a large bag of turds. Wasted 60+ hours on leveling characters and playing through ridiculously hard levels only to randomly get banned out of no where. You might think the soft ban is not a big deal, it's a single player game after all. WRONG Every covenant in the game relies on multiplayer, Some areas are damn near impossible without assistance. The whole grind isn't about finishing the game. It's about reaching the meta to test your pvp mettle agaisnt other people who have sunk countless hours into the game. And now thousands of people are sittign with a $60 hunk of nothing in their steam library. Thanks FromSoftware. Love you long time.",0
Negative,"I have never cheated in a Dark Souls game in my life. As many others have stated, it is likely that I was banned to an alternate server, only I was never notified and have no idea why. A day ago, the high wall of lothric would be littered with signs, orange and white, as well as invaders popping up every few minutes. Now, the game is like a ghost town. As much as I love the series itself, I also love the multiplayer. I did not pay the full price for 50% of a game. This is horrible. Bandai Namco can't do their jobs correctly and the players are punished for it with no repurcussion to the company. I also feel bad about writing a negative review but they deserve a 0/10 for banning people for no reason. Until the problem is fixed, this game is not worth buying because chances are that you will pay full price for half of what the game is stated for.",0
Negative,"Don't buy the game if you want to play it with a mouse an keyboard. it's all bugged, everything is for a controller, every prompt is for the controller button (ex: press ""B"", from controller, to go back. it's actually ""Q"" for keyboard).The camera is fucked, sound is fucked, aiming is fucked. everything is wrong control wise.DO NOT BUY IT!Yeah, you can reset it, but to spend more than 60$, including DLCs, then getting this shit. It's practically a scam.",0
Negative,"Difficult for the sake of being difficult. Enemies have infinite stamina so they can just spam attacks forever until you run out of stamina rolling and they hit you, looking at you borreal outrider. Played through DS 1 and DS 2, 3 has beautiful graphics and sound design but the gameplay feels crappy in comparison. None of the enemies do attacks that would appear natural, making them extremely hard to read and hard to predict what they're gonna do next, which I guess is the point, but as someone who only has an hour or 2 a week to play games, I don't have the time to sit and learn every enemy's attack patterns, or remember what I was even supposed to be doing after not playing for a week. Pushed to get past Wolnir, forgot what I was supposed to be doing or where I was going, got wrecked in the city after the crypt area and gave up on the game. Sad I won't be finishing it, but I really can't be f#cked to load the game back up.",0
Negative,This games frame rate is honestly the worst its fine at some points then it slows down to a legit crawl. I know it just came out but this isnt a very good start to the 3 game. I will continue to play but its hard to when i fight a boss it goes down to about 10 fps and when just running around 50-60 fps. Then when you go to firelink you run 23fps all the time every time. I'm sorry to say but stay away for now.Overall if you can get this to run or can play past the bugs then go for it i love the series and have loved it. Honestly Fromsoftware will fix it but this needs to be pointed out now. The game is graphically pleasing and is honestly lovely. Also changing from high to low does nothing but save me 2 fps. As i have now been informed and have tested this works better on my integrated graphics card wow lol. PsThis review will change with time and fixes but stay away till fps is fixed.,0

Negative,"Maybe my least favourite DS game, beaten them all DS1, DS2, & this with max achievements, but damn this was a grind to finish with some poor design. Ridiculous enemy spam and stun lock, making some of the regular mobs harder to fight and kill than the bosses. Poor frame rates on a high end PC.

Negative,"Same as DS2 as far as general gameplay goes but a bit of a downgrade I reckon with several features removed like bow infusion, armour upgrading, torch lighting and pvp is terribly implemented this time around with no opt out. Areas aren't as well designed either.Usual souls style of no story/lore ingame which is a bit disappointing although expected. Still no quit to desktop option either.I'd say get Dark Souls 2 over this if you want something from the souls series although if you're just after souls-like game, go for Code Vein.",0
Negative,"Game is just fan service for hardcore DS1 enjoyers. Miyazaki went above and beyond to make this game everything that people hoped DS2 would be except worse.

Negative,"Sadly, PvP is completely broken these days. 8 out of 10 invaders are either twinks, laggers or cheaters (or all together). And that's not an exaggeration, but real numbers from an experience.Years ago, it was way better; but nowadays you can easily find ways to abuse the gameplay online, and devs don't seem to care at all.

Invaders coming at you with max gear and 20+ healing, while we only have 4. absolute garbage. All invaders are trash and i hope every one of you get cancer in the ass",0
Negative,"Plain truth is I just suck at this game. It is waaay too difficult. I've died over and over again fighting the first two bosses, never beat them.

Negative,The art and environment are well done but the combat is clunky and tetious at best. The progression system is incredible slow and uninteresting. If youve ever played a game and fought a specific enemy and thought to yourself. This enemy is super annoying and not enjoyable to fight. Im going to ignore it and go back to the fun parts of the game. thats every enemy in this game lol. To sum it up overall its a large amount of time and effort for no rewards other then to tell people you played the game.,0
Negative,"Arena is the closest form of balanced PVP. I don't think the game mechanic of invading was intended to be as it is right now. You spend most of you time waiting to invade. 1/3 of the time this gets canceled due to timeout error before you actually arrive in the world, 1/3 of the time there is an error once you arrive in the world, or 3s later the host starts the boss. Seriously Fromsoft? There is 5 seconds prior to invading, 5 seconds of loading and you actually make people come to worlds were the host is 10s away from the boss?If you actually arrive in a world, you have more chances to be against a gank squad than to be in 1v1.The offline design to achieve the 100% achievement is the ensure farmers full-time occupation for months. It's such a smart design.",0
Negative,"For the sake of equilibrium - 1/10, there's really enough spitlicking sycophants greasing the Miyazaki hypetrain already. What really gets to me is the fact that there seems to be one department tasked to turn every otherwise stunning looking environment/biome into one big, HIV-infested shithole after another. Either by placing poison /toxic sludge everywhere while not even giving you the chance to equip gear to overcome said impairment (Rusted Iron Ring, where?) or placing ridiculous mobtypes on chokepoints - or both of the aforementioned conditions. DS1 felt challenging but rewarding from the beginning to the end. Skipped DS2 because it looked like the wrinkled back-end you'd imagine on Lothric Castle Emma.This time however, everything feels worthless. Skip Armor, Skip + to loading weight and resistance, because the shit they've placed along the line will kill you anyways.

Negative,"No simply bcs of invasions existing in co-op. Don't care about being ""casul"", can beat ds rather easly, save for super fast huge/knight type enemies, tis the pvp that gets on our nerves. Not only just want to co-op and there are forced invasions (literaly game is multiple times easier when playing offline), but most importantly, invasions waste our time, can't progress bcs they will get in the way, can't fight them bcs they hide behind mobs, less than 1/4 of invaders is of our actual level/skill/gear level, had a pleasure of being 3 shoted multiple times on high wall of lothric. with just caestus or whatever those gloves are while them taking like 40-50 damage only and their healthbar being something made of like 1,5k. Most invaders have fully upgraded estus flasks so they can heal and heal, some even didn't ever ran out of healing even after half hour+ of beating them, today even met a guy who would take no damage from host, he would also not target us, the only damage that took from them was from their aoes, otherwise they just hunted down phantoms then waited.EDIT: Half of theinvaders that getting now are invulnerable to being hit by any means other than phantoms but still taking damage from them, is like, the further going into the game, the more glitched it becomes in terms of mulitplayer.Another EDIT: Finished the game, eventualy solo as had sincererly enough of invaders wasting our time when reached half of lothric castle. Some enemies and bosses cheesed with range or glitches bcs playing the game for fun, not a secondary school of when is safe to strike once in the constant onslaught of attacks from poise god knights or bosses with infinite stamina. Feeling bad that considering self a good, quickly learning in games and adapting player but was not patient enough for this to do it melee and oh, the magic sucks in this game, same with bows. Champion gundyr, lothric prince, soul of cinder, nameless king, slave knight gael, halflings (and later propably fredie and whatever else breaths there) were impaled by rain of crossbow bolts, with lothric being cheesed by the no agro glitch on stairs bcs devs decided to screw over anyone who isn't using ultra or penetrating weapons as the only way to win that boss is killing the small prince which only drops down for 3 seconds after killing the big one which ressurects, pontif was cheesed by phantoming him, yeah, tbh coop and to some extent npc phantoms take away from the experience and in some ways also make the fight worse (such as useless sirris and orbeck for lothric fight, both dying on first, maybe at the start of second phase and leaving a health/damage boosted monster boss to solo), gael could propabl fight without cheese, almost won against him but ran out of estus at the end and just wanted to win and being a filthy behind shield turtler that is scared of hitting in risky moments and waiting for perfect time when enemies run out of stamina so he could deal considerable damage by chiping thro with elemental damage so just did the first phase normaly and the other 2 with bolts. Soul of cinder also, npcs for first and most of second stage then bolting for finisher.The vanilla game is mostly fine, save for the multi enemy gangbangs, especialy in later stages of the game, is very fun to get staggered to death and whatnot and also enemies have. actual poise, player doesn't have poise, is a meaningless stat that is truly only working if using special few abilities or ultra weapons, the devs suck ultra players so hard they propably are now impotent, the game is basicaly about either fast straight swords or ultras (best choices), other weapons are also viable (a casul beaten it with just a basic halberd and a shield for entire game), it doesn't mean they are good choices, fast weaposn doesn't need to care about poise bcs they are. fast, if got into fight with a fast enemy or with invader using short weapons, welcome to the stunlock, they don't need poise, however they fight for the ""best"" position with ultras which have poise when attacking and ultras are basicaly either be a dodge into backstab or parry pro or be able to trade with them. So yeah, being anything other than those 2 like a middle ground (such as halberds/spears which trade speed, poise and damage for range) is just gimping self, also players don't get staggered when hitting shield with fast weapons, amazing. Another thing are enemy humanoid npcs that were given the roll ability, there's no way to hit them, best would be ultra poising thro them tbh since npcs won't stop attacking unless being out of their range so easy squash for the ultras. Last thing, infinite stamina enemies/bosses, also rare like the poise and gangbang and roll gods in vanilla but still exist, any type of a knight other than wall lothric knights and cathedral knights will just perma attack untill out of their range, red eyed lothric knights?, perma R1 R1 R1 with sporadic stance finisher that goes thro shields, thankfuly they can be staggered., just like the pontiff knights which are considerably much less spongy thank gods, but vanilla have things like darkwraiths, worse silver knights. and the worst of the kind, black knights, black knights could propably even resist an ultra with their poise, srsly, past champion gundyr there's like 5 of them with ultra greatswords and on top of that a shield, they are harder than the boss himself. (ah, also forgot about the ascended winged knights, as if one wasn't infinite stamina/poise enough, there's 3 of them, had to bow them down)Another thing, ranged combat, wish things, especialy the pathetic damage crossbow/bows would be fully homing on targets like in teso for example, why?, bcs roll exists, roll exists there too, but rolling takes so little stamina. can even just walk to the side and those things become useless, extremely situational weapons, especialy bow which roots player when drawing the bow then slows to a crawl while also slowing stamina regen and have to dual wield it. for like 20% more damage over a crossbow?, pff, don't get started on greatbows, those things are just some invasions montage material at best. Spells also, mana doesn't regen, healing is almost useless bcs if being almost dead. wanna heal now and can't heal in mid-combat bcs of oraoraora enemies, all of them so gotta drink estus, damage spells are almost all not homming like arrows, easly rolled away from every single of them and on top of that if wanna see damage that an ultra can do with nothing but 40 str and dex then have to waste all ring slots for magic damage boosts, a weapon of choice for damage buff like staff or standard or something, possibly a head slot for super ugly helmet if using sorcery, 60+ in int or faith with high dex to cast quickly. on top of every other stat to not be a squish then spend big chunk of mana and even then they propably gonna roll away unless will succefuly trade damage.Also wish there were more bosses like dancer or abyss watchers, their themes are cool, their fights are not infinite stamina bs etc (gundyr kinda too, but the champion version have infinite stamina so screw him, some ugandan soldier with supa kickas), even soul of cider was kind of fun or gael (which is from dlc).Gonna include dlc ratings, also negative in separate reviews since ran out of space here, dlcs are like, pure sweaty tryhard evil, it already takes a sweaty, perfect rolling, melee only, naked, sl1 pros to finish vanilla in end game with no cheese (there are literaly ppl who did entire thing with 0 damage taken or beaten things like midir first try)",0
Negative,"TLDR: if you enjoyed the previous souls games where you had to position and space yourself appropriately in combat depending on your build and playstyle, and what enemy you're fighting, do not buy this game. 90% of the PVE combat is reliant on rolling through an enemy's 3-6+ attack combo and then punishing with a roll attack. gone are the days of spacing, movement other than rolls, and identifying good blindspots in an enemy's moveset to stick to, outside of a tiny handful of specific rare attacks. If you liked bloodborne or sekiro style dodge-and-parry-based combat with fast weapons, then you may enjoy this game.fromsoft has yet again made a game where: the characters are good, the writing is good, the music is good, and the atmosphere/art is great, but I must ask: what the FUCK did you DO to the COMBAT god DAMN.Slower weapons are gimped hardcore in this iteration of souls because of how most bosses attack fast, and often in long, drawn out combos, with some touch-of-death true combos thrown in for good measure. This, coupled with more enemy damage across the board, near-perfect attack tracking from enemies, and weaker armor options both in resistances and poise, makes anything short of a straight sword, katana, curved sword, or spear practically unuseable on ng+ and up, and a hit-trading slogfest in ng where you'll regularly get punished by most bosses and enemies for attacking LIKE YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO during an opening. Assuming you use any medium/large weapon, you'll be seeing yourself winning boss fights with no healing left, IF the game decides to give you good RNG in that attempt by not having the boss counterpunish your slow recovery every time you attack an opening. The only boss that I enjoyed in this game was nameless king, because his first phase played like a dark souls 1 fight where you could figure out blind spots and timings to run in and out of attack ranges and position yourself to deal damage while being safe from retaliation besides one or two attacks, but then phase 2 starts and most of that gets thrown out the window, becoming yet another roll-through roll-attack one-dimensional slog (though there were two rarely used attacks in phase 2 that rewarded spacing and smart movement, so they did at least try on this one.)fromsoft is just trying way too fucking hard to make everything bloodborne-style combat, not realizing that souls is not built for this kind of thing unless you remove all the slow weapons and shorten the roll queue time. I cannot tell you how many times I have both died to, and seen other players die to, an attack that they mistimed a dodge on, which causes that dodge to get queued and immediately performed out of stun, and FORCE them into a death from an enemy's delayed followup attack. You can't just port the roll buffer straight from ds1, a slower-paced game, and expect it to work well with no changes. The attack buffer has this same issue, by the way, but you likely won't be pressing that when you see an attack coming in.If you're fine with only being able to use medium/large weapons for PVP and small, easily stunlocked enemies, or you're fine with summoning phantoms to pull aggro for you so you actually get an opportunity to attack without always being counterpunished, then by all means, try this game out. after I finish this game, I'm probably never going to replay it again, and only use the one character I have for pvp, but then again, even dark souls 2 does that better.Side note, I've noticed that elden ring plays practically identically to this game. It is very likely that elden ring will have the same identity issues where fromsoft tries to make a souls-style game and force a bloodborne combat pace on it, and combat will largely boil down to ""roll through attack, roll-attack, repeat"" with the occasional enemy that requires delayed rolls. large weapons will likely be unuseable against most bosses in solo play unless these new jump attacks are fast. fromsoft, this is not the way. your artists, modellers, level designers, etc. do good work, but holy fuck you need new programmers and gameplay directors, or you need to hire more playtesters, cause I'm legit confused as to how you managed to regress souls combat to basically be a 2 button game (roll, light attack), when ds2 was supposedly more rushed than this and yet made the combat BETTER.addendum Post-DLC: all the bosses in these DLCs are closer to a ds1 experience. what I mean by this is that they have movesets that can be beaten with a combination of clever movement and careful observation of what angles the bosses' moves cover, also there are no moves that come out faster than you can realistically react, unlike some of the base game bosses. it was actually pretty fun. I don't think it's a good idea to pay full price for this game just to fight the DLC bosses, though, and it may not be worth slogging through the base game just to get to the DLC.",0

Negative,"Dark Souls III seemed like an interesting, challenging game. I was looking for a multiplayer game to play co-op with a friend so we gave it a try. After playing only 3 hours, I realize this game is not for me.Multiplayer sucks all my fun away. We can't progress through the second area without getting invaded. I just got this game, I'm a noob that just wants to enjoy the game with a friend. Apparently, that is not possible because you HAVE to put up with players invading you if you want to play co-op. Online forums are full of people defending this mechanic and I understand that some enjoy might it, but I also don't see any reason why there can't be a PvP toggle option. It makes no sense to me and simply leaves me frustrated. Who cares if that makes the game optionally easier? At least I and many others would be able to enjoy the game. Bottom-line: If you like hardcore PvP or you are looking for a challenging single player experience, this game might be for you. Otherwise, look elsewhere.",0

Negative,"I'm going to be straightforward with eveyrone. Darksouls 3 is a great game, just not for the PC. Hacker check. this game is overpopulated with hackers and the developers really aren't doing much to resolve it. Don't misunderstand me, not everyone you come across will be a hacker. Some players are really good and have spent hours perfecting their playstyle and then there are hackers. I've encountered some hackers that just don't care and outlandishly cheat in a way that is absolutely ridiculous, and then there's the dirtbags who cheat and try to pass themselves off as good. seasond players know what I mean but let me explain. Some hackers are so cheap that they alter their stats to have things like extra defeinse or attack. some individuals will do unlimited stamina, my all time favorite is preventing death. That's right, taking so much damage then preventing their health from reaching 0. So it's only natural for players to get banned after being reported that way the rest of the player base doesn't have to suffer.I wish it were true, but that same hacker that invaded your game two days ago is still invading in the same area and crashing your game, and sending them into an infinite death loop. Without video proof of the hacker in action, it takes a massive amount of reports before steam will look into it, and even than theirs no guarantee that the hacker will get vac banned. so either get gud at alt F4 or deal with it.Ok, maybe not deal with it. again the game is great! I spend hours it and every time I learn something new and find a different way to kill other players without the use of hacks or cheats, but hackers kill the game. Fear not because DS3 is on multiple consoles and on consoles, they perma band hackers, and cheaters. So buy at your own risk it is your money, and if you think its worth hours spent dealing with hackers and cheaters then fire away or avoid pvp and being emberd which kills part of the game its self.",0

Negative,"Quick:1/5. More disappointing nonsensical eye-candy masquerading as a deep, meaningful, fair, and challenging game-play experience; Dark Souls 3 is yet another disheartening descent into the franchise. Hoping against all hope, and interested in seeing what so many other people adore from this IP, I have once again, against my own judgement, journeyed into the realm of questionable design and antiquated game mechanics that, in this instance, are commonly justified by a theme. This game is better than its' predecessors, yet so similar in all the wrong ways, that it only reinforces my previous criticisms, and confirms my suspicions that the core game-play loop is broken. or at least idiotic. This entire franchise is held aloft by talented artists, writers, animators and musicians. all the while, being subdued by gimmicky and goofy game direction. This game, Dark Souls, and Dark Souls 2 are not good games. In fact, they kinda suck. Time will inevitably confirm this. These games will not be played by new generations of gamers, and looked upon fondly.More:The artwork, animations, music, and lore of this game are amazing. When you step into a new area, and look around, you will be often captivated by the beauty of this world. Enemy designs, specifically bosses, are so outstanding that it's worth dying to them just to get a good look at them, sometimes. There is so much about this game that I recommend you experience. However, there is infinitely more about this game that I wish dies and never returns in any game ever again. I hope that everything that has to do with the game-play of the Dark Souls games is eradicated from gaming as a whole, and becomes rightfully ridiculed in the future.At every turn, you the player, will be tricked while playing this game. No. I do not mean to say that you will have your expectations subverted. I mean to say that you will be tricked by the developers. In more ways that I can even remember, now, I found myself thinking. ""what in the f*ck was that?"", while playing these games. Enemies are strategically placed to get the jump on you all the time. Bosses have moves with timing so strange, and awkward, that you will have to reprogram your brain to anticipate how things in our universe move. There are traps, and surprises around almost every corner. so much that you begin to roll your eyes while anticipating them. Enemies constantly mob you, swarm over you, and attack you repeatedly, denying you a chance to retaliate or get away. You will find your health bar reduced to a sliver by an enemy move that you have no idea how to dodge. Curses, toxins, poisons, and a myriad of other status effects will pop up from time to time, diverting your attention from the main objective, and forcing you to backtrack, or navigate a clumsy menu to fix what ails you. This game should not even have weapons in it, because you're incentivized to just run past every enemy in the game, until you find the next bonfire. This is always the most efficient way to play, and the least enjoyable. Why would a game developer make a game less enjoyable to play on purpose? This game is sh!t, and I will not be devoting anymore time to this franchise. Dark Souls should have been a movie or a TV series. not a game.To quote one of the best game designers of all time, Sid Meier. ""Often, when a game's not working, we will ask, well. you know. who's having the fun here? Is the designer having the fun?. or is the player having the fun?. or is the computer having the fun? You know. if it's not the player that's having the fun at this moment. then something's wrong."" No one is having fun in Dark Souls. Something is wrong. I've never had one moment of playing these games that was fun, in any sense of the word. The only part of this game that I liked, was exploring the world, when not being chased or attacked by enemies. Rare as it may be, it is enjoyable. but not fun. If I was playing chess with someone, and I didn't understand the rules, I would feel the same way that I feel when playing Dark Souls. Imagine that you think you're putting your opponent in checkmate, after sixty iterations of play and you think that you actually know what checkmate is. only for your opponent to inform you that he or she can switch the position of their king and any of their pawns on the board when they're in checkmate. because they're playing with the black pieces. That feeling you would have, after being told this. after investing time into the game. after planning a strategy around the rules that you assumed were correct. that's the feeling of playing Dark Souls. The feeling of being tricked. Everyone has an innate sense for betrayal. That sense will be tingling the entire time you play this game. If you've ever had a friend that thought their pranks were the funniest thing in the world, and they performed them so much that you became irritated while correctly predicting them. then you've probably been friends with one of the developers of Dark Souls.This game is all about not explaining to you what is really going on, and expecting you to conduct a trial and error exercise repeatedly to finally make your way through it. Dark Souls was not created with the player in mind. It was created to stroke the egos of developers, and to hijack your reward centers in your brain to trick you into playing, and thinking that you're having a good time. Why are the stats that you're leveling up not explained in-game? Why are the covenants that you join not explained in-game? So much of this world is just not explained. which is fine from a lore point of view. but not from a game-play point of view. I should not be guessing what stats do, and what symbols on the stats screen mean. I should not be wondering whether or not joining a covenant will change something critical to the story-line or not. This game is a joke. It is a fad. It is a gimmick. It will not stand the test of time. People tend to consort with raggamuffins and no-gooduns who are in no way a benefit to them. When you ask these people why they bother with the dregs, they often respond with something about how the person makes them feel. The socially marginalized has the greatest social perspective. Meaning, the person on the outside of a relationship has more perspective on the relationship, than either of the two involved. because they're on the outside. I watch people who play Dark Souls, and claim to love the game. and I want to ask them. ""why do you keep doing this to yourself?"" There are better games to play. Other games that will respect your time, and not trick you into wasting money, are everywhere. Games that are actually fun. are everywhere. I want to say things like. ""You deserve better."" but I don't say these things. If they want to play them. so be it. However, I do take umbrage with the act of spreading the notion that these are good games. They are not. If you want to play them. fine. But, don't drag the rest of us into your world of meaningless horror, and waste our money, to bolster your opinion that you're doing something worthwhile or fun. You can date or befriend your deplorable miscreants all you want. but don't introduce him or her to my friends or family and expect me to not sound the alarm. Dark Souls, Dark Souls 2, and Dark Souls 3 are garbage.",0

Negative,It seems like they put the minimum effort into porting this to PC. Very frustrating to play at times because of all the clunkiness in the KB+M controls,0
Negative,"Coming from DS1, I find the design of DS3 to be inferior.1. Low boss variety. There are three duel-wielding skinny bosses; dancer, watcher and pontiff. Many humanoid bosses, and very lackluster, plain, vanilla, final boss (who the hell is this guy). Pales in comparison to Gwyn's aura and presence, because the entire DS1 is built on his story, so players know they are facing the legend. DS1 bosses, many being huge monsters, have more presence and feel more intimidating.2. Bad bonfire placement . Many are within walking or even viewing distance from each other. Appearance of bonfire after a boss defeat feels redundant. Loses the feeling of finding a haven out of a long and risky journey. It would be much better if every area has at most two bonfires, with one just before the boss room.3. Weak map design. DS1 again has more variety and feels more grandeur. Valley, forests, demon ruin, Lost Izalith, Anor Londo, Sen's fortress. Just compare the scope of Smoldering lake to Demon Ruin, or the DS3 catacomb with Nito's home.Overall, I'd give DS3 a 7/10. Still recommended to Souls fans but I'd suggest you play DS1 if that's the only Souls game you are gonna play.",0
Negative,"Dark Souls 3 on the PC is probably the worse I have played in a long time. I've heard great things about the Dark Souls series. But the PC is just a direct port from Xbox version. Your given instructions on the tutorial on how to play with an Xbox controller when your playing with a keyboard and mouse.Secondly, trying to change the key bindings to play the game is hectic. Two many functions for one key such as sprinting/rolling/etc. Not being able to change it where I can have one function to one button wasn't working out for me.The graphics and quality of the game may be good and the level design was great but overall the ease of using the controls ruined this game for me.If you plan to play this game, use a controller. It may work out better for you.",0

I don't mind the game being crazy difficult, we were expecting this, but when you're trying to get through story with a buddy it's disheartening to have a random person come in and literally slow walk at you because you can't hurt them and kill you in one hit. Every time one of your team dies, you have to go through the summoning thing again to rejoin your friend. You can't play co-op with your buddy without constant harassment and you can't just LEAVE the invader and go someplace else. Uninstalled, got a refund.",0

Negative,"I've been a die hard fan of this series since Demon's, Dark Souls 1 and 2 were satisfying and memoriable. Dark Souls 3 is just beautiful and recycled. The boss fights are harder with added mobs and broken patterns. Every f#ckn door you want to open doesnt open, and every summon doesnt summon. Not a matter of being salty or ""get gud brah"", its just broken. DS2 introduced new game mechanics (also from part of the DLC's) and completly new lore and world to explore, great armour and weapon designs, and kept the same spells settings. DS3 just seems uinfinished as you re-explore a ""DS1 remastered"", and weapons skills are only intriguing and limted to difference. There was a huge transition on changes and new introductions to gameplay from DS1 to DS2. Everything that was added has now been taken away in DS3. You can upgrade your weapons and sheilds which remains untouched, but you can not upgrade the most important factor of all, your armor. Many things arent carried over from DS2 which is a shame.Heres a rundown on what DS3 didnt carry over from DS2 and should've kept or at least expand a little more:- hex magic- new spells from DS2 that where either replaced or not added into DS3- ability to reduce the stat requirements of spells using spices- killing an NPC and resummoning them via gravestones and still talk and such- Pharros' lockstones- soul vessel- puzzles and platforming mechanics (such as the pillars in the Sunken King)- knocking down trees, breaking walls with firebombs- All new armor, shield and weapon designs (I may sound critical, but DS3 boss soul weapon and most greatswords almost all look the same and do the same skills. As for armor, DS3 recylcled many sets from DS1 and only the Farram set from DS2)- Rings, +1 and +2. This is can only be acquired from new game + and ++ in DS3. For the matter it wouldve made sense to have kept the Bonfire Ascetic, but that didnt carry over.- PVP arenas- PVE based covenants such as Pilgrims of Dark- Dual weilding was stat based, meaning you can dual wield any f#ckn weapon you want. - You can infuse boss soul weapons, such as fire infuse a Thorned Greatsword (already with a base lightning infuse)- The Bell Keepers- Life gems- Twinblades and Reapers and Lances. DS3 kept the reapers class, but only three scythes. And one lance. - A REAL epic dragon boss fight.Dark Souls 3 is a good game, one that expands on nostalgia and lore of DS1. But gameplay wise, its very linear. The only difficulty to the game is being overwhelmed by enemies with an endless supply of stamina and unsteady, unpredictable patterns. Poise stat is unbalanced and not working. Althouigh fan service is satisfying, I dont feel it being appreciated in this third installment.",0
Negative,"If you're a casual gamer, avoid this as it's pretty much halo 1's ""the library"" on legendary for the entire game. Be prepared to memorize every enemy location, and map layout after attempting to complete a level 30 or so times.The user interface is clunky and non-intuitive, the npc's flat and utilitarian. This is not an RPG, it's an action game. Know what you're purchasing here, I'd compare this to kingdom under fire, the circle of doom where the story was superficial to just wacking things with a new weapon; except everything can one shot if you miss a dodge or parry due to stun lock.For those who don't care about traditional RPG elements, there's a robust weapons system as dark souls has this in spades. Be prepared to grind however as the 'side quest' system is convoluted and highly conditional per playthrough if you missed certian events. The game offers no aid in terms of where to go for level layout or how to progress. It's very hard-core in that sense that there's no hand-holding, so new players will find themselves looking at walkthroughs by others to figure out what to do.If you enjoy the 'figure it out' and 'pure combat' aspects, then dark souls excells in that area above, and at the expense of all else. Just be prepared for the old-days punitive failing as opposed to the modern 'failing forward'. Also expect to lose hours of 'work' upon death if you can't reclaim your souls; so spend them early and often.",0
Negative,"My review will be negative until they fix all of the game's crippling performance issues.FROM software said that if you could play Scholar, then you could play DS3 just fine. My FPS in Scholar was constantly 60, yet in DS3, it drops down to less than 10, depending on where I'm looking!DS3 even auto calibrated my settings to high, indicating that I SHOULD be able to run the game effectively at those settings, yet the game still suffers terribly. Even when all of the settings are changed to LOW, the performance doesn't change! This means that there are serious problems originating from the developers, and that they must be fixed before you consider purchasing this game.Stay clear for now.",0
Negative,"This game was nowhere near ready to be released yet. Multiplayer is almost entirely unplayable. Other players appear to have no animations whatsoever and instead glide around the world and stare at enemies until they are dead. Crashing at almost every bonfire due to lighting bugs.

Negative,"The latest and greatest in the Dark Souls series is still unfortunately mired in FromSoftware's unique brand of incompetence. A boring combat system and intentionally frustrating level design make the game a chore to play from start to finish. It can be summed up as walk/roll behind an opponent and mash R1 till defeated. Occasionally, you'll need to raise a shield as the devs have opted to use attacks which can strike behind or immediately to the side of the enemy character (150 ~180 ) in order to compensate for this glaring design flaw.New to the entry are enemies so large they take up the entire screen. Yes, the age old FromSoftware problem of an odd and uncooperative camera makes a grand comeback in Dark Souls III, now with the issue of being unable to see much of anything at all! Early on it's some kind of odd goo creature emerging from common enemies, much like the mid-fight change of the first boss. Later on it's just very large creatures which jump all over the place, break your lock-on, and attack relentlessly. Speaking of, if you want to know the greatest improvement between DS3 and Sekiro it's the enemy stamina bar. Yes, the absence of other players ganking you in the middle of play is a very welcome change but your enemies not swinging relentlessly while your stamina bar slowly depletes or you attempt to roll away only to find yourself caught on some piece of terrain has the incredible ability of making FromSoftware's boring combat tolerable!And as they swing, of course they could never do any damage to one another, only ever to the player. Not only is the combat implicitly not designed for a melee of more than one enemy at a time due to the block feature only accounting for a rough ~35 area in front of the player but more importantly due to multiple enemies swinging through each other and blocking the player from moving around some obstacle or another. On exceptionally rare occasions the enemies will be designated as antagonists and can damage one another, most often when small mobs are a part of a boss fight.All of this critique neglects the very apparent acts of intentionally griefing the player as designed by FromSoftware themselves. Most notably in this work are the archers on some parapet or roof relentlessly firing arrows towards the player: The later you get, the worse it is. There's still the age old and tired, ""watch out for that pit, oh the enemies knocked you into it, lol,"" nonsense that made DS2 the worst in the series but not as much as before. All in all, Dark Souls 3 is a boring, simplistic game whose only challenge comes from the enemies high damage numbers. Cut them in half and this is an easy game with a lackluster combat system and convoluted mechanics. Is it worth your time? Not if you have anything else to doIs it worth your money? Maybe ~$10 for everythingRating: Very poorIf you want a third-person action game with a lock-on system, difficult combat, and an excellent story give NieR: Automata a try.If you want a better FromSoftware game with similar mechanics then I would recommend Sekiro. It might only be a 60/100 but it's much better than this mess.",0

Negative,"Game won't run in 21:9 resolution. There's a mod that supposedly fixes it but that didn't work either. Nor did editing the .exe with a hex editor. Avoid if you have a 3440 x 1440 or 2560 x 1080 monitor.Edit: I finally got the game working in 21:9 with the Souls Unsqueezed mod. It was a hassle but it worked. Now the main problem is the game itself. There is no mode for playing co-op with a friend that doesn't involve getting ganked by player killers. Very disappointing and unenjoyable.Edit 2: I don't play the game online otherwise and here's a great reason why: A friend of mine nagged me until I went online and embered in order to fight him in PVP. While waiting for him to put down his summon sign, I was force-summoned to someone else's world without any option to deny or refuse, and then forced to accept multiple items with names like '?GoodsName?' and icons that were just a picture of the red words 'TEST DATA.'

Negative,"Dark Souls III is one of the best entries in the series, beautiful visuals, remarkable story, and exhilarating combat. I 10/10 recommend you play it. But not on Steam (PC), the game heavily favors consoles in the realm of support and features. For example, THIS GAME DOES NOT SUPPORT STEAM CLOUD SAVES. Such a basic feature is still missing if you plan to play this on multiple computers or switching between your Steam Deck and PC that's NOT (I understand as PC players we have work around's) going to happen. FromSoftware makes great games, there's no questioning that, but they also tend to rest on their newly found laurels, they lack support, they take a long time to fix errors and bugs and treat PC customers as second-class citizens. Even on the console side they tend to favor PlayStation over Xbox. If you're looking to get into souls and PC is your only option, try Dark Souls Remastered, if you have a console get it on console. If you love to tinker and none of this fazes you, great! No worries here, just be careful because even the slightest modification or self-fix can & will get you banned.",0
Negative,"This game has great visuals and a cool concept but what made me not like the game is the limited mechanics and controls the game offers. For mechanics, you can only do light or heavy attack and dodge in combat, maybe use an item to make your weapon do slightly more damage. The controls almost made me stop before I got to the end as the camera can go crazy on some boss battles and the lock on is very lazy as it will quickly stop locking on as soon as you move a little away from an enemy to heal. I understand why people can enjoy the challenge this game offers but for me I want a little more variety and better control.",0
Negative,"Bandai seems to lie about what is a ban-able offence and how long a ban last I tried to change the controller icons from xbox to pc and got ban, the ban seems to never lift.",0
Negative,"I own all three games, and though I desperately WANT to like this series, I just can't seem to.For me, it comes down to my character, not the enemies. Swing a weapon, and you will find yourself doing so much slower, and with a lot more vulnerable paralysis than you will in almost any other game. You feel sluggish. Your parries and dodges have to be perfectly timed, and you also have to dodge in the correct direction. I play a game like Dragon's Dogma, which has enemies that are also impossibly large, have wide, sweeping attacks, and move quicker than the player. But it's a lot more fun because my character is more responsive. If I die, it's because I made a mistake, not because I was waiting for my character's animation to finish so I could do something again.But worst of all is the stamina. This game is all about resource management, as stamina is used up in everything you do. Attack, block, dodge, run. And once it's gone, you can't do anything. So on top of trying to fight, you constantly have to keep one eye on your stamina bar to make sure it doesn't go too low. It's just not fun.The 'difficulty' comes from the fact that you frequently face opponents with very wide hit areas in small, cramped spaces, that once you get hit, you are absolutely PUNISHED for it, frequently combo-locked until the enemy is done with you, and can be hit repeatedly before your character has even stood back up. It also comes from the fact that enemies respawn if you even look at a bonfire too long while thinking about whether its worth it to try and use it to heal up. You die, you drop all your souls. You die on your way to get those souls back, they're gone forever. You get a pitiful amount of souls for rather difficult enemies, requiring you to farm repeatedly, with the constant risk of death. And you will often fight the camera, and find enemies that will jump out at you with an attack from vantage points your camera can't possibly see, or who are in areas you may not be able to reach if you don't have a ranged attack.All of that does indeed add up to 'difficult', but difficult in the way Ninja Gaiden for the NES was. That game, too, was very difficult, as every time you tried to jump over a pit, a bird would fly in to try and knock you down it. It's a very cheap-feeling style of difficulty. And let's face facts: Exactly zero people enjoy farming. People program bots to get out of doing it. This game requires it, and requires a LOT of it.Bow and Magic take a back seat to Melee. No matter how you build your character, you won't be anywhere near as effective as a melee brawler is. This severely hampers what initially appears to be a wealth of options down to one: Melee character with bow/magic support. And that's a shame, because I dearly love a bow, but everything from the severely limited lock-on range to the rather shoddy first-person cam on the longbow shows that ranged combat was pretty much an afterthought in this game.Have a controller, because while this version is FINALLY playable with a keyboard and mouse (only took them three tries to make a proper port), it's certainly sub-optimal.I have tried very, very hard to like all three of these games, but I just can't. My biggest regret is that I didn't learn from the original, and kept thinking they would get better. It's really just more of the same as the last two.If you still think you'd enjoy it, wait for a sale with a steep discount.",0

Negative,"It's ok, I played it through, did every boss, got gud etc etc. It was average. It's 'console-hard' plus 80s game design. Pve is just a)fighting the sucky ass camera at all times and (b) repeating the boss until you remember all his moves, just straight up rote repetition.The fov is set to 43! One level is all monsters with human heads and bug bodies, the next level is bug heads on human bodies. otherwise its mostly skeletons, zombies and poison blobs. Its just odd and eventually boring.The art design has no actual theme or reason for it because there's no actual story. There's bits of lore on all the weapons etc you pick up but even with that it doesnt really explain anything. Just look at the wikis, its mostlty peoples interpretations from the disjointed bits and pieces. There are like 8 quests total and none of them have any sort of markers. explanations, introductions, or official rewards. You'll pick up a ring or a weapon or you'll miss it and the 'quest giver' will die and you'll get to loot them for their armor or something.I mean I got all the quests done because I went slowly and with wiki on a tablet to maKe sure I got everything. I even got the 'good' ending which is a 2 second cutscene with no dialogue, exposition or anything else. I still have no idea what is going on or why anything is the way it is.",0
Negative,"1/10 Game doesn't know what it wants to be. It's a terrible mix of Bloodborne and Dark Souls. It took all the great aspects of both games and tried to combine them into a great one but failed to give any kind of forgiveness for mistakes. Before you say git gud, I have NG+7 character on both first Dark Souls games. This game felt disrespectful to my time, every single encounter is spam roll to get out of a death combo or get nearly one shot. Combat was way too aggressive and felt really unrewarding. 1000 health fells like it's meaningless.",0
Negative,"The soulsborne games are masterpieces of level design and story, and Dark Souls 3 is no different. It's an excellent game with difficult, rewarding gameplay and a rich plot with plenty of side quests and hidden areas. There are a bunch of walkthroughs and boss tutorials online that should help make it a challenge instead of an exercise in futility for new players.That said, when playing the Steam version, it's very clear that this game was designed for console and really, REALLY wants you to at least use a controller to play. The tutorial area in the beginning has all of the controls and tooltips listed for an Xbox controller rather than a keyboard. The game gives you the option to hook up an Xbox controller an Xbox controller to play, but if you're like me and prefer mouse and keyboard, you're pretty much out of luck. I had to look up how to change weapons because there is now right trigger on my keyboard. If you want to play on more than one device, which is the main reason the PC version of any game is better than console, imo, you're screwed there too; this game doesn't have cloud save. I had to jury rig a way to create a Google Drive folder that contains my character info, then tell every device to draw from that file rather than the normal save data. And yeah, this works, technically, but it also crashes very often and is almost unplayable.In short, this is really an exceptionally good game, especially if you like a challenge and memorable boss fights, but it's also the laziest port of a game I have ever seen. I got it on sale for $15 and I'm still insulted they charged that much for such a poorly made Steam adaptation. If you're really interested in this game, either get it for console, or be aware that you're in for a more than usually difficult journey.",0
Negative,"Like all of the Dark Souls games this is excellent. The main game is brilliant. The DLC is great. At the time of release I would have given this a glowing review. However, that was then (when the game worked perfectly) and this is now.when it doesn't work, and hasn't for quite some time.I bought it upon day one, and was making good progress. Almost finished the main game, one piece of the DLC, and was making progress with the second DLC. Then I had to restart it all, and as I was getting my butt kicked I stopped playing it for a long time (about a year and half passed till I tried it again). When I eventually decided to start it up again.it does the sum total of sweet FA.Every time I try to load it, it just twiddles its thumbs for thirty seconds and then dies on me, and I haven't found any solution for fixing this. Not everyone is affected by this problem, but I can't really recommend a game where it's a crapshoot as to whether it will play or not. When the publishers / developers don't bother to sort it (and by now never will) and there isn't a fix or a mod to get it working, then you could be wasting your money.With steam refunds you'd have nothing to lose if it doesn't work, but as someone who had made a fair bit of progress through all of the content it's rather annoying that it's now useless. So a negative it is!EDIT: I should clarify the difference between the time of review, and the time of playing. For the best part of, I'd say, two years, this wouldn't work for me at all.Then, for whatever reason, it began to work, but I am permanently banned from online play. Despite never actually doing anything wrong in the first place. I cannot summon anyone to help me now, as the means for reversing the bans has long since stopped being active.With this issue remaining I will not change this to a positive review.

There are often 2 bonfires in a row even without any mobs between them, you have to walk 10 meters to reach 2nd.4. Enemies are animeish (no in a good (Jojo) way).4. It is EXTREAMELY easy and short. New game+ is easy mode. Bosses are trivial.5. Target locking system is horrible, if u lock on someone and make a step back (or he does) you loose target.6. If u slowly step back most of enemies will miss with EVERY attack.7. NPCs have ALMOST NO dialogs.8. Network: often phantoms are not animated at all and don't get any damage from enemies.9. Most of game mechanics are now adapted to be used by degenerated ppl. For example, roll gives you INSTANT invulnerablity even if it is a fat roll, if you come from back side of enemies you will do backstab almost always.TL;DR: Slightly better than DS 2, but a horrible game.

The world looks amazing, bosses are very good designed and the combat is decent enough.The only reason why this game recieves a downvote from me is the fact that From once again pushed out a poorly optimized game.

Now its only 25% consisting of mainly AMD users which still get lag from hell due to their bad job on optimization.Intead of working on a patch to fix the lag for the rest though, they push out balancing patches for weapons or the overall game.After the big banwave they actually started working on a serious issue, which is good. The ban-hackers have to be dealt with. Yet that is no excuse for the time before.We are one month and a few days more in and the game is still unplayable for most AMD users, including myself.I am forced to play on 20-25 FPS on any resolution or graphical setting with heavy stutters.,which forces me to play offline.

When I contacted support, they told me that if I was banned, it would be permanent, without considering the circumstances or the fact that it was due to a hacker.

You get killed so often if you don't learn the battle dynamics, the camera angles can really suck when dealing with multiple enemies or a large enemy. There is no story to this game. You just go around completing stages and cut scenes don't really have any depth. I think the hardcore gamers love the challenge but if you're not that serious, then this game might not be for you.",0
Negative,"Great game, but some major problems like the anti cheat, if you play offline or play when steam is down,as it does happen from time to time, and you make decent headway you can be flagged as cheating and the great multi player game goes to single player only. Couple that with the fact the publisher will not unban you even if your saves are deleted and your game is reinstalled. They have zero interest in working with you to solve any problems. I would suggest you dropping your 60-85 dollars elsewhere, as I myself will not be buying another game made by disinterested developers that have zero customer service. Sadly I did spend the $85 for the deluxe, don't make my mistake.",0
Negative,"still trying to understand why they randomly decided to put an ear piercing loud scream into an empty room, this game is supposed to be somehow better than DS II and idk on what planet that is true on because the only metric this game exceeds at is amount of weapons to pick up and even then, most of the PvE isn't susceptible to the cool things those weapons do, it's still FROM and so it's still way better than a Soulsclone but this is the worst thing these devs have ever released between now and 2009 this game is so bad i refuse to even dignify it with punctuating this review",0
Negative,"After The Ringed City and thousands of patches later. I don't recommend this game. Because Fromsoft caters to whiners and casuals. When it used to be Git Gud, Fromsoft nerfs everything.

Negative,"Few Games come with co-op, but the co-op in this one, specifically with a friend leaves a lot to be desired. Stranger dynamics are slightly better.The story is that I get invaded constantly by cheater modders and the game does not facilitate quitting, but the devs punish you for it, threatening you with bans and inability to connect with your partner. The game facilitates these cheater kids who have gotten bored with the normal gameplay and just are looking for PvP constantly, overwhelm you in numbers, presumably the rewards for it are completely worth it. The game is destroying its storyline and fairness and fails to consider PvP consent.The game makes my partner very weak, even if we aren't even getting invaded, and the lag on his side is very high, as he's probably joining a closer server to me when he co-ops with me. Definitely not a game for co-op with people from Nz, Aus from what I read and gather.",0
Negative,"If you're like me and played Elden Ring before this, you will be extremely disappointed. Essentially, Elden Ring is Dark Souls 4. Huge portions of this game's mechanics are copy/pasted into Elden Ring, which sounds great, but unfortunately it took them 4 games to get it right. -You can't level up at campfires. You need to fast travel back to base to level then fast travel again to get back to where you were.-Campfire placement is awful. I need to fight 20-30 units to get from the nearest campfire to attempt the boss again.-Trash mobs have a confusing risk reward balance. There are special units around that are often more difficult than the bosses in the same area because of the area you need to fight them, but these special units don't drop anything. Why are they here?-There is no map so exploration is deterred even if you want to explore.-The jumping mechanic. just wow lol. Have you ever seen a cooking show where the judge will say if you messed it up don't put it on the plate? They should not have a jump mechanic in this game. It's that bad and serves no real purpose. For some reason it reminds me of mount riding in Diablo 4.This is sitting at like a 6/10 right now for me, but maybe that will go up with more play time.",0
Negative,"Well, I gave this game a try, despite my experiences with Dark souls 2, and I am disappointed in DS3.To the loyal Dark souls fans; I probably won't convince you to not buy this game as you've probably already bought and enjoyed it, but I can tell you that you should still get the Watchdogs mod if you want to PvP or remain offline. The hackers still seem to be an issue, even after 4 years. I'm sure the hackers have calmed down a bit, but it's still getting downloads so I'm sure it's still relevant.To anyone who might consider buying Dark souls 3: Know that the game has a lot of issues, even compared to previous games. Therefore I cannot recommend buying this. Try Dark souls 1 instead, it also has issues but isn't as immersion or game breaking.Here are some of the issues I encounter in Singleplayer: The character creator is bad.It's a ported game.Game has input lag and queuing.No PC control tutorials.Unfair balancing, even for a souls game.Enemies hit through walls and other enemies.Every room is a trap, which gets annoying rather than challenging.Lack of direction (good and bad).Multiplayer issues (PvP and Coop), I only tried coop and got ganked once: Coop matchmaking isn't good and is like that as a design choice in all souls games. It's much improved since DS1 and 2, as you can get a password to only summon your friends. Though, it's still needlessly difficult as story progression is not shared like in most other games. So you'll have to go through the levels twice if you want to progress together.Gankers are everywhere, especially after a sale, and the PvP balance is atrocious. If the ganker is an experienced DS3 player, he would have already gotten all the best weapons and armor. This isn't skill based, it's literally just pushing two buttons and winning for them. Not saying that beating them is impossible, just saying only a DS3 veteran can beat a DS3 veteran. Which is honestly not very fun and ruins the coop experience when that happens.DS2 and DS3 has a hacker problem. There were hackers in DS1, but they weren't as malicious as they are now. In DS3 they can literally ban you from playing PvP ever again, by giving your player character vast amounts of souls and extremely powerful equipment. It's the game's way to stop hackers, which can remove non-hackers too. It's completely ridiculous and shouldn't be happening. Yet it has been happening for 4 years and is still happening.Even with all these negative points, there are some parts of the game that are good.Positives: An interesting grim dark story.Interesting characters.Amazing looking armor and weapons.Cool and expressive animations.The world looks great.Fantasy setting.Structured RPG system.Final statements: I didn't play the game for long, but I have known the warning signs from playing Dark souls 2. It seems to revel in being unfair for the sake of being unfair. Dark souls starts off the game like that, but the game isn't defined by it. Dark souls used to be games that reward skill rather than pure knowledge of the game, which doesn't seem to be the case for the early game in DS3. Even DS2 had a level of reward for skill!I can still understand why people like the game, but I simply don't like it and can't recommend it because of it's many issues.",0
Negative,A very bad port from console to PC. All the tips in game reference controller buttons and no not match the keyboard settings.,0

Negative,"Is a game worth my limited time? (Trigger Warning for fanboys/girls) This is a question I have to ask myself every time I want to buy a new game. When I looked at Dark Souls 1 a while ago, I asked myself the same question and bought it, although I was worried it might disappoint me because of its difficulty. What I got was a great RPG with an amazing interconnected world and tactical combat that made you think and learn every time you made a mistake. Sometimes it killed you, but most of the time you had a fair chance of getting out of a bad situation. It wasn't over until it was over. With Dark Souls 3 things drastically changed. Instead of an open world, I got linear level design, a less complex story and a more action oriented R1-spammy approach to combat. Every mistake was immediately punished with death and a 1-3 minute walk back to where you died. The walking was the same and sometimes even worse in Dark Souls 1 but in that game it didn't happen so often, and I always knew what was the reason for my death. Dark Souls 3 has many weaknesses in comparison to its predecessor, but the most glaring issue for me was its way faster combat. The thing about DS1's difficulty was that it punished greed and carelessness with damage, resource loss and sometimes even death. It wasn't meant to be super hard, it just became that way because of its mechanics. DS3 on the other hand was made with the intention to be super hard. Often it felt like the developers saw the ""DS is so hard"" memes on the internet and decided to just focus on that instead of an overall good and fair game. Every enemy has some superfast out-of-nowhere attacks, which are not only super deadly, but also super unpredictable. This made combat much more frustrating than it should have been, while at the same time didn't add anything good or fun to my experience. It was just difficult for the sake of being difficult. This issue became more obvious with the bosses of DS3. DS1 had some amazing, some ok and one very bad boss (Bed of Chaos I hate you forever), but they were all manageable. The reason why that was the case is, because they gave you room and time to observe their moves. Even the faster bosses like Artorias or Gwyn left the player with enough time to think about their next action. In DS3, mainly because of its fast combat system, this is not the case with most bosses. You either react correct instantly, or you will most likely get one-shot to hell and back. They rarely expose themselves to attacks, and their combos last so long that you will eventually make a reaction mistake and immediately die for it. Where Dark Souls 1 was about resource management and learning from your mistakes during the fight, DS3 because of its superfast combat is all about reaction speed. You die, and then you learn from it (or not) which makes the fights more frustrating and annoying than they had to be.After I finally (after 12 attempts) beat Vordt of the Boreal Valley, I only felt exhausted and was in a bad mood. It wasted so much of my time that day that even the final blow to Vordt did not feel any good. I was just tired and shut down the game. I carried on, seeking for the fun in the rest of the gameplay, but it did not come. Instead, the village area made me realize what I hated about the exploration gameplay in comparison to Dark Souls 1: the normal enemies. Nearly every enemy in DS3 is capable of killing you within 1 to 2 hits, and it was designed to be this way because it had to be ""SuPeR dIfFiCuLt"". While this was also the case with some elite mob in DS1, the normal foes you encountered in the first game existed mainly to test your planning and resourcefulness. If you got hit, then it rarely meant sudden death. You had to use a healing item, learn from your mistakes and move on. If you get swarmed, it was probably your fault and you would learn from it. In the village area of DS3 there are 3 enemy types that are specifically made, to kill you: the mages, the saw dudes and the pot dudes. Their attacks are so fast, unpredictable and strong, that one hit most of the time meant stun lock to death. Getting killed by these mobs often without a chance of attack stunning or evading them, I got so demotivated to go on an exploration trip that i usually just ran straight to the next bonfire to skip these enemies. Then I reached the icy-sword-hand doggo in the basement below the big elevator tower. It was yet another very strong, very unpredictable enemy that was just designed to check if you could react fast enough. There was no planning, no resourcefulness needed to kill him, just reaction speed. AGAIN.This was the moment when I realized that I did not enjoy or will ever really enjoy any part of the game. So I quit the game and uninstalled it and I don't feel ashamed, but relieved. To all those who now shake their heads and say: ""you are weak"" or ""git gud"" I reply: I easily beat DS1 so no, I am not weak. I just don't enjoy the game. I understand that many people like the more action oriented, fast and reaction based combat in DS3, but I don't, which is why Dark Souls 3 is sadly not worth my limited time.I give Dark Souls 3: 55/100 (most points go to graphics, animations and the fact that it works as intended)Hope I didn't trigger any of the elitist DS3 players.Darken0id",0
Negative,"While I've enjoyed the previous Dark Souls series for its cooperative elements and occasional PVP, Dark Souls 3's implementations have completely ruined the game for me. This is a terrible game to get into as a new player or anyone who wants to get into it for cooperative gameplay, with the lack of a small soapstone in this game regaining embers (humanity/effigys in DS3) is very difficult and limited early on. The lack of soul memory allows low level characters to be easily equipped as a twink. As a run through with my first character I kept track of a majority of my invasion fights; don't be fooled by other reviews or threads regarding pvp. The game would be so much better, PVP included, if there weren't so many people trying to newb-bash.Play this game if you enjoy being killed by:- Permanently invisible greatbow users who nearly oneshot you from the rooftops within your first two hours of the game.- People with three times your hit points and twice as many estus flasks uses as you, oh, and their potions full heal them while you have to drain all of yours to full heal. - People who like to swap between five different boss weapons with different augmentations to bypass your shield through the course of their epic tumble-and-estus circus-clown battle with you and your starting gear.- People who are there to troll you. Not only with their superior equipment and estus flasks, but with their endless supply of consumables and ammunition, they'll lolligag around near the big monsters in your area to prolong a stalemate until you get bored and try to push for progress.- A community of people who want to add you on steam to trashtalk about how you should 'git gud' because you only have five hours with the game compared to their five hundred.- People who really like gymnastics.

Negative,"Crash Souls 3 is a memory leak/crash simulator. It is advertised as the sequel to Dark Souls 2 but is clearly meant to be satire as I was actually able to run that game longer than thirty minutes before a major crash.

Negative,"I want to love this game, but I can't.

Negative,"Basically the Star Wars reboot of the Souls franchise.It's a huge letdown that they brought the action oriented combat from Bloodborne to the Dark Souls series and transformed it into a fast attack spam fest.Gone is the poise and risk of enemies trading with you and coming out on top, now you just R1 spam like a room temperature IQ people-person and win.If you ever wondered how someone can have thousands of hour in TF or Train Simulator, this is me with Dark Souls. I am very passionate about Dark Souls and have well over 1000 hours in the first game and hundreds more in the second, played the rest of the series too. I was very active in pvp-ing (dueling, twinking, invading) and cooping (summoning people and being summoned). Attempted speedruns and a huge variety of builds (from Pyro SL1 to fist only or the standard Quality or mage build). I think this somewhat makes me knowledgeable about the series.While Dark Souls 2 tried many new things and it succeeded with some, failed with other, Dark Souls 3 really does not try anything new and sticks to the familiar characters, lore, world and feels like a huge pander. And this is the point of it all, it has become a pander to the ""hardest game ever"" and ""so many deaths"" meme brought by casuals and journalists and they artificially increased the difficulty by increasing the number of enemies while one on one feels very easy due to the already mentioned R1 spam stunlock. Meanwhile bosses are a joke with just either strafing to the right while hugging their balls or figuring out the gimmick and easily doing the ""puzzle"" fight. Only few stand out (Nameless King or Soul of Cinder)They also show that they do not understand their core hardcore audience by punishing build diversity and PVP. 1. Invaders basically being at a huge disadvantage and 2. offering a lot of buffs to summoners. Meanwhile weapons feel the same and R1 spam applies to PVP as well, so there is no reason in ever going with anything slow and heavy hitting, when straight swords stagger just as well, are faster and have around the same attack power. I must admit that I did not participate in many ""fight clubs"" (as we call duels in the community) in DS3, but that was my experience with random invasions.The first play-through on release felt very satisfying, but then you realise that ""that's it"". No more looking and theory crafting builds online to bring them to lower level invading or duelling . No more thinking what your next run might be, because you'll just feel like you intentionally ""gimp"" yourself by going with anything but a Straight Sword R1 spam quality build. If you are someone that plays this as a casual and just goes for 1 playthrough of each entry in the series, this will be a good game for you and it will be fine. If, on the other hand, you really are in this for the love of the series, I can't really recommend this as this will disappoint you. I am very sorry that the series peaked with Dark Souls 1 (and 2 for pvp) and stayed there, never surpassing the legendary standard the first Dark Souls has setup.",0
Negative,"Played the 1st and didn't like it, but people kept telling me this one is SO much better.It's not. It's the exact same, the player character feels unnaturaly sluggish, with all of the stamina of an overweight, asthmatic 90-year-old. Playing a spellcaster is still not viable, since doing anything but attacking in melee locks you in place for ages and mana doesn't regenerate, making it no different than ammo for a ranged weapon.If you liked Dark Souls 1 this game is for you, I assume, though I fail to see the appeal.",0

Negative,not as good as other souls games,0
Negative,"Pros: The artwork is stunning and the game is overall beautiful.Cons: This game has a reputation for being difficult, but the reasons behind its difficulty are honestly just frustrating and not enjoyable. Save points are inconveniently placed and so far from boss fights that you end up having to sprint past enemies over half of the map to get back to the boss that you WILL die 10 times fighting. Difficult combat is not something I would be upset about on its own, but with save points 30 minutes apart, at least, you end up with a sense of relief at not having to play the same stretch of map again rather than accomplishment. Also, I was very disappointed with the combat mechanics. For a game that is entirely a melee combat game, the combat itself is clunky and not very varied. There isn't as much rhythm to the fighting as I had hoped, it really ends up amounting to ""spam dodge, wack with sword.""",0
Negative,"It doesn't surprise me, really. FromSoft had a great thing going with DS1, and instead of just improving on it, they throw the entire thing out and make DS2. DS2 actually ended up being pretty okay, but why fix something that wasn't broken? Well, they repeated the process with DS3, and unlike DS2, DS3 is garbage.Level design is great. Monster design is great. Some of the bosses are even pretty decent, though most are garbage. I can't speak about the lore because DS3's obsessive edgelord focus compared to previous titles turned me off in a hurry.But the combat is just fucking terrible. Instead of realizing Bloodborne is its own thing and should stay that way, they tried to marry Bloodborne with DS1 and the result is a goddamned mess that has none of the strengths of either system, but many of each system's weaknesses.Worse still, there's very little authentic difficulty to be found in the game. Instead, it just heaps tons and tons of monsters that are hideously overpowered and some that just outright cheat and calls it good. This is a lot easier to make than balancing monsters appropriately, which isn't surprising considering they're shoveling a game out every single year. Quantity over quality, for sure.I just gave up after 25 hours. I kept waiting for the game to be fun, and it just never happened. There are too many huge issues that are part of the core gameplay and therefore aren't something that can easily be remedied. not that FromSoft or Japanese developers in general are known for doing much of anything in regards to fixing things post-release unless it's packaged with DLC (like DS2's Scholar of the First Sin upgrade.)I very much regret buying into the hype and pre-ordering this, and wish Steam had a more lenient refund clause so I could get my money back. or at least give my copy of the game to someone that will actually enjoy it. DS3 will be rotting in my library alongside the other poorly-made games. FromSoft clearly doesn't know what they're doing anymore.",0

The amount of third party software, fixes, mods and IT gymnastics that I have to do just to let me play this game with a PS4 Controller, with PS4 button prompts, borderless windowed, with uncapped FPS /AND/ to not have it crash every 5 minutes is insane. How can anyone slap a price tag on this and sell this? This is first time I am playing DS3 after 100% Dark Souls Remastered (which I loved, and just because of the technical aspect alone, I would recommend over this piece of shit) and honestly, while I can see how much improved the gameplay, UI and everything is in here, the technical aspect makes me hate this fucking game. If FromSoftware cannot release games on PC (other than the Dark Souls Remastered, which I believe was touched up upon by a different Polish developer even), then they should stick with consoles. What the fuck is this.EDIT: Oh and that is nothing to say about how they deactivated the online part of the game.

Not much practice and no method of leveling up before the first boss was brutally punishing and I was very close to just returning the game at that point. However, I did make it past and went through most of the content in the game. The enemies were varied and interesting with challenges throughout. However, the end boss was brutally challenging for no reason and not that interesting. And totally lost interest after the ending. Congratulations on beating the game, now play again.

It just feels off to me.That may be me alone but I've pocked around some posts here and there and that doesn't seem to be the case, yet we aren't that many to not really feel it.As to why, err, I'm not really really sure. I have game design experience but what I feel about this game is too subjective, or I may be too inexperienced, not sure either. I just feel bumped down.Maybe it's a mixed feeling of not really achieving the idea of separating the community from this game, which can be both the most precious thing that can exist and the most toxic thing that ever struck humanity. Maybe it's a feeling of feeling cheated by PvE that sees way ahead of your actions. Maybe it just boils down playing a mage and being too stubborn to change. A mix of everything.Try this game still.

Every second I've spent playing this game is another regret I'll have to confront in the final moments of the lost potential I used to call a life. There is no redemption for me and it all started the first time I launched this game. Curse you from software, curse you Bandai Namco, and curse every person that has even had the smallest amount of association with the creation of this tragedy of a game.",0
Negative,"The game is great, as a Dark Souls game. As a fan, the game does very well. However, there are big issues:1. Framerate drops, are semi often and VERY jarring. Apparently has something to do with saving game files. I run at 60 FPS and it plummets to 1-2 for a split second, which can mean death at some moments. Very annoying. 2. Poise is broken, there is a poplar post on the community forums right now, where players have found game files indicating poise has been turned off in the game. This was likely a last minute call on Fromsoft end and gives the game a fast pace Bloodborne combat feel. This is fine, but makes heavy armor builds pointltess and ANY enemy with ANY weapon can stagger you. PVP is very frustating aswell where fast weapons with good reach are very unfair to face. Once you get hit once, you will get it over and over. You really have to be on point with dodging.3. Soft banning players. this is a huge deal. Fromsoft has pretty much soft banned half their player base at this point if reading reedit and community forums are any indication. Like me, and many others, completely unwarranted. This oddly splits the community where soft banned players are now playing seperately to those who avoided the ""ban wave."" Online play is completely borked because of this, and I may suggest people avoid buying the game until this is fixed. Not to mention, the warning messages nerely instructs you to delete your save file or risk being banned - which many people have, and Fromsoft goes around telling us deleting the save file will do no good. 4. Magic balancing issues, in the past magic builds have been an easier alternative to melee builds for people who just are not on point with dodge timing. This was fine in the past games, but they went ahead and made magic completely unviable - at least in the early game. If you want to play a caster, don't bother. Weapons regular light attacks will do more damage than a slow casted spell, and every boss has an aggressive gap closer. This is pretty interesting as Fromsoft has stated difficulty was never the point of Dark Souls. so why nerf magic to near uselessness? New players who pick a caster starting class have to be having a hard time with this. Once again, this is not Bloodborne, allow us to use magic from the start to the end of the game. 5. NG+ is pointless. It was never the point in other souls games, but here, its literally just to get rings which give you a very minror boost to overall power. No new enemy placement, bosses are all the same. You get some red phantoms, whoohoo. You are better off just starting a new character with a new build. I understand the game is still getting updated and patched and a lot of this will get addressed, but we are WELL into launch at this point, not to mention it was released in Japan prior - which is another thing I take issue with. Take it for what you will, the game is good and I'd rather play over most other games, but god they manage to screw up very obvious stuff in these games.",0
Negative,"I do not like this game, but I would not go so far as to call this game bad. The main reason I don't find it fun is attributed to the fact that the bulk of the game play involves a loop of roll, attack, roll, attack, roll, attack, roll, attack, and so on with little variety in effective strategies for taking enemies down. Sekiro does a much better job with allowing more maneuverability, parrying, and tools to make the game faster, and more varied, but this is not why I do not recommend the game for general consumption.What drew me to the game were theme and enemies since I'm a fan of dark fantasy settings, I also quite enjoy many of the weapons and armor, but the reason I do not recommend the purchase of this game is due to the fact that the mouse and keyboard controls are astoundingly awful, for a AAA company especially. There is no excuse for the menus to simply not recognize that you are using a mouse and keyboard, and to not display the proper prompts for them. Absolutely no excuse for a PC port to include such dreadful and lazy mouse and keyboard controls that the game hardly provides any indication as to which controls do what, and to make using a mouse and keyboard the most anti-fun and clunky experience I've had in a PC game. Its not the most difficult step in the development process, and they could spare just a small amount of their millions to implement it properly, but their brainwashed fanboys will attack anyone who asks for it, so the developers do not feel in the slightest bit obligated to do so. I don't care if you think the game was never meant for mouse and keyboard controls, its on the PC now, and that is a function of the PC. I should not have to buy a controller if I do not own one to play a game I bought for my PC because the developers decided to come out with a PC version of it but did it lazily since they can rely on their loyalty blinded fans to worship them and attack all requests for a proper PC port.",0
Negative,"Really disappointed . I kinda thought, since I bought the game on Steam, the game would actually be somewhat converted to PC . but ALL tooltips are for console, nothing gets properly explained and the controls are cumbersome and annoying. In a game that relies so much on doing the right thing in the right direction at the right time, these controls are just terrible.I kinda wonder how everyone else was able to play that BS - do you all have controlers to do it like you would on console? Or are you in fact playing on a console? Is there Steam for console? I might just be too much of a PC gamer, but for me, these controls are just BS and I regret buying that thing .",0

Negative,"Oh dear, another controversial review. I'll quietly put this one next to my Dark Souls 2 review, so that I can put my cards on the table.Dark Souls 3 is a sequel to Dark Souls. It is also, ostensibly, a sequel to Dark Souls 2 something the fans and developers seem to find far less appealing. Just about everything related to the previous game is gone, scrubbed so completely from the world that I initially thought that this game took place before Dark Souls 2.It's a recurring theme with this game. Poise, an integral mechanic from the previous two games, has been completely removed in favor of a super armor mechanic with the same name. Armor is less useful, and cannot be upgraded. Heavy weapons and magic have been nerfed heavy weapons in terms of functionality, and magic in terms of sheer numbers. Dual wielding has been simplified into the floor. A generic mana bar replaces magic charges and allows for unique weapon skills, which likewise oversimplifies many of the unique weapon movesets. Multiplayer mechanics have been tipped far in favor of co-op over the presence of invaders. Areas are very neatly designed to call back to classic Dark Souls areas, making them feel repetitive and uninspired. The list goes on, and on, and on.It's like the game has been flattened. It's still a Dark Souls game, but that feels more like a surface-level connection than anything else. And the worst part is that across the playerbase, I don't think very many people were bothered by the changes at all. Recent reviews are at Overwhelmingly Positive, for goodness' sake.If you've played the previous games, you can probably pick up this game and have a fine time. You can probably play it for much longer than I did without getting bored. To be perfectly honest, you probably won't even notice most of the mechanical changes depending on how you play the game. But that's not me. Not recommended, for personal taste.",0
Negative,"Probably the Weakest entry of the Souls Series. Abysmal level design coupled with putting too much emphasis on the weakest part of the Souls Series, the combat, make the game a slog to play through without much fun sprinkled in.",0
Negative,"Pretty sure no one will read this, but here goes nothingPeople have been saying ""Oh man, Dark Souls the hardest game ever"" and crap like that, and I finally got to play dark souls 3. I was expecting it to be a ton of fun because of what I've heard, and it really disappointed me when I played it. Basically the enemies attacks are like freakin magnets - doesn't matter where you dodge, it's like they know where you're going to be at the end of your rolling animation. Another thing is with their attack animation - some are obvious but some are stupidly hard to read, like I'm attacking the enemy and all of the sudden that same enemy somehow counter-attack me while looking stunned, which is very confusing. The biggest thing that makes me dislike this game is how it's basically a hit and run game - because you literally can't do a combo of some sort without getting hit by a bullshit attack animation you can't see.So yea, those are my complaint - I mean this game is pretty good, but I just hate how bullshit it is. I like the classes and the many different type of weapons and armors you can have, and also how you can't use the bonfire everytime to restore your health after you clear all the enemies because that respawns the enemies again. But - again - what I really dislike about this game is the hit and run tactic that YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO DO in this game - and that's quite boring for me.So yea. if you got to the bottom of this boring review then gratz or somethin",0

Negative,"Many of the negative reviews for this title focus on optimization, online issues, and similar problems. However, I haven t seen many of these reviews delve into the overall experience, so I decided to write this review as I have a somewhat unenthusiastic view of this game.I want to preface this review by stating that my dislike does not come from me not being gud. As you can see, I put a lot of hours into this game I completed the base game + DLCs, and defeated all the main & optional bosses. But even then, I have absolutely no love for this game. From the beginning, this game was merely an experience to play a hard game for once (I will discuss the difficulty shortly). However, the primary reason I lack any fondness for this game is the absence of a clear story.If you want to learn more about the world and the lore, you have to read all the item descriptions to even begin understanding the story s direction. The game makes no effort to provide at least a simple main story, which would help players start piecing together the world s narrative. Their more recent game, Sekiro, does a much better job at this than any of the Souls games, mainly because it actually cares about presenting the story in a less convoluted way. Obviously, there are players who enjoy reading and exploring every inch of the game, and that is fine. However, having a simple main story would not detract from the experience of those players and would enhance the enjoyment of players like me. This is why I say I have no love for this game I don t have the time or patience to sift through numerous items to understand just a small part of the world, so this game ends up being a challenge of roll, attack, kill for me, with nothing more to it. (Quick note: ask any Dark Souls fans about X or Y lore, and they will surely tell you, but ask them how they know that, and in 99% of cases, it s because they watched a 10-hour lore video on YouTube).Setting aside the issues I have with the story presentation, there are a few things I want to discuss regarding the gameplay, one of them being the difficulty. Although one of the main reasons From Software s games are popular is their difficulty, I don t think Dark Souls 3 is particularly hard, except for a few bosses and some random enemies. My issue is with how this game is balanced. VERY often, you will find that those random enemies take longer to kill than some of the bosses. It would happen quite often that I would defeat a boss in 1-3 tries, and then there are normal mobs that absolutely destroy me after fighting them 10 times. I do believe this is not entirely bad, as it makes exploration more exciting (you are always somewhat anxious about what kind of strong monster might be in the next area). However, I do think it s either a bit overdone, or the easy bosses should not be that easy (looking at you, final boss).Another big thing that I dislike about the overall gameplay is the existence of hidden walls. Miyazaki, please, for the love of God, stop doing this. I genuinely believe this to be the worst game mechanic in their games, and the reason is simple: banging against every single wall is NOT fun. There is a certain amount of excitement that comes from discovering a hidden path, but I do not believe that hitting your head against every single wall, causing you CTE, is worth that dopamine. If From Software does not want to remove them (they still exist in Elden Ring), then a small fix would be not hiding important stuff behind those hidden walls. Put like 5 Embers in there or something, but instead, they hide actual important stuff, like for example one wall having an entire boss behind it as well as an item you need for one of the endings.Speaking of hiding stuff in obscure ways, there is an entire area + two bosses hidden behind you having to do an emote in a specific place in the middle of a road. Just why? There is no way more than 10 people discovered this without reading online forums. If any single player game makes me check the wiki for progression or something as important as this, then they have significantly failed.As for the positive aspects of this game, honestly, I don t think this review needs to mention much. From Software is one of the most beloved companies nowadays, and there are plenty of good reviews on Steam that highlight the amazing aspects of this game (gameplay loop, combat, boss design, music, scenery, etc.).In conclusion, I believe that Dark Souls 3 is a good game. If you are one of those people who doesn t mind reading all the item descriptions, or watching half a day long videos on YouTube, then you will probably love this game (love, not like). However, if you are like me and don t have that amount of time or patience and see From Software s games as roll, attack, kill experiences, then just go and play their best game, which is Sekiro. My thoughts after completing this game are that I did have a good time, but at the same time I think to myself I would have preferred to spend that time playing like 5 indie games.",0

Negative,"Dark Souls as any other ,sadly too much disapointment for me personaly.Can't recomend it ,feels rushed and unfinished ,they are counting on too much nostalgia inducing locations ,NPC's and such and tottaly changing the lore making the previous ones that started the series absolite,meaningless and pointless.Game play wise yes is Dark Souls lore wise .is some nonsence.Not to mention that the online interactions didn't improve in fact right now is even worst than the previous ones sadly.I may reconsider my rewiev if they do something on thouse isues which knowing how well they handled previous tittles ,well you can say i don't expect that to happen ever .Excuse my english is not my native language.And they still refuse to do sale on the DLC's.DLC are maybe better,then the actual game,tho it didn't fix my issues with the story,it actually made it worst.",0
Negative,"- update at 2024-03- game world look good- game just disconnected and logout when I was fighting with BOSS- as I progress the game, I find out more trolls that developers put in game than challenges to make player die on purpose- of course they won fix the tutorial key display cause they don't care about PC gamers- update at 2020-06Why the tutorial only show the controller buttons instead of keys when I was playing on PC?Maybe they didn't care about PC players.I don't think it's fun to be killed over and over again. Enemy attack is so deadly which will kill you like 3 hits. So if you want fight to the end, you need understand every enemies attack and make no mistakes. It means you will spend lots of time to try and die. It just not worth it.",0
Negative,"G.R.I.N.D.That is all.Jk. If you want a game where you can get chewed up and spat out, this is the one for you. Levelling up means seeing the same maps, same character models, trying the same moves (except just before this, or just after that (this time) over and over till the game wearies of seeing you and lets you pass.I like games. But I don't like grinding. Eh, Ymmv.",0
Negative,Why does it seem like i bought the console version of this game? It wont go into fullscreen mode all the prompts are for a controller! IDK i've never have had this happen from a game purchased for here before! i really wanted to play this game smh!,0
Negative,If you have a controller - I am sure this is a tough but fun game. With a keyboard and mouse - save your money. I have wasted my money on bad games - but never on a game with bad controls. Don't expect a refund from Steam after two hours of trying to figure out how to make the controls work for you. Steam is a great company - but they have lost my business.,0
Negative,Re-purchased on PC. Constant early-game invasion by end-game players makes this not worth playing. A shame.,0
Negative,the invasions in this game are damn near broken constantly getting hit by attacks that are no where near me they should not give the advantage to the invader,0
Negative,only problem i have with this game is the controls still suck if your using KB+M. There is no way to change stuff to were it is not all on the same key so it will end up fucking you over more times then you can count. Example. fighting a boss need to hack and slash him to kill him right? well to fucking bad for you that your going to randomly KICK the boss to brake his shield guard that he doesnt have and do NO DAMAGE but still waist your stam so then you get ass raped by the boss because you cant dodge or block now. OR hey there are bad guys with shield that you have to kick to brake block and then attack. TO BAD FOR YOU its all on the same key and RANDOM when its going to do it so you can just get fucked.,0
Negative,"As someone who adored DSR, I hated this game. It's not a bad game at all. The combat is slightly more fluid and the customisation options offer much more variety. In addition, some bosses are pretty cool. However, x3 more enemies in each area, the excessive amount of ambushes and traps, at least half of the chests being mimics and so on make this game easily overwhelming and even, annoying at some point. It feels like this game is solely made for people to rage on Twitch. When it comes to the original fanbase in the era, the game provides tons of fan service mainly from the first game even though according to the lore, it takes place many years later. However, even this fails to save the day.",0
Negative,I should have read the negative reviews. Game sounds great but YOU NEED A CONTROLLER. It's quite possibly the worst keyboard/mouse port in the history of gaming.,0
Negative,"A lot of invasions are now just hackers and you can only have invasions off by being not embered or playing in offline mode. Either way you cannot summon helpers. Being embered also gives you a +30% hp boost, so having to go without that would really stink.",0
Negative,YOU ARE FUCKING IDIOTS I HAVE PAID BEFORE 3 YEARS 60 EURO FOR THE GAME I HAVENT PLAYED FOR 2 YEARS AND SOMETHING I LOG IN NOW AND I HAVE BANN FOR WHAT REASON?. IM TRYING TO CONTACT SUPPORT TO UNBANN MY ACCOUNT AND THEY DONT ANSWER ME FUCK YOU BANDAI NAMCO,0
Negative,"DLC is good, base game is not. 1-2 cool boss fights, other than that random mobs have bugged hitboxes, boss fights are too static and the map designs are just doodoo. Overall, the game is okay, but not worth the hype for todays' standards. If you like ""oldschool"" games, go ahead. Otherwise just play ELDEN RING or Sekiro instead.",0
Negative,"I don't understand the hype around this game franchise. There's no fun gameplay, it's only scare jump and memorising path/pattern. Please, don't tell me that you find it fun to roll 90% of the time.I had less trouble killing bosses than the first mob in the game. They are easy as fuck because of their dumb hurtboxes and you can predict easily what they will do.The gear/leveling curve is dumb as fuck. There's no feeling of upgrade. Yes i know, there are some build when you reach lvl32403++ but between the early and end game you can't do anything interesting. Armors are useless. What an exciting choice. Will i wear that +5 def armor with that +15 weight or will i wear that +0 def armor that weight nothing? Well, i'm going naked because it makes 0 difference, i'm going to get two shot anyway by that undead farmer.The game just wants to frustrate you and when it succeeds you die again and again.People will say ""Get gud"" but LOL there are bonfire everywhere. If you beat that game it's not because you are good, it's because you had the patience to beat it.I'm not wasting my time anymore on that.EDIT : In fact i've wasted my time a little bit more, i'm at the final boss right now, i've done everything but the DLCs, and that didn't change my mind.It's worse than my first review. The input buffering made me table flip. It's at least 30-40% of my overall deaths. Seriously, ok i got it, i won't button mash anymore but 3sec buffering is insane. Who thought it was a good idea to do that ?The only OK tier thing about this game is the level design and the scenery. I won't talk about the lore, i wasn't curious enough.TL;DR : Pure garbage. Don't buy. Even at 11 like i did.",0

Negative,"You fight the camera more than the monsters. Specially with mouse and keyboard. Figured they would have learned since the last game. I was wrong. Also full of other bugs, glitches, controller issues.Just check the forums for a convenient list.Some of the main issues is that they removed poise yet left the stat and items in the game for it. After last patch everyone experiences a .5-1 second freeze every few minutes. Range of longswords out rangers greatswords. Auto summon covenants not working. Theres a bunch of stuff. Just hit the forums and you'll see all the shit people are complaining about. They already got our money so it seems like they really don't care to fix anything. They just say it's working as intended.",0
Negative,"I am still playing it, but so far it feels so much worse than Dark Souls 1 or Elden Ring",0
Negative,too hard :sob:,0
Negative,Dark Souls 2 is better,0
Negative,"I've had this game for quite a while, and I remember, watching streamers play it before I started playing it. But I never came to it because I didn't like the game and the enemies. Games like this are made to make you rage and break controllers and keyboards. Because it is not difficult to the point where you have to be better at the game, it is difficult to the point where you literally can't do nothing and then with luck and a miracle you might kill the boss. Not because you got better because you got lucky. I am speaking from experience of playing games and understanding how games are made and why are made in a specific way. I am not joking or anything and in my opinion this is one of, if not, the worst game that I've ever played in my life. You start in impossible first level when the game is walking you through to learn the game. LOL First enemy is the warrior that when it turns to a snake it becomes impossible, I can do it if I waste 12 hours of my life trying to master all his moves and how to dodge them. But why? after it imagine what there is and even harder enemies. imagine the last enemy of the game! Again, the worst game that I've ever played in my life that has been made to rage players and waste their time. Now I know this doesn't mean anything because this is a very old game. But I just wanted to give my review for the first time trying it. And for maybe future buyers who knows.",0
Negative,"Fromsoft in their infinite wisdom decided to remove poise, so now you can get stunlocked to death with knives while wearing heavy armor. If you ever want to use a heavy attack or a sorcery that takes longer to cast, you will just get interupted 9 times out of 10. Victory or defeat just comes down to who gets the first swing. If you want to play a good game just go play dark souls 1.",0
Negative,Does not have ADP. (Dark Souls 2 moggs this game to the grave)Second to worst build variety in all souls game (Dark souls 1 takes the price).all other positive reviews are gonna be cope.,0
Negative,I COULDN'T EVEN EDGE TO THIS,0
Negative,"this game will make u wanna kill urself, if u wanna live dont play",0
Negative,"More annoying than fun IMO. If I could atleast respawn outside the bosses I would not have to do the same 1 minute run 100 times over. Thats not challenging, only waste of my time.",0
Negative,erm. nobody told me this game was going to be hard,0
Negative,it's mid. Only 3 Bosses were actually enjoyable. edit after i tried another playthroughoverglorified bs,0
Negative,"Compared solely to FROMSOFT's other titles I've played (Elden Ring, Demon Souls & Bloodborne) Dark Souls 3 is the bottom of the barrel.This was my first Dark Souls game and aside from the few cool bosses the overall experience was quite monotonous.",0
Negative,this is not fun,0
Negative,"Unfortunately, the controls were designed by the antichrist. Roll and run are the same button, so your rolls are always delayed until you let go of the button (pretty big deal when some attacks are not telegraphed at all). Kicking and jump attacking require awful key combinations with insanely strict timings and ridiculous limitations like not letting you kick if you turn your camera slightly. Dual-wielding your left-hand weapon requires a long press, which makes it unresponsive if you try to use it in combat. All your spells and your tools, including your heal, have to be accessed through a horrible carousel system that has you desperately mashing down to try to find your estus before you die. And of course, you cannot change ANY of this, even if you play with a keyboard.Also, online is dead.",0
Negative,Game has been offline for a while now. Bandai Namco dropped the ball since the release of DS1 remastered.,0

Negative,I spent 14 fucking hours in a loading screen,0
Negative,"Thanks for showing us that we don't actually own the games we paid full price for, and with a snap of their fingers, the devs can shut down the servers, stripping the game of half of its value. You can't even play with hamachi, because they purposefully disabled the use of multiplayer items when servers are down. So yeah, not buying Elden Ring, nor any other titles from this company, they clearly don't give a damn. And don't get me started on what they did with the first dark souls.",0

Negative,"After the desastrous performance of DS Remastered, I thought I'll try DS III because I've heard it performs better than DS:R and it's on sale at the moment.The game doesn't even start. It boots up into a black screen and shows up as ""not responding"" in task manager. I don't want to waste my time with such bullshit. Refunded.",0
Negative,Great game with really interesting fantasy lore and atmosphere. Difficult gameplay that rewards people who don't give up.However the mmultiplayer functions of all the Dark Souls games do not work. They took down all of the servers due to an exploit and said that they are not going to open them back up. Selling this game at full price is deceitful and criminal; especially when they advertise the multiplayer aspects of Dark Souls.,0
Negative,The game is grate but the main hate i feel for this game is the pvp its on e of the worse lag i have ever seen on this game and i pray the sun that Elden Ring gets treated better with no poor connection between players.Like i said the game it self is wonderful the reason i would not recommend is the bad connection between players.,0
Negative,I'm sure this is an excellent game for some people and I really wanted to like it. But I've tried twice for 90 minutes to not get killed over and over and over and over and over again by Gundyr. It's just not fun and just not for me.,0
Negative,"Third entry in the series and the netcode still sucks, and two of the covenants rely on multiplayer to rank up and get items for the achievements.People complain a lot about DS2 but at least you can buy the missing spells at drangleic castle on NG2+ instead of grinding a lot or getting angry on multiplayer. Some cool ideas from DS2 were also ignored because why not.Just play the first dark souls instead",0
Negative,"i used to be able to play it, now for the past 2 weeks no matter what i did it doesnt even launch, i press play and nothing happens, not even the application loads, i reinstalled it 3 times, i even moved to to my ssd, i undated my c++, updated my graphics, turned off my DNS Software but to no avail, im very disappointed, i wanted to play this game since it Halloween just passed + i saw a streamer play it and reminded me that i never completed, i would have given it a yes, but due to the factor that the game doesnt even load im going to have to give a no",0
Negative,"Not yet. Maybe If I can not suck so much at it. I feel like the game is just trolling me for not being good, which might be deserved, but I can't recommend a game I can't enjoy.I will keep trying it and hopefully one day I can break through the barrier.",0

Negative,"baddest part of soulsso many rolls, poor magic mechanics, fast bosses, stages, toxic pvp, weapon artsthe only part where I don't care about server shutdowns and game deathunfair pvp(red players can heal with estus)",0
Negative,"I know that I am going to get a lot of angry comments for this but I am not going to pretend that everything is fine. The game overall is a good game and fun to play; however, there are a lot of frustrations and problems with this game that keeps me from recommending it to annoy unless you love the series greatly.Firstly, I don't mind when game developers reuse a game engine that they used for another game and sometimes you can barely tell at all unless it is explicitly revealed to you. In this case, I really don't like how lazy it feels. It feels like a heavily modified Bloodborne game done by professional developers. The sound design of ""footsteps"" (which I find for some weird reason to be extremely annoying sometimes when there is total silence as it sounds like I am wearing some very unconventional footwear when I am in metal armor head to toe), which is just the same one used in Bloodborne. The framerate of this game is very taxing on my computer for seemingly no reason when I can run other games that are much more graphically and memory demanding than this game just fine at higher settings. The voice sound muffled on speakers requiring me to have to use headphones in order to hear what is being said. I know that subtitles are an option but I don't like looking at subtitles to understand what someone is saying. Some enemies feel very cheap and unsatisfying to fight and are usually the ones that don't only appear once when slayed. Human A.I. ""player"" enemies do not feel fun to fight against. Whenever I get invaded, unlike the other games, instead of mentally thinking ""Oh! Another!"", my mind thinks ""NO! NOT NOW!"" or ""NO! GO AWAY!"".Another thing that becomes an issue because Dark Souls III is literately just a modified Bloodborne game is that Armor feels somewhat pointless. You cannot upgrade it like the past two games. Using armors for different stats gives you a ""slightly"" better defense against things. Lastly, the armor provides a percent reduction in damage, not a flat defensive value. Why? Because that's because how it worked in Bloodborne.I do really like this game; however, I cannot safely recommend this game to a friend. In addition, I don't know what happened between Dark Souls II and Dark Souls III; however, if another player has poor internet connection or is lagging badly it is glaringly noticeable as they will teleport or hits will not land because, as far the game is concerned, the other player is no longer there.I love this game.but I don't see why I should recommend it for someone else to experience the same learning curve as me.",0
Negative,"basically unplayable garbage. i wanted to do a luck build with hollowing but apparently killing anri before yuria appears fs up that questline. also the dark sword on darkwraiths is just their skin texture stretched over the sword, from soft can also bite me for charging 80 bucks for a 5 year old game that is so easy to min max in a goat could do it.",0
Negative,This game is a great game played it on console but This game came out in 2016 and it doesnt have support from fromsoft the community boards posts are complaints that online is flooded with hackers and for me the game doesnt even launch and i cant find official help about issues like this. They have done nothing to combat the hackers or fix performance of the game.,0
Negative,didn't like it,0
Negative,"if u love life, dont play this game",0
Negative,"it`s just Dark Souls I but way worsemost bosses where super easy, for some you didnt even need to be skilled bcs there was a built in mechanic to kill them so all the grind wasnt worth at that point.there are spots to farm endless souls very fast and many crazy weapons which i believe are op for pvp but i could never try out pvp cause online service didnt work while i played trough the whole game.wtfi played ultra great weapons and was never possible to add poison, holy, fire or any other buff/enchantment to any of the strength weapons i found, so all the material grind for nothingi couldnt weare any clothes bcs of the new skilling system so i had to use smaller weapons. so i could atleast wear something instead of looking at this bone bum.i couldnt wear the set i wanted nor wield the weapons i wanted nor using the shield i wanted nor using the spells i wanted. maybe i should have grinded to lvl 300 ?( I was lvl 120)even doe my weapon had S scaling in Strength i would only make +29 dmg by adding 15 levels to strength. how? that by knowing each level costs ++90.000 souls .killed every boss after few tries. except the nameless king who took me 16 tries after i gave up bcs i had to switch weapon or skills to beat him. all in all game looks nice and makes fun to progress. but for me it wasnt worth its time.yet another try( bcs online works now), i played as Knight with armor and shield and a sword, came to finish easy and fast at lvl 104 (farmed about 5 level so i could use a good armor) didnt make any fun except the overall progression and ""char build up"". PvP was bad one side allways OP, I was fighting some not good players, and sometimes crazy nerds with one-trick pony builds. but hte worst of them all are the bad connection ones, where you hit them 6 times, while they are in range, they get no hits, then out of nowhere(while you didnt even attack or hold the shield) they do a parry move and kill you. very frustrating. Also there where people pvping early game with crazy damage and lategame weapons, i dont understand how this is balanced. PvP for me, big downer. Time waisted again.",0

Negative,Bsically dark souls 1 and 2,0
Negative,They will perma ban you if you use a switch pro controller.,0
Negative,I am not sure how safe it is to give your players stockholm syndrome. I don't think I need to list all the ways this game isn't player friendly. The poor UI is just to make up for slow moving bosses shortcomings. Everything is very intense when you're scrolling through your item wheel. The enemies will sometimes damage each other and sometimes not. This game could be fixed if you could climb things and had a better UI,0
Negative,It's really good,0

Negative,"If you care about online play, do NOT get this game. You can and WILL get banned through no fault of your own. I just received a ban because of invalid items on my account that I never picked up. They were 'injected' by an invading player. Does Bandai protect players from that? No, they just ban the victim. Don't give this company your money.",0
Negative,"DS1 but worse. Enemies don't have unique movement patterns, or attacks. It typically just feels like 90% of the enemies at least in the early game, just flail toward you and it turns into dodge roll central. Some bosses fall flat as well. That tree boss was kind of Blood Bournie. Now that I think about it, it feels like most of the game is trying to be Bloodborne when both games operate in completely different ways. There are literal rehash places from DS1. I'd rather play DS 2",0
Negative,"I like the game and the play style, it's just as difficult as the memes say it is. However, although this game is infuriating through the difficulty, it has a shitty downside. At any point in time, a hacker could join your world and ruin the online experience for you. Just picking up a modified item could render your online days over, and it would take at LEAST a month for you to even have a CHANCE to play online again.",0
Negative,"Will this enemy hit your shield once and then be staggerd or will he hit multiple times? Nobody knows.

Negative,Way too hard. This is not the game for me. I would totally return this or gift it to someone else if I could.,0
Negative,"This is by far the worst one in the entire series. It's whole lore thing about time repeating is just a cheap easy way to ret-con certain lore aspects from other games. ( Nashandra's picture in irithyll, smough, orenstein) The game has always had major balancing issues and the anti cheat system is awful. Poise has nevver worked in this one unless you used perseverance but that also forces you to either use a certain weapon or waste a weapon slot on ceastus. Don't even get me started on how easy it is to smurf and min max in this one. The weapon scaling system makes it even easier and that is a major problem. You can be a newbie with a un upgraded weapon and get blasted by a dude with a dark hand. Certain weapons (i.e. Ultrra paired greatswords) were completely broken and were never really fixed. Not to mention it's community is some of the worst people, They don't know PvP manners such as not drinking estus during a 1v1, bowing or gesturing before fights, not knowing how fight clubs work, running into 1v1's and ruining it by helping a person get killed. By far this game is the worst in the series. If you still buy this game at full price then you have a serious mental disorder.",0
Negative,"If you want to have fun, avoid this game",0
Negative,what the fuck,0
Negative,"The weakest entry in the series. It's still a very good game, but it just cant live up to DS1 in any way, and it has very limited viable build options compared to the very different DS2. Play it if you have played the first two but else dont bother.",0
Negative,"This game is what happens when a studio relies on artists and advertisers - you wind up with a wonderful art piece that barely functions as a video game.The engine doesn't perform collision detection properly:- Hitboxes rarely line up with meshes. Nothing seems to ""connect""; sliding against invisible edges is common.- Enemy attacks teleport into your hitbox if the engine feels the enemy should land the hit.- Inconsistent movement. Edge yourself off a ledge to demo. You'll fall on a different pixel every time.- Animation interpolation is virtually non-existent. This makes enemies twitchy and unreadable.- Poor optimization/LOD logic causes hitching on non-SSDs. I have 32GB of RAM, why is this game ever looking at my hard drive during a fight, at all?- Camera takes control away from the user. For example, running forces the camera to follow your forward view. As well, there is no way to put the camera into ""noclip"" mode.- Invulnerability during animations on specific frames is rampant. This is a technical limitations of the 90's born out of a lack of motion capture and generalist programmers. Could they have paid for one less armor piece, and spent some money on development?As far as the game itself goes, it was designed with the express intention of angering players by ganking them with gimmicks and jank. The only two ""challenges"" you will experience is not having foreknowledge of enemy attacks, and struggling to make your character do what you want it to do while it's colliding against invisible hitboxes.This is a Bethesda product with a different set of neuroses; manipulative marketing; and a very strange fan base comprised of ostriches who like to shame others whilst their head's in the sand.Don't buy :).",0

Negative,"PC controls are clunky. Enemies can be in melee range and your character will still flail wildly doing no damage because he's attacking 20 degrees away unless you lock on, but once you lock on to an enemy all movement (and the camera) circles around them, which makes retreating to sip flasks clunky unless you unlock again. The combat is fast-paced and unforgiving enough without having to fight the camera movement and controls too.Also, all the instructions in the tutorial show moves using x-box controls, which makes them meaningless to a PC player. There are actually a lot of combat moves to figure out, you can't just spam attacks. Figuring out everything by experimentation was not pleasant.If you've never played a souls game before. buyer beware.",0
Negative,This is a terrible port. I can't recommend buying it on Steam at all. Play it on a console if you really want to play it. Even before you get to the actual gameplay the character creation screen is buggy and the character preview repeatedly freezes requiring you to restart the game. If the developers cared at all about this port they would have fixed it by now. The game is also effectively unplayable with keyboard and mouse. They didn't even try to remap any prompts with the keybindings. The camera controls with keyboard and mouse are buggy. I've had the camera get stuck in terrain. There is an auto-target but it doesn't reliably trigger because you either need to be very close to the enemy and it can be thrown off by elevation changes.,0
Negative,"The game in general is fun and challenging. However i bought the game wanting to play co-op with a friend; and we just cant get over how stupid of a design decision it was to make invasions obligatory; at least give me the option of turning them off. I don't care for the invasion side of the game, i don't want to invade, i don't want to be invaded. I don't find it a fun nor engaging part of the game, so just let me opt-out. I want to like the game, i really do, but with invasions being obligatory. no, i just hate it. Why are they (the developers) actively discouraging players from enjoying the game? Some people seem to think its due to ""creative vision"", to that i say ""I don't give two shits about their creative vision. Giving me the option to play the game the way I like to play it doesn't hurt the 'creative vision' one bit."". And to those saying ""just get good"", don't bother.",0

It is a VERY poor port of the console version; they do not even bother to show you the equivalent keyboard and mouse commands during the tutorial - you're told to hit the ""left button"" to guard? Oh, I see, you mean the *right button*. And the other commands are even more frustrating: you seriously have to do sleuthing to figure them out. one of the top Googles for this is ""what are the keyboard and mouse commands?""I cannot use game controllers for long; they kill my carpal tunnel syndrome. But hey, the reviews were great so I caved in and bought a USB game controller. Okay, at least the buttons make sense now, but not everything works. ""right plus B equals dash?"" Um no, it seems to equal ""roll.""Next up, and more importantly: the game is *boring* - I'm not drawn into the story at all; there doesn't seem to be any engaging character or hero. Nothing for me to *care* about. Just a generic arcade game in a fantasy scenario.Finally, the game is *ugly*. Even after turning my resolution to max and every setting to ultra, the game looks seriously blocky and ugly, even by 2016 standards. I've played a number of games from ""back in the day"" that were, and still are, seriously beautiful, for the most part. Let's say. the Witcher 3, anyone?So, confusing, frustrating, boring, and ugly. HOW is this a top-selling game, again?",0
Negative,"went trough most of the game whitout any issiues. but toward the last streatch for the prince boss, the game starts o zeases, hangs, and crashes so ****** frecuently, its neer impossible to play. had to re do the grand archive 6 times due to crashes.",0
Negative,"I get invaders down to 10% health, they roll heal before my blade is even swinging, we do this dance again and again and again then they have me down now and so i heal finally oh boy only 2 drinks left better beat him now, well have they drink 10 more times i need to drink again, surely they're almost out of estus, nope and now im out and they're still drinking! ya this isn't dark souls, I'm not bad at the game I'm being punished for not having all the estus yet.TL:DR You get punished for not having all the estus yet, get gud does not apply here.Let me also add, I enjoy the game itself, just not the broken pvp. Enjoyed the pvp in ds2 and ds ptd",0
Negative,"It's a really bad port. I have a decent gaming rig that handles every other game in my list perfectly (like DOOM everything on ultra 300+ fps, etc.) unless it's also just a crappy port or poorly optimized like 7 days to die, but Dark souls 3 takes the cake.It stutters every now and then and after a recent update it even started to freeze. In some areas it freezes for a few seconds but if you revisit the area it is suddenly fine. At first I thought it was the Xbone Controller, but nope even without any usb peripherals it does the same thing. Tried all the various fixes on the internet, even put it on my SSD. It's still just a bad port.In some areas you're taken back to the glory days of games like Morrowind where the game froze to load the new areas on the map. That's how it feels. No smooth transition just choppy and laggy situations or even complete freezes. And it didn't do that when I first played it, at least not to this extent. It must've become like this after some of the updates. It's just not fun to play a game that requires fast reactions and quick responses when it lags and freezes. Scholar of the first sin runs without any issues at all. They somehow must've made the engine of DS3 worse than it already was, I have no other explanation.",0
Negative,"This game stinks of mediocrity.Very bland and repetitive game play.Story. What story ?Is it hard ? Kinda i guess but as long as you roll on the floor like a prick you're fine.This game leveling is rat piss annoying, and becomes a grind fest very quickly.No PC controls. Last time i checked computers come with keyboard and a mouse not a game controller.If you never played a souls games don't bother, this isn't your typical fantasy game, you don't get a sense of progression you just move from an area to another with bosses in between, even the regular trash mobs are deadly and fighting more than one enemy at a time is a big no no.Doom 2016 on ultra nightmare (permanent death) was more manageable and fun and that was way harder because you were 2 hits away from death, more mobility meant many ways to deal with things. I know the games in question are different but the point i try to make is even when i died in Doom i had a motivation to start over because i got killed by my fault but Dark Souls 3 when you die it feels like the game screwed you over, the difficulty is bottom of the barrel hard.This is the most unforgiving the most insufferable and hard game ever but for all the wrong reasons. Dark Souls 3 is very restrictive, stiff, and grind a lot for souls to level.It's a shame because it could be a good game, but the game can't be bothered to explain how certain game mechanics work, example is (parry and kick, rolling and many many more) i have a feeling these developers are very lazy you can tell by the crap port they slapped Xbox button prompts on PC and the game ""tutorial"" if you can call it that. it's just explaining very basic stuff like camera movement or blocking, yeah thanks that helps a lot. How about telling me how the I-frame works when rolling, that would be a far more helpful information to tell me than push a stick to move the camera.This very reason is the cause of 90% of new players giving up on the game, my guess is they made the game too hard and it was too late to re-balance the game or adjust the difficulty and they slapped this immune when rolling thing at the last second.It's the only explanation i can think of why every bog standard trash mob in this game can kill you so easily.",0

Negative,"Pros:Game is hard.Single player is fine and you can choose to NOT take part in PvP.Graphics. eh who cares. It's fine, maybe even good looking.Storyline and lore. I don't really care about the lore here but it's not annoying BS. Fits the game. Con:Co-op is a lot of the time NOT FUN, especially in the early game as you can't turn off the PvP element while you are still wielding a club and sporting no items worthy of mention and when you constantly get invaded by people that have spent 1000 hours making a low level ""twink"" by passing on NG+ items from their other characters, reinforcing their weapons and min-maxing their builds for newbie crushing purposes.You CAN kill them. It just takes a million years because they have a ton of HP, they hit like a train and keep healing up with estus even though you have used one of those undead charm things THAT'S SUPPOSED TO NOT ALLOW ESTUS HEALING. (I suppose those would be cheaters, but hey, add that to the list and make it plural.)It's a major pain in the ass when you can't progress in the game because of constant invasions by these no-life people, so it ruins the Co-op experience.Inb4 Notes:There's supposedly a mechanic where characters with improved weapons can't attack characters with majorly less improved weapons. Well it doesn't work because the balance is still broken. At low levels a gap of +2 is enough to mean the other one kills you in 4-5 hits while you might need 10-30 depending on the invader's hp etc.Of course I have to mention there are items to make mobs attack the invaders etc. But, they are not available from the start and also a few mobs are not going to stop these mommys little supermen.And of course it doesn't help that there is bound to be a skill difference between someone who has played thousands of hours of DS games and some ""newbie"" who has played a max of below a 4-digit number of hours total between all DS gamesI suppose this problem will be less pronounced when a new DS game comes out and the cellar dwellers move on to start making their twinks there.If.A. there was an option to turn off PvP from the menu.(maybe you could have it limited so you can have it off until lvl X or something?)B. there was a minimum level X for getting invaded.C. there was some cheap newbie item like the undead charm thing that would be more penalizing for the invader AND ACTUALLY WORKED (assuming it wasn't a cheater), with perhaps a level cap to when it can be used.D. there was a mechanic that if you have NG+ items or have a certain amount of playtime on a character, you couldn't invade people with practically no time or items on their character.then the co-op experience would probably be a lot better without ruining other game elements.",0

Negative,"Suprisingly, I couldn't get into this game.I enjoyed it for awhile, but I find myself going back to I and II.Maybe I'll try it again some day, but it just didn't hold my interest.",0
Negative,"Gameplay: A hardcore RPG with great combat mechanics for its type of game. It offers very little forgiveness and the possibillity to do anything you want with your character. You're put into the game with only knowlege of the very basic controls. There is zero hand holding. The game has some weird minor glitches from time to time, but rarely anything major (In my 400ish hours of playing the game I've had 1 major glitch where my computer crashed in the middle of playing the game, and when I rebooted and relogged into the game all my saves had been deleted, but there is a very slim chance of this happening).Graphics: A beautiful and horrible world, filled with beautiful and horrible art to match it. Each weapon in the game has a grand attention to detail, the armors are beautiful.your character.well thats up to you , but the overal apearance of the game is great.Multiplayer upon release: An amazing co op experiance with tons of people looking to do anything anywhere. This includes other players trying to invade and kill you for your ""ember"" (the spark that allows you to connect to other worlds and gives you an health bonus).Current multiplayer: Constant hackers, I've recorded about 2 hours of in game footage of hackers running amuck ruining any form of PvP or PvE (with freinds). These hacks include people instantly killing you in the PvP duel arena, people flying in the air and shooting a spell that travels much faster than it should and instantly kills you.the list goes on and on, about 1/6 people I invade/get invaded by, end up exploiting or using some form of hacks. The reason for this is because player items/status can be edited with a downloadable online editor. This editor has been around for awhile, but in the past 2 weeks it seems like the majority of people who are using it are no longer getting banned.This sole reason is why I cannont reccomend this game. I look to Dark Souls as a online focused game, but it has now started to slip into a downward state because of the game exploits/hacks that are ongoing. (such as enemies invading in boss rooms, being instantly cursed by a giant storm a player summons, invisible spears killing you, the list goes on and on).On any other account I would have to reccoemnd this game, but if you want to seek to have any online play at all, I would steer clear of it now. If you want it for only singleplayer, then feel free to get it.",0
Negative,"This game is 10/10 if you want to Co-op with friends. It's 7/10 if you want to PVE solo one playthrough. It's 5/10 if you want to solo and PvP. Why? Because invasions are broken. There's no longer enough people that play for you to be matched with people in your immediate level range. Invading another person's game works like this, you can invade people 5-10 levels lower than you but you'll also be able to invade people 20-30 levels higher than you. With a low population this means most of your invasions are going to be against guys that take way less damage than you and deal way more. 120 used to be where everybody stopped, but now at 120 most of your invasions are going to be agaist 3 level 135+ players. If you're a god I guess this doesn't matter, but if you're looking for fun you're not going to find it after your first playthrough of the game. They're going to be using the heaviest armor in the game, a meta weapon, and buff that thing to 700+ damage easy. For example, if you play a 120 strength build (gigantic clunky sword) you will be out damaged by somebody with a straight sword who is 130+. Now imagine invading 150's all night. No this isn't recommended.",0

Negative,"Tl;dr DS is mostly hard because of the terrible controls. If you were actually in control of your character the game would be way easier and fun.First tried to play with mouse + keyboard but the tutorial of the game only shows the controller symbols. After trying to figure it out for a while I gave up and switched to my old Xbox 360 controller. Controls are still terrible with that tho. For example you have to hold left stick + B and then press the left stick in to jump. Another example would be parry being on LT which only registers after you pushed it in 0,5 cm which obisously is terrible for things that need timing.Due to the controller you also can't strafe which might really fuck with your movement if you aren't used to not strafing.Also it feels like all my character input is delayed. If I press B to dodge my character does nothing for half a second, then gets hit and then after that does the roll when I no longer need it and wastes stamina by doing so. No action feels responsive in this game, like there was a built in delay for everything. The world and artstyle is really nice so if you feel like getting used to delayed character controls you will have a great world to explore.EDIT: After another 13 hours I switched back to mouse and keyboard which made the game a lot easier for me after figuring out the buttons. Most of my complaints still apply tho. Because sprint and dodge are on the same button (you can't bind them to different keys) theres always a delay because the game need to figure out if you are holding the button to start sprinting or if you are releasing it to roll. Also you can't rebind kick and I still have no idea what combination of buttons makes me kick since the tutorial was only for controller and I can't look it up in the controls (since you can't rembind it it isn't even listed). So now I just sometimes kick randomly and I don't know why.The input queue is really REALLY annoying too. If you press the attack button before your attack finishes it will automatically queue another attack even if you didnt press again when the animation of the first attack finished. So you end up rolling / attacking when you don't want it sometimes.That makes the whole experience needlessly clunky.",0

Negative,Control scheme doesn't carry over to PC very well.,0
Negative,"This game is GREAT FOR MASOCHISTS.(Reason for label Negative is on the bottom)Here are my complaints and other. things: The game is hard, indeed. The shields are pretty much uselless shit but you need it to fight groups of enemies with higher AS. Rolls are terrible technique. You can roll in full armor all the fucking time even with practically no stamina and guess what? It's the only thing that works. Everything MISLEADS you and only a little is explained. Items could have better descriptions (and I don't mean damned stats, you can shove them up your ass). I accidentally killed an important guy because he talked shit about how he wants death. Then I found out the guy can be useful but there is no way to bring him back so I had to play it again. Things in the game looks like their only purpose is to fuck up with you, like it wouldn't be enough that there are hidden powerful enemies, mimics and other stuff all around. So far, where I said to myself ""fuck it"", there is pretty much no story. Along with endless rolling, runing here and there like retard after dying, analyzing movements of your enemies over and over, and dealing with the same shit without a change the game gets boring, especially when a great frozen fuck gets you because you have no way to block a shit n you dont roll fast enough. Again, the REPETETIVE goddamn running here and there because you die or have to buy something or maybe go to another place without fighting annoying enemies is just awful. FIGHTING is weird, along with earlier mentioned rolling like a damn armadillo and shields with use of trash can lid, even the ""weak"" enemies can deal you great amount of damage and after that you have to spend your sacred estus so you can survive another fight if you god forbid it get a random stun lock (if you aren't killed instantly lol). And ranged aiming seems weird to me but you may be fine with it, idk. AMBIENCE is great but gets boring when you are stuck in one location. DESIGN is not bad at all, some are weird but some are really great and realistic. MUSIC is cool but I really hate how it gets really deep, fast and on 300% volume in moment you enter bossfight (for me it gets annoying after moment, makes your focus worse and I have to decrease the volume right away - subjective!). I usually do but at this game, don't even remember how did I get it. Generally tho, for 60 it seems like a damn sick gamble between greatest game you have ever played and absolutely terrible piece of garbage.I know there are people who love this game, good for you. This Review is marked as Negative because there is nothing in between and I recommend you to purchase this game only if you are sure you will like it, and if you still don't know, to be sure you stay in the extent where you can ask for refund.Good luck and hope you will enjoy it, praise the sun.",0

Negative,Kb/M support non-existent.

Negative,"My first playthrough of Dark Souls 3 was very enjoyable and let me put it straight its a good game all by itself . But its not even close to the quality of Dark Souls 1 . I have no itentions to bash this game but everything about Dark Souls 3 feels flat or functional . Even Bloodborne's engine fails to recapture the atmosphere of Lordran . The levels just feel varied enough to push through the game but not even a single location is noteworthy or memorable , most of the areas are castles and dungeons and swamps and forests , not that they are badly designed but they don't really overwhelm the imagination and leave you in awe like like Ash Lake , Painted Worlds , Lost Izalith and so many others from Dark Souls 1 .And the enemies are a mixed bunch, many feel like they don't even belong in the world of Dark Souls . For Example : Giant Crabs ! I expected more from FROM SOFTWARE . Where is the magic gone ? Ultimately Dark Souls 3 feels like a Dark Souls game lacking the mood and the atmosphere of what made Dark Souls a unique gem and does nothing to add to the original's legacy .",0

Negative,"I really dislike the dark souls games and i've been trying to figure out why for some time, for a while i bought into the idea that i just wasn't smart enough or skilled enough to play them but now i think i've figured out what my issue is with them.What it comes down to is how you learn a games mechanics, in most games you are given a choice of difficulty so you can start of at a lower one so you can both learn the games mechanics and stll enjoy it;s story and progression this is generally what keeps me invested in a game and keeps me playing.But in Souls like games this approach does not work and i dont think is intended, so for an example lets take a boss, what i like to do is take my time and learn what works and doesn't work against them and in most cases health is sufficient to take some hits and practice fighting the boss, but in souls likes it doesn't allow this kind of learning you are expected to either get it right or die and they expect you to learn from this and try again, this goes back to how older generation games tended to work where you would repeat the section over and over until you figure it out, but growing up with those games i generally came to dislike this approach, and then i played doom with its difficulty options this for me was perfect as it gave me a bit of space to figure things out while still enjoying the game, this is what from software is missing and i hope that in the future they will understand that not everyone learns the same way, so until difficulty levels are implemented in there games i cannot support them which is sad to me because i love the art and the lore in these games but the way they work is just not suitable for me and others who learn like me, i dont think that these games are difficult they just dont allow a gentle progression which is what i would love to see in the future.",0
Negative,"Dark Souls 3 has a very old fashioned static maze like game design. What this means is there's really no way for you to know anything about the game except via trial and error or you look it up via a 3rd party like Youtube. Luckily it's a very popular game so there is hours upon hours of guides. Whether that be the story line / lore of the game / explanations of what stats do / hard and soft cap (break points) for stats / or ways to cheese bosses during fights.The dev team did a good job in recapturing old game design like Super Mario Bros. You gotta get to the boss as healthy as you can be and you better know what the boss is going to do! When you die go back and do it again getting a little better at the maze each time until you beat it. They also have several easter egg type mechanics that can make certain fights much easier if you're observant (or if you look them up in guides).The controls are very unresponsive and clunky. There's no way to switch the default keybinds from console keybinds to PC keybinds. So you'll have to memorize the conversions of Console to PC commands and most likely have to make new binds. I think if you're looking to buy Dark Souls 3 I would go out and find a USB controller to play with. In MMORPGs and RPGs I generally always play casters and I found the magic in DS3 to be very lack luster I'm use to playing casters with upwards of 30+ abilities keybound. This is the main reason I chose to not recommend this game. However, I would recommend this game more for people interested in hack and slash style game play rather than magic. I think if you like God of War / Darksiders type game play you'll enjoy DS3. It's a throwback game design that was and is extremely enjoyable to a lot of people. Personally I prefer magic focused RPGs and the magic/caster elements of this game don't have enough depth to really keep my attention.TLDR: Buy a controller for this game : At the very least look up what each stat does and its hard and soft caps",0

Negative,"Great game , love the difficulty and mechanics.Only 1 giant problem.Character save files are kept on your hard disk. Meaning if you by any chance get fucked by ""soft that is also so micro"" or anything else really and need to reinstall your OS or anything in similar manner youre fucked.And i found it the hard way.I own deluxe edition which is fuckin 85euro, yet doesnt have simple thing as cloud saves. Thanks MiyazakiI still highly recommend to buy the game, hell even older titles in series (fuck the DS2 sotfs doe, get ""vanilla""one instead)",0
Negative,"Originally bought this on the PS4 at launch and played for maybe 20 hours before losing interest, and recently came back to see if my opinion had changed. Sadly, I have definitely soured since then, and I can say that I don't like it all that much. Dark Souls III is the worst Souls-style game From Software has made, by a country mile. And that includes Demon's Souls' original version, Bloodborne, Sekiro, Demon's Souls Remake, and Elden Ring.It's not a terrible game, per se, and some fun can be scraped up by the devoted, but I certainly have no affection for it. More often than not it's just annoying and sloggy, and feels like a much worse version of Demon's Souls with more than a slight nod to Bloodborne's twisted, Halloween version of medieval fantasy.Bonfire distance seems random. They are often too close together when engaging in general traversal, but are too far from actual boss fights. It gives the feeling of being coddled during normal play, but feels almost abusive when confronting a challenging boss. It feels untested and rushed. Speaking of bosses.Bosses are bullshit. My biggest issue with the Souls games usually comes down to poor camera control and stability. A lot of Dark Souls 3's early bosses are focused on tells that happen off screen if you are locked on, because they are too high in the air or the boss is simply too big. It leaves you to rely on sound cues, which ""could"" be good game design, but it feels cheap here. I had to rely on this tactic for the witch boss in the woods, and what I ended up doing was just spamming the dodge button when I heard the airborne attack bursting above me, and then I just mashed it in between attacks when up against the boss and she died easily. The victory felt so cheap because the more I tried and paid attention, the more I died. so I just yeeted in there and yolo'd my inputs and the boss crumbled. Terrible. But that's not even counting the glitches and general jank. Your weapon will bounce like a ricocheting bullet off of any surface that isn't a destructible object, but frequently, large enemy weapons like polearms will have no collision detection with the environment whatsoever, which gives the impression that you are playing by a completely different set of rules than the enemy. Want to try to bottleneck an enemy through a doorway? Lol, idiot, they can just cut through the wall and take half of your healthbar. This applies to the Deacons of the Deep bossfight, where I was doing fine, had the boss comfortably down to the second phase, then I made a bad move and got struck by an enemy (my fault, that's fine), which was follwed up by a gigantic enemy magic attack that soared right through a 30 foot wide object in the middle of the room. No collision detection. No warning. Nothing.I think my biggest issue, though, is how terrible the lock on system is. It's ps1 levels of garbage. It frequently breaks for no discernible reason whatsoever, and quite often cannot find someone I am 10 feet away from, have the camera pointed at, and have my character facing. It's absolutely maddening.I also had a few enemies clip directly into the environment or get stuck in the air during fights. All of this gives the game an unpolished, unfinished feeling that I can't shake.Ultimately, that's where I tapped out on my return to this. fiasco. Dark Souls 3 is even worse than the frequently cheap, annoying, tedious game I remembered. This series is near and dear to me, but Dark Souls 3 foists upon you a depressingly unfun experience that leans into all the worst aspects of the series. For every moment of fun I found myself having, I had at least one or two moments where I was simply exhausted trying to look past all of the problems rubbing themselves in my face. Irritating status debuffs, tanky enemies, horrendous camera, janky lock on, poor collision detection, and a small, sometimes bland world all conspire to leave you with something that feels less like an engrossing adventure than a game of inches.",0
Negative,"I don't like the changes in ds3. it's more like bloodborne than dark souls. PvP is based around meta weapons. it's hard to defeat opponent with meta weapon. healing for invader is a bit too much, it makes most invasions too long (ds2 solved it in a better way. invaders can't heal but phantoms too). about the pve the bosses are fine, but locations become boring fast,especially that progress is much more linear than ds1 or even ds2. (after dlcs it's a bit better). the plot actually is not that engaging comparing to other games. there're some interesting quests and lore but most of it is just ds1 fanservice put everywhere.",0
Negative,"After putting considerable hours into this game i'm already done with it.The main story is riddled with highly missable things that are borderline integral to making an otherwise bland boss-run of a solo game actually enjoyable. And regardless of which, it becomes painfully hard to play after the third playthrough. Add that to the fact that many enemies become overpowered due to the lack of poise and it becomes pretty unenjoyable fairly quickly, considering the game is only a few months old.Now for the multiplayer.Wholely unenjoyable, but thats down to the community really. I loved Dark Souls. But this one is just one big snoozefest. The NG+ game is too easy, the covenants didn't work until only very recently and more often than not if I am autosummoned to a world i'm sent right back due to the fight taking shorter than the summoning time!",0
Negative,"Dear developers, your game looks and feels amazing, I would recommend it to everyone, because of the challanges the game gives you.But this is a angry review.Reasons:Network glitches: Getting help or summoning others is impossible unless you use a Ember. Allso most of the time when me and my friends try to get help or want to help then the servers use to much time to send us help or send us to the person that needs help. Allso, that anyone can at any time just invade your game when you only want to run around and experiance the game with some help and have some fun.Mob/NPC glitches: I've come across, normal mobs, bigger mobs, small bosses and big bosses that respawns instantly as soon as you kill them. There is a bug in the programming that is so bad that I want my cash back for this game.Buttons: Locking people is very hard, unless your character actually is turned the correct way and is looking at them you cannot lock them, but the npcs for example can shoot you with spells and arrows fromt he other side of the damn map, while yourself has to move within 3 meters of them to be able to target them.And the jumping? Which idiot remapped the keys in such a horrible way that people who actually could do DS2 without leveling cant even get a single item because they have to use forever to find out how to jump in a game.",0

I am honestly very dissapointed with From Software, because I have read that many other people have had issues with this PC port.",0
Negative,"I mean it's a Dark Souls game, the game is not meant to be easy. The game is fun and challenging at times, and grinding makes this game a breeze. The only reason I won't recommend this game period, is Invading.Invading is such a toxic thing that really ruins this game. It always happens before a boss and someone invades, kills me and I have to fight to get back to where I was. I wish I didn't have to unplug my ethernet cable everytime, someone either invades or forces me to invade. Like do these people just have that terrible of a life that they have to share there misery with me. No thank you. TBH people who do this, deserve a death worse than any in this game, and so do the devs who thought this idea was good.Outside of my saltyness on that subject, the game is fine.

Negative,"This is from the perspective of someone who has never played a Dark Souls game before. Only 110 minutes played so I could return this.Pros:-First and foremost, the difficulty. is amazing! It really follows the whole ""hardest game"" thing and I love it. That is a big bonus for this game.-Beautiful sceneryCons:-The pros are unfortunately completely overshadowed by the fact that this game has the most clunky half a**ed and terrible porting of any game I have ever played. -Keyboard and mouse controls are terrible and clunky. You cannot accurately move in the direction you want to and feels like a pokemon game.-All and I mean ALL in game tips and keybinds show xbox buttons. This means it says ""press A to continue"" or ""press B to go back"" for example. Meanwhile you are left to your own devices to figure out what keyboard button does what within in game menus.-The complexity of the controls on keyboard make the console versions look like a cake walk. Want to move in dodge and swipe from the side? Better hope you are perfectly lined up enough for your 90 degree directional facing to put you in the right spot while you utilize a mix of keys between holding shift, pressing space bar and clicking X mouse button to perform simple attacks, while consoles press left bumper. ==Note, you get the hang of it eventually, but the keyboard is so far behind controllers you are literally handicapped and unable to perform the variety of tactics possible unless you purchase a controller to play with due to the precision of the thumbsticks, meaning an additional 40+ dollars if you don't buy the steam controller bundle (which has it's own problems)==The list goes on, but this is what needs to be said the most.",0

Negative,"Pros:Great graphicsInteresting conceptRuns smooth without crashes or GPU overheatsCons:No discernible story line at allNo maps (a massively dumb idea for an RPG)Weak magic systemWeak crafting systemBoring fight mechanicsTerrible tutorials and even worse key mappingOne word that would describe this so-called RPG, LAZY. I bought this game based on the positive reviews it received and I was fairly disappointed. I have never played any of the other games in this franchise, but if they are anything like this I will pass. This game is basically an RPG made for console players. The keyboard mouse controls are completely unexplained leaving it to the user to figure out the key mapping, no tutorial or helpful prompts at all except for gamepad controls which is ridiculous since a PC player may or may not actually have a gamepad. It literally has zero story, and I mean ZERO story. There was absolutely no connection to your character and the world itself, the adversity facing your character, nothing at all. Nothing but a bunch of nebulous, vague talk from NPCs that never really explains what is happening, why you are there, or what you are supposed to accomplish. There are no quests, no maps, no quest waypoint markers, literally nothing to guide a player from one objective to another. You basically wander around killing every creature you encounter until you inevitably find a boss type character. Occasionally you find gear or unlock a hidden area, but the whole thing seemed completely unfocused and pointless. I got all the way to the very end and was shocked at the complete lack of payoff. I had absolutely no idea I had finished off the final boss because the lazy writing that went into this game. Everything about this game seems lazy, the script, the objectives, the combat, everything seems created to entice the dumbest dregs of RPG fandom into playing. All you have to do is create a character and immediately just run around and kill everything you encounter. You can even kill the helpful NPCs and it has almost no consequence on game play whatsoever. The combat is very boring, you have maybe three different weapon attacks, and that is it. The magic was completely ineffectual against powerful enemies, the crafting/forging system was so basic and rudimentary I thought I was playing a game made in 2001. The concept of being undead in an undead world is intriguing, but the complete lack of explanation of literally ANYTHING detracts from any of positive points of this game. Even as antiquated as Elder Scrolls: Oblivion is, it is still a better game than this one because at least you knew where you were going, why you were doing it, and had an overall objective, close the Oblivion portals and Oblivion is over 15 years old. This game has absolutely none of the things that makes a good RPG, no character development, no intriguing story, no quests, no maps, it is a sub par RPG made for people who lack the intelligence to do anything other than kill enemies. I probably would not have given it such a bad review if it had marketed itself as a hack and slash RPG, but it tricks you into thinking you are purchasing a legit RPG only to be left wondering at the end of the story ""what did I accomplish?"".",0
Negative,"I want to be clear: I only bought this because I have a lot of faith in FromSoftware and I believe in them, so I wanted to throw money at them.Let s get this out of the way: this is the worst Souls game yet out of all 3. This game was, is and will ever be a mistake from FromSoft, but I forgave them because they are good people and great developers. But they have been lazy and greedy on this installment of Dark Souls.Now then, this is what is good about this game:- Irithyll- Meaningful references to previous Dark Souls and Demons Souls- Great animations- Impressive weapon and NPC models- Mostly great and memorable boss fights- Sword artBad stuff? Oh boy.- Uninteresting NPC dialogs and interactions- Shallow story (not lore)- Copy/Pasted enemies (Not bosses)- Mostly boring level design, everything looks the same except Irithyll- Amazing bullshit factor and broken hitboxes- Meaningless covenants- Massive input inaccuracy due to a stupid AF input queue system (who the hell s idea was this?!)- Some bosses are extremely unbalanced- Most weapons have the exact same design and movesets- No love given to casting classes at all, almost no major armor and spell upgradesThis game doesn t require skill for a player to be good at it. It all depends on luck. Some of the bosses are genuinely challenging like Aldrich, and thats one of the rare stages in this game that I actually thought I died because of my own mistakes. Thats why after 3 times and identifying all my mistakes and rectifying them, I beat him easily. 80% of the game is NOT like that. Dancer of the Boreal Valley? Yeah, she can grab me even if I m a mile away from her. She even hits behind her even if her swords don t go there.I realize most of Souls fanboys aren t exactly the brightest people around and they will rage, but Idgaf, if I can go through this bullshit of a game just because its a souls game and I have to play it, I can handle a bunch of idiots raging on a sincere REAL fan of the souls series.

Negative,"This game feels like a lazy sequel designed to appeal to the O-Muhzaki-sama fanboys and is full of little issues that only become apparent after sinking time into the game.-Most player animations are recycled from DS1 or replaced with something wrist breaking like the two handed curved sword R1. -Rocketboots rolls.-Weapon arts range from mostly useless to gimicky.-PvP feels like a side note.-Covenents are shit.-Borrowed the wrong ideas from Bloodborne and discarded too many good ideas from DS2.-MUH ONIONBRO-Too many throwbacks for that matter.-Player character is a manlet.-Repeats all the mistakes of DS1 plus more!-Muhzaki is a hack who I am convinced stumbled into success with piecing together DeS, recycled DeS into DS1, handed DS2 off to somebody else so that he could work on his new baby Bloodborne, and would have rather worked on Bloodborne 2 than DS3. Based off the lack of effort put into the game, I also don't think From will do much patching like they did with DS2. I could go on, but, much like Muhzaki, I would rather not put in the effort.Edit:I lied! Here's more~~~-Why are players forced to mostly trade when using great weapons? Evading them is too easy.-Why does wearing heavy armor only allow you to take 1 to 2 hits more versus medium armor? This also hurts great weapon users.-Why do most R2s not combo with anything? This significantly reduces options.-Why are i-frames and stamina usage on rolls so good? Because the game was balanced around lazy PvE design, wait and see play styles are too rewarding in PvP.-Why is 69.99 the optimal weight percentage? We used to have a sliding scale.-Why are fast rolls worse than medium rolls in most respects? Medium rolls get freaking hyper armor. -Why are small weapons so fast?

I saw it one of my favourie youtube blogger playing with it and I checked it if it possible to play in coop since I only play games with friends. I never or very rare occasion when I start something in single. Anyway.I see big letters on the site, CO-OP. Ok, lets see.First of all that the huge suck that I had to live through with start of the game to even start playing with friends is one thing. I died I think 80 times. Ok, I'm a clumsy f*ck you can say that and I can accept that I'm not that good player after 37 (around 25 years of gaming) years. Lets say I'm not for this game type. Anyway, after this the real pain started when you have to trick the game of even see my friends sign to invite. Literally we spent 1-1.5 hour sometimes to even see our summoning signs. No user friendly system in any way. And most of the fans saying this is because this is game is hard. No.the hardness is note same with dumbness I think. No real guide in any way. Yes we figured it out ok. So be it. After this whole server lag issue that I found guide with information like 'please do not go to there to put a sign because it is possibility that a not open door could cause an issue with summoning'. Are you kidding? Really? Maybe I should sacrifice a chicken in the kitchen ritually to have lucky enough to summon my friend in a CO-OP game as on the official site saying?No.I don't even start the fact that after we finally started to enjoy the game and accept the fact that we need to kill three times the current area boss to move forward together (because WE WANTED TO PLAY cooperatively and this is why we bought it) after the tree boss a sequence arrived where all of us had to move forward and kill a smaller boss and move toward an area where you cannot invite anyone. Really? A co-op game.really? Ohh when finally moved forward again summoning issues, 2 of my friends cannot join, only one of them, lets try other way, I can join to one of them but the 3rd one cannot. Another 1 hour pure suffering and brain damage. Ok, lets see if we use that damn thing which needed for 4 player (just a reminder we are 3) but who knows wtf is going on in this japanese madness. Yeah.suddenly all the summoning sign appeared and my friend managed to summon us. OMG so great! (no guide, no user friendly explanation wtf is going on since we are 3 not 4 so why we needed that damn Dried Finger but lets move forward.).Then again a fun part since now two player can invade our game where simply wanted to play a story mode co-op game. We manager to kill two invaders. In matter of fact usually we managed to kill all the invaders previously all the time. We can say it is fun. After we killed one invader a counter started probably and we managed to play this twisted co-op (in between us we are not allowed to say this word co-op about this game, it is forbidden.) nicely. Ohh this also ended probably since we are experiencing that after we killed two invaders suddenly again two appeared we have no clue why or maybe when one of us died and re-invited the counter resets and again new invaders arriving. So basically now we couldn't managed to move forward with the story together (in a so callod CO-OP game) because invader pvp maniacs attacked us all the time and they just simply not letting us be and play a damn story together. Nice! So you win and kill everyone without death or you fcked basically. Just forcing me to play PVP (I don't remember if I mentioned earlier: IN A CO-OP GAME as the website saying) without any option. Yeah I know. I read it. Switch off online and pull out the internet cable. Yeah.and play singe which I won't cause I bought this because it is saying Co-OP.maybe I mentioned couple of times, sorry.And you know what? I love the game. I love the atmosphere. I love the view. But technical point of you it is a poor designed poor programmed joke. Or ok.remove the co-op section from the marketing section. And never ever mentioned until you understand what does that mean. p.s. ohh the fact that you have to set the settings all the time because if you don't the game just crash the fck out.lightning detail stuff to low but anyway nothing have been saved if you set up and quite properly. It just put things on random sometimes. When you start the game again.Thank you and sorry",0

Negative,"I really really wanted to like DS3 I loved and put so many hours into DS1 and DS2 but something about this game just did not click for me. I really wish I could point out something in particular, but I just can't. Seeing as how I did not enjoy Elden Ring either I must conclude that this series simply isn't for me anymore sadly.",0
Negative,"Look it's not bad by any means but it's just a deeply unpleasant experience for me. Easily the lowlight of the trilogy in terms of how much I enjoy it, though it's so much more technically competent than either of the games which came before it that it isn't funny.Full acknowledgement of bias here, I played the first two before I played this one and beat the first two before I'd gotten even halfway into this one. Yes, this was the last game of the trilogy for me to get to, and I was already deeply in love with DS1 despite that games' many faults, so this had some things to live up to. But the problem for me is more of a difference in philosophy than anything else.See, Dark Souls 1 is an action game in the way that Fallout: New Vegas is a first-person shooter. That's a technically true description of it, but it's disingenuous to call it that. Dark Souls 1 aspires to be an RPG first and foremost in the same way that Demon's Souls does. Those two games share more in common philosophically with King's Field than they do with DS3 and Bloodborne, even if the core gameplay is fundamentally unchanged. What I mean by this is that they're games that very rarely put you in a room with a big strong man and don't put a twist on the fight, then call that a day. There's always SOMETHING, because it's a throwback to the days of (cryptic bullshit) discovery in retro gaming. It's an attempt to make the experiences of those games translate into a game of modern scope and budget. And the problem (or appeal) of both Demon's and Dark 1 is how much they have to compromise to achieve that vision.In Demon's Souls, you have a boss that's an unimaginably powerful dragon. But you can't just fight him head-on, he doesn't give you the opportunity. The fight is about solving the environmental puzzle of hitting two buttons in order to incapacitate him and bring him down to your level. It's not a good fight, but it's a great example of the way that Fromsoft had to design things back then. Your dragon bossfight is you dodging projectiles from an unhittable enemy until you reduce him to a stationary hitbox that can't fight back.In Dark Souls 1, you have a boss that's an unimaginably powerful dragon. But you can't just fight him head on because he constantly flies overhead and spams fire at you. The fight only becomes realistic once you find a giant archer who cripples one of the wings and forces the dragon to fight you down on the ground. I personally hate the fight still, but it's another example of compromise. It also just so happens to make for a more interesting interaction with the world than if you just fought this dragon straight up. Because you can make a fight with the spectacle of a powerful dragon arcing through the sky and lancing fire at you while you dodge him until he lands, but that doesn't mean it will play well.Anyway, in Dark Souls 3 you fight an unimaginably powerful dragon who has his full moveset and no gimmick and the result is a boss that spends a lot of time stalling while you play the rhythm game of dodging his spam. Because it turns out that just being able to fight a dragon one on one in a straightforward arena leads to a fundamental mismatch of capabilities and movesets and the result isn't very interesting.This is an action game built around spectacle. Any semblance of RPG mechanics are fully and truly dead. It's a fucking good action game, and the spectacle is basically always top-notch, but I personally do not play this series for that. If I wanted that, I would play Bayonetta or Nioh. There is a fundamentally unique experience that Fromsoft has been able to offer with this series, and I just do not find myself gratified by it with this one.There's a hundred other little complaints I have, but there just isn't really a point in listing them. I have a million complaints about Dark Souls 1 as well, but I enjoy that experience still after 100% completing it and something like 250 hours. Meanwhile I find myself fatigued and bored by about a third of that time spent with this one. It was never about getting a polished, flawless experience from the franchise, it was always about getting something I couldn't get anywhere else. With this game, I can get what it's doing elsewhere. The embers remain, but the flame is gone for me. It's too much candy, not enough meat.",0

Negative,"Like its predecessors, this game seems hellbent on delivering a demoralizing and gruelling experience devoid of any true enjoyment. Though the combat mechanics, weapon variety and motion controls fell tighter and more responsive than previous titles, the situations and enemies combine to create curated scenarios of pure frustration for the player. The player is prevented from feeling confident or emotionally invested in the game beyond a dull resignation toward their inevitable countless deaths due to unforseeable, often comically contrived circumstances. The retrying of areas and runback to bosses serve to pad playtime to a disproportionate degree. After beating this game, and it's DLC, let me be the one to tell you that there is very little actual fun to be had while playing this game.",0

Negative,"I'm sure this is an amazing game, I've heard great things about it after all, and I do like a difficult challenging game.However I can't recommend getting this on steam, the port is terrible, it is in no way suited to keyboard and mouse control and I've presently been unable to find a properly functioning mod to do what the developers should have done in making tooltips actually be able to tell you the keyboard inputs instead. Even after working out some of the inputs, the keyboard controls are really nonsensical and it's very obvious the devs spent not a second concerning themselves with that. So if you don't already own and have setup on your PC a controller, then this is not the game for you.",0
Negative,"I've always loved the aesthetics in the Dark Souls, and I feel that Dark Souls III is probably the best out of the series. However, I've come to the the painful realization that I find the game more fun to watch than to actually play it myself. The combat's surprisingly bland for a long time and couldn't keep me interested. I didn't like the control scheme either which still feels awkward after spending hours with it. However, my biggest gripe with the game is the lack of a map for places I've visited, which has me running around trying to find my way due to my poor sense of direction. Also, the game seems to not register my achievements for some reason, though that could just be an intermittent Steam issue.Ultimately, Dark Souls is for individuals with an abundance of patience and time.

Negative,"I gave this game a try to see if the Souls series were for me and, on net, they aren't. It gets its hooks in you well enough and some of its mechanics are clever, but I would say that the amount of time I spend having what actually counts as ""fun"" in this game was minimal-the Abyss Watchers bossfight about a third of the way through the game stood out for being the first time I actually felt that I was enjoying playing DS3, and the fight's very quality brought into relief how little I was enjoying the rest of the game. Too much else of the rest of the game in my opinion conflates tedium with difficulty (case in point: boss runs) and frankly the game just needs more streamlining (as well as more system explanation. I was 2/3rds done with the game before it was made apparent that there's a button for two handing weapons. This in a game that ostensibly has a tutorial!) Relatedly, there are too many items in this game the lion's share of which will never be used (weapons especially, but also the ratio of tedium to expense to benefit for most consumables) and too much overhead involved in leveling (why not allow leveling at bonfires)Having now played through my first Soulsborne, it's big, parts of it are beautiful, some of its systems are good or clever (and others are complete rubbish and nakedly player-hostile) but as an entire experience I don't think those objective characteristics actually translate into an experiences that I would characterize as fun. For me personally-and I realize many FromSoft devotees will disagree-the negatives bite too hard and the tedious parts are too front-and-centered and core to the overall experience to overlook the arguable positives.",0
Negative,I don't see the appeal. It's a few moments of satisfaction buried under being slaughtered repeatedly.,0
Negative,"shit game, shit",0
Negative,"First impressions could have been better. For some reason all the control-prompts are for an Xbox controller but I'm playing with a mouse and keyboard. It took a lot of trips to the controls menu and online tutorials to figure out how to do everything since the tutorial and menus display Xbox buttons. I know Dark Souls has strange design choices, but this tops the list. The other thing I quickly noticed was the low frame-rate. It runs fairly normal with a smaller window at the lowest quality settings. But it slows down during intense fights. Maybe it s a computer problem but I d change your settings if you're having that issue.Things like laggy or unresponsive controls, over-sized character hit-box, lousy enemy hit-box detection and snapping into an enemy's grapple (despite being far from their grasp) are constants. All of which are bugs from as long ago as Dark Souls 1. Are they bugs or just features at this point? Sometimes the camera freezes in place or sways after killing an enemy for up to two seconds. An annoying new glitch when there's more than one enemy and you can t control the camera.It feels like it takes the game half a second for it to understand I've pushed something in some cases. Sometimes, the game queues controls I've pressed to implement them when I'm trying to do something else. I'm trying to dodge but the game has attacks in the queue or vice-versa. Sometimes the lag is so bad after my poise breaks that rapidly pressing buttons isn't fast enough for the game to understand I m pressed anything. Sometimes spamming is slow to react even when poise isn't an issue. I've always thought Dark Souls needs tight controls for the type of gameplay it has, but these games have NEVER had tight controls. You make split-second decisions/movements during combat, but the game sometimes responds at one second per request. I cannot stress enough how bad the combat controls are. It's the real reason Dark Souls is so difficult, not just the enemies you fight. Rolling is also as unreliable as ever. Sometimes the invincibility frames don't work, sometimes it keeps ramming into walls, sometimes it doesn't activate when you need it to. It's embarrassing how half-azzed it is.I'm really don't like how often lock-on turns itself off. Sometimes it doesn't lock-on when enemies are close, sometimes the lock-on range is much longer, sometimes it randomly turns itself off over and over. Which is very frustrating (sometimes every two seconds during a boss-fight). Once had to press lock-on four times at close range before it activated. Not only that, it doesn't acknowledge enemies if they aren't on screen, close to the current target and sometimes doesn't feel like switching targets. Sometimes my mouse creeps out of the game window during combat which causes problems. Sometimes it causes your character to go into auto-pilot and runs off a cliff. The game doesn't pause, so you're kinda screwed. It happens far more often than it should. Like every five minutes to thirty seconds if it really feels like playing up. Sometimes the mouse creeps out and starts opening/deleting things in your desktop while you're desperately trying to get the mouse back inside the game. Playing Fullscreen might fix that but the frame-rate would tank like crazy in my case. Dark Souls really is a unique experience. For the wrong reasons. I swear, these developers are ten years behind in game design. How did they let this slide?I get so frustrated with games that have bad cameras. Here it s often ramming itself into objects, walls, enemies, the ground. Sometimes it erratically zig-zags, causing you to have no idea what the heck is even happening during fast boss-fights. Sometimes it rears so far forward that your character is about two meters (six feet) behind the camera and completely out of view. In a game this difficult, I don't need to add 'fight against the camera' to the list of things I m doing. The plot (lack thereof) is not enough to carry a game like this if the gameplay barely holds up. Some games are so good you can look past glitches; this game comes up short in most areas. After playing this game, I finally understand why the camera generally feels awful so often. It hugs your character way too close; if anything is close to you, you won't know it's there. Enemies about to attack you, walls you're about to run into; it's like an old Crash Bandicoot game. It was irritating then, it's no different now.You know a game is poorly designed when it feels like you're fighting against the controls more than the enemies. But after killing a difficult enemy, you get the great sense of relief that I'm so familiar with in a Dark Souls game. Extra relieving when you were fighting the controls to actually work and they finally did for once. So relieving. And I'm very happy there s an option for offline mode. I've heard hackers can invade your world and corrupt your save file (and steal your personal information). Not sure if that's true but I wouldn't risk it. If it's not the devs, it's the players screwing you over. You just can't have fun with this game, everyone s against you.I'm so sick of enemies that attack without attacking. They're not moving but somehow, you're receiving damage from them. How are you supposed to avoid attacks that have no animation? Wtf? I now understand why some enemies feel ridiculous to fight. Some are very fast while your character is naturally very slow and clumsy. Your top movement speed of about a third of theirs. No wonder some fights feel very tilted in their favour. I don't know how you could fight bosses with anything like a greatsword or bigger. Medium weapons are sometimes way too slow for how fast those guys attack.I think I finally understand why the same glitches have existed in all three Dark Souls games and why the combat still feels so terrible. It's so simple, if you keep dying over and over for stupid reasons, the game feels longer. If you fight a boss fifty times, it feels more rewarding when you finally beat it. The game is intentionally designed to be terrible for artificial padding. That's genius but awful. The game would be plenty long and difficult without the bugs. All the glitches do is make the game feel terrible. But at least the Developers can say their game has a long completion time. Because apparently length is all that matters in a video game. Not fun, not substance, only length of completion. Go figure. I don't get frustrated like this in any game I know. Closest thing I can think of would be the old Hitman games (man, those things were also super buggy).After previously playing two Dark Souls games, this one feels like same sh*t, different day. It follows the same formula without many new ideas. It feels generic at this point. It's like playing a new Assassin's Creed or Battlefield game and thinking ""Hmm. Feels just like the last game they made.and the one before that"". Granted, it isn't identical but it still feels the same. Only thing worse is knowing Demon Souls, Bloodborne, even Elden Ring also follow the same formula without mixing things up. I'd hate to imagine playing six very long games that all feel the same.I'm so glad the final boss-fight wasn't as disappointing as Dark Souls 2. It was what you want from a final boss-fight in a hard game. A cool design and challenging gameplay. It wasn t as difficult/epic as the first game, but still, it was a big improvement over the last. Until I found a way to cheese it which made it laughably easy. Still, very unique boss-fight that I really enjoyed (when I wasn't getting frustrated at the consistently glitchy combat. There are some things that will never change in a Souls game).Welcome to Dark Souls. Prepare to die.from glitches. And ""You just suck at the game"" is the cheapest excuse ever to turn a blind-eye to clearly poor game design. There's a huge difference between intentionally difficult gameplay and intentionally buggy gameplay. Just my opinion.",0
Negative,Where am I even going?,0
Negative,"I enjoy the aesthetics and the general exploration of the map to a certain extent. There are a few parts I've experienced where it is easy to get stuck because there is only one way forward and you might miss it. E.g. I had no idea what was meant with turning off the beacon's. Turns out you need to put out a few candles, which for some reason then also turns off the beacon (that isn't visible until the cut-scene. Oh.The last two boss fights I've experienced have been an absolute terrible experience. A tree that is so huge that it doesn't fit on the screen with janky hitboxes and a bossfight where the best strategy is to run away from the boss for the first minute or so because it'll get hurt in the process. Furthermore, the having to travel back to the Firelink Shrine in order to level up is a dumb mechanic that was better handled in Dark Souls 1 where you could level up at any Bonfire. I do appreciate the bonfires being plentiful and the option to fast travel and have had a pretty good time exploring. Just these last two boss fights are such rage-inducing piles of doo-doo I'm not sure I want to continue playing.",0
Negative,"Cleared the game, dlc and allIt was challenging, but it wasnt enjoyable.Enemies are faster in both attack animation and movement speed, this is artificial difficultyIt does not feel satisfying that there is a huge wind up time before your character starts to swing the weapon, like playing with 300ms latencyYou have to know boss attack animations to decide if you can attack, you have to die repeatedly at a boss to know what moves they might use. There is no attack cancelling, any player that has good reaction time now has the front seat to watch the disaster happen. Enemies attack animation is illogical, delaying attacks, semi-floating in the air before suddenly crashing down, how else would anyone know the timing unless they die once or twice to them.Lastly, a roll with an inbuilt iframe as the main dodging mechanic, either a sword hit my character without actually touching, or I can just roll into the sword to avoid any damage.Never have I see any games that require the players to git gud while dying countless times just to progress the game",0
Negative,"What a piece of junk. It is 2022, this game was released in 2016 for the PC among other platforms. Five years later and they still have not fixed the PC version. You start the game and it immediately dumps you into a server connect. But surprise, they have not fixed the servers (after five years) because they are busy with Elden Ring. So you wait and wait and hit cancel when it finally appears because no, you can't connect to a server. That will finally get you the option to play an offline version.The hint of another problem appeared during the character creation screen. None of the hotkey tips that popped up worked for the PC. I figured out how to proceed (right-click for a drop down menu and you get the choices). I figured ok, there must be a setting to give me the PC version prompts. Nope. I got into the game, took a step, it said hit a particular key to read a glowing message on the ground. So I stupidly hit that key and I drank a potion off my belt instead. So I did some investigation and found that they had never put in prompts for the PC version (ahem, five years). I looked up the keybinds and scribbled them down and they were completely different from most keybinds. That was enough. I did not feel like going through and rebinding every key (ie, A is ""ok"" on the controller and ""move/turn left"" on the keyboard). I tried to quit; hit escape and after scrolling through the list found exit. It insisted on saving upon exit, done. AND it dumped me right back into connecting to a server screen.So, I just stopped it from Steam and I am uninstalling it after this review. I know some of you will say - hey Bhue, why don't you just get a controller? Well I am physically unable to use one - it happens. Anyway do yourself a favor, don't waste your time playing this game to try to catch up to Elden Ring or to see what the gameplay is like. Luckily I got this as a Humble Bundle gimmee in a monthly sub so I paid less than $1 for it. I would hope that they did better with Elden Ring. But after reading some of the reviews, I shelved the idea of that game also. (If I can cheerfully play Star Citizen then you know how this game must rank.)Really, vote with your money. Don't buy a game that is not properly optimized for the platform you intend on using. I can see getting something from a company with a history of optimization, but obviously this company cannot.

It's the worst UI I have ever seen for a PC game.Gameplay 1/10:When you try to move around with mouse combined with keyboards the characters moves very weirdly so you often struggle moving the character in certain directions. The camera also automatically moves around very strange from time to time especially during combat. Sometimes the character also doesn't jump to avoid hits, even if you press the jump button. Developers have invested almost none effort to make a smoth experience for PC gamers. If you are a spell caster you have to lock the target otherwise you will miss 90% of the spells and locking a target causes you to feel extremely unathletic moving around. These issues makes the game almost unplayable. Compare movement with any greater FPS like game for PC and you know what I mean.Summary:It's an extremely bad PC port and the developers should be ashamed.",0
Negative,"ok so after seeing a bunch of videos and hearing people talk about how hard it is , i finally bought this. I gave it too much respect at first and died fast like a little sissy, but I took it seriously and started appreciating its difficulty, i got the STUFFING beat out of me until I learned how to fight and which class suited me best. ok i settled for the knight of course. I started to like it , then love it. But .The one flaw that makes this game unplayable is., the aimbots the ai gets after you start leveling up. after you start leveling up and improving. the ai will gain an unfair advantage but what i don't like is cheap lazy programming . after you get tp like level 15-ish the enemy gets like an aimbot. How? you ask? After I noticed the enemy was literally changing direction mid-swing and trajectory, . their hit box and yours interact different, you can no longer roll and time their attacks, they just home in and follow your movement no matter your timing,I thought OK, maybe Im trippin, and went back to grind a bit to gain souls. nope i proved this by going back to old save points and fought the weak enemy. THey also NOW had this aimbot thing and they were tougher?! my equipment was not damaged, nothing like that, i checked, it's just lazy game developers hoping young players dont know . ive played games since the og nintendo,i know a cheat program when i see one. I uninstalled it btw Sekura does NOT do this, most people complain about it being hard, that's not the complete story. Just being hard is fine. It has to be fair , but I cannot accept an already challenging game that literally cheats. no thanks. games ruined.",0

Negative,"This isn't a game, it's torturelet's start with the basics, everyone knows that dark souls is supposed to be extremely difficult, hell that's what its KNOWN for, with almost every video game reviewer saying any game with any amount of difficulty is ""souls-like"".I will admit that i could not progress much in this game without outside help.I'll start with what this game has done well.The art style is great, the gothic style of a world that almost looks like it's rotting away perfectly suits the difficulty and gameplay style of it all.I don't consider high difficulty a positive,(got the game because i thought it wouldn't be so bad with a friend) but I know that lots of people who play games do so to get past that difficulty, in which case dark souls has lots of it for those masochistic playersThe levelling system is well made, so that if you NEED to get stronger, it's not too difficult, but you won't be gaining levels passively until you're strong enough to beat every enemy out there.;As for the parts this game could improve on,I initially got this game to play with a friend, only to realise that multiplayer isn't allowed without using a consumable item that is limited in stock, and deactivates when you die (which you WILL die A LOT), which also connects you to all the hackers, and people who've played this game for years and will kill you as soon as you see them.On the topic of the other players, the game seems to push the idea of multiplayer, with people leaving notes around the map with messages that could either be a helpful tip, or nothing at all, but the nature of the game itself very much dissuades any multiplayer because anyone who likes the game has played it for years, and will kill a new player on sight. It's impossible to enjoy this game unless you've been playing dark souls since it's release, or you're masochistic.The gameplay itself isn't broken, but is very close to being so. There's a feature that allows you to automatically target onto an enemy, and theoretically attack in the direction of that enemy, but for some weapons (specifically spears/halberds) the targeting is off so that you'll attack just to the side of them. It's especially bad when you add on online delay/lag.If you like difficulty this game should be good for you, but if you'd prefer to ENJOY the game, try something else.tldr: Too difficult, couldnt git gud :( 2/5",0
Negative,"The worst entry in the series. Almost every enemy has a spam attack which stunlocks, their stamina is repulsively high.

Negative,"This game plays like a really good fan release sequal, in that it seems like dark souls, but the level desighn is boring, and the posses have good lore but are desighned really poorly. Ashes of Adriel is a neat story, but one of the most half assed DLC's in soulsborne history. I love dark souls and have tried ona few occasions to get through all the content for this game, and its been a joyless grind every time. The combat is undefinably clunky compared to the other two, enemies have 5-10 hit attack chains with basically no windup or cooldown inbetween, so you spend most of this game just waiting patiently for even basic enemies to finish attacking, because the damage scales ultra high and you cannot upgrade armor. Weapon upgrades are half of what they were in the alst game, and the game is also very very short, with most of its logevity coming from Insta kill traps and crappy level desighn with upwards of 5 enemies at a time in basically every encounter. Play it co-op or dont bother. Also, dont bother because this game has hackers left right and center, and the game will perma ban you for fighting them sometimes, or summoning them as allies on accident. More than any other souls game, this one punishes you for trying to play with your friends. expect to fight 3-4 dark phantoms each attempt at an area, and at least two of them to be hackers with infinite HP and spells that kill you from anywhere on the map.Weapons arts are a cool addition and the spells are interesting, but because of the needlessly high lethality, if you dont min max, then delete your character and start over because you dont get to play the back half. Miss one step on a level and your done with important quest lines, the interesting NPC you wanted to see the story for, they just disappear without any indication of what you did wrong. If you are playing casually, your vendors will vanish and die because of some plot with another character you didint talk to enough, or do some innane thing with, so now you dont get to buy spells or miracles or what have you.This cleans up the dark souls story in a way that barely lines up with the other games, and sort of expects you to not properly remember what happened and where, and leans a LOT on this ""Timelines are foggy"" get out of jail card to excuse the huge holes in logic. That said, there is a bunch of interesting lore in this game, and its at its best when its telling its own story, and not trying to wrap up DS1. There is a lot of neat stuff going on, but the gameplay is such a miserable grind your not really going to want to bother, get in with the lore community and watch some videos, and enjoy it without the game, you will be better for it.",0

Negative,"Playing ds3 as your first ds game will most likely leave you fustrated and unsatisfied. In short play ds1 skip 2 (trust me on this one) and then play 3.I'm only not recommending this game to people who haven not played dark souls 1. If you have, this game is for you. Don't start the series with this game because it is less of a stand alone game, but a love letter to ds1. A lot of the game is filled with references to the first. This doesn't mean there is less or more reused content but you will enjoy it so much more by playing the first game. This game is also a LOT more challenging and may even feel unfair a times. This is a rly good thing for you if youve played ds1 as it steps up the challenge (the first game is not that hard after the first playthrough). But playing 3 as your first will leave u frustraited (trust me my friend is rly good at games but got annoyed at the challange in this game).In conclution, skip ds2 its just bad. Some people try to defend it but the good things ds2 has are heavily out weighed by the bad. if you realy want to play it do it after the first or 3rd one.",0
Negative,"(Disclaimer: my review time comes from the Xbox version of Dark Souls III which has only just recently received a 60fps patch. The majority of my play time has been at 30fps. I have also not finished the game, my most recent playthrough made it as far as Lothric Castle).(At the time of this review there is a longstanding exploit for the multiplayer system that will allow other players to softlock your savegame and render it unplayable VERY EASILY. It is highly recommend that you either play offline or install one of the community made anti-cheat mods such as ""Blue Sentinel"". I won't link it here due to a risk of banning).I will lead my review with summation of my thoughts: if you came to Dark Souls 3 looking for more of Dark Souls 1 from a gameplay perspective, look elsewhere. I cannot recommend this game from a subjective perspective to anyone who enjoyed Dark Souls 1 and 2 for the gameplay.Dark Souls 3 is the most recent entry in the series and it shows. It is extremely graphically pretty, it's sound design (in particular the music) is fantastic, the world is gigantic and filled with new enemies and new weapons/spells to face them with, as well as some old favourites. It is the culmination of years of ideas that From have attempted to refine and perfect.So why is my review marked as ""not recommended""? The gameplay. In particular, the combat.Objectively, Dark Souls 3's combat is very well designed. It's tight, it's fast, it's hitboxes are fantastic and the new Weapon Arts features really allow for some interesting fighting styles. Subjectively I feel the combat is designed to ""punish"" the player more than any other game in the series. Dark Souls 2 punished the player due to a mixture of poor design choices and rushed development. Dark Souls 3's combat was designed from the ground up to punish you.You do not get poise, but your enemies do.You can get staggered by EVERYTHING. Staggering your enemies is a stamina and damage check, one you often fail.Your parry windows are incredibly tight, but for enemies it's more generous.Your stamina consumption on blocking is excessive, but for enemies their stamina is limitless.You are even punished for rolling after a hit with LESS i-frames. Your escape tool is less effective when you're escaping.You can't upgrade your armor. Damage towards the end game becomes absolutely ridiculous.Your enemies will not let up. You have limited windows to heal unless you panic roll as far away as possible and even then they will chase you down.Dark Souls 1's combat gave you a lot of freedom to play how you like. Dark Souls 2 (through both an intent of design AND poor design) expanded those options even further (dual-shielding anyone?). Dark Souls 3 expects you to be as light as possible, roll through everything and enjoy it. Your options for ""tank"" and ""heavy"" are basically no longer existent. In fact through a quirk of the replacement system for poise it is rumored that you are more effective when rolling in HEAVY armor than light.I have pushed to NG+7 and beyond in DS1.I am currently on my NG+2 cycle of DS2.I have tried again and again to even finish DS3 ONCE with no success.And that's where DS3 failed for me. It's not a fun experience. It's a punishing slog where each victory feels Hollow because what comes next is going to be even less fun.I'm quite certain i'm in the minority with this, and that's perfectly fine. If you have more time, patience and skill than I do I can absolutely recommend DS3 especially if you've played the other two and want to finish out the series with a bang. But from a personal perspective I can't stand DS3 and wouldn't recommend it to anyone.",0

Negative,"Think this game only goes down well with a certain player base.I decided to complete the game before writing the review and give it a fair chance.I would have probably picked a neutral review if it was available. The general gameplay can be quite tricky to get the hang off and feels a little clunky the way your character moves but I think it this type of game if your used to playing something like this then you will be fineItems and gear choice are pretty good lots of options there with a mix of play stylesIt's a very vague game, no quests etc to track or any real NPC conversations, there is very little dialogue throughout the entire game. You simply move to an area clear it and kill the boss and move on to next area and do the same again till you kill the last boss in the game which was nothing special.I personally didn't find the boss fights that hard or interesting, the main game was more of a challenge and fun in comparison.They didn't waste any money on cut scenes to explain / further the story or in paying writers to come up with interesting NPC dialogue sadly so the story is pretty poorly executed.I bought this when heavily discounted - I would not recommend paying anywhere near the full price 40 or don't but it at all.",0

Negative,Namco is shit,0
Negative,"The core mechanics are good, but there are so many problems when you look closely at the game that it just pisses me off as the game demands more of you, it also becomes less clear with their mechanics and seems to have no desire to be clear with you. Here's my convoluted summary of my experience with about as much structure as the game seems to have:The mechanics fail to be consistent and fails to be transparent and clear with the player.Any terrain that isn't open and clear is to your disadvantage; I've gotten killed through solid walls by enemies who decided to stick their halberd through a solid brick wall (No, there was no window nor doorway in that wall, and the only aspects I can see of them is the weapon they want to shove through the wall) ; I've tried hiding behind pillars to not get shot and the enemy decides to stick their arm right through the pillar and shoot right through the pillar anyways. Apparently the enemies can noclip shit. Oh if your attacks so much as nick a pillar: stop right there, thank you very much, the enemies don't want your undead touch.I've gotten killed by attacks that visually miss me entirely, yet somehow still manage to hit me.I've encountered random invisible walls when I thought I could be smart and flank the enemy, which instead backfire as I go plunging to my death instead.There are some falls that are instant deaths, and some are not instant death, and the only way to know which is what is to die. The fall distance is not a measure of what is or is not death. It doesn't matter that you have ""negate all fall damage"" or not, nor does it matter that you can see the bottom, nor does it matter if the bottom is normally traversable. If the game wants you to die randomly it will just kill you. One fall I took I went down like 30m, no damage taken. Another 10m one was instant death, as in my ""negate fall damage"" buff doesn't matter, the game just puts you into a game over state.Right, then there's the indicators for the buffs, which fail to indicate how much longer they might last. I've had my ""negate fall damage"" buff disappear on me mid-fall and the game doesn't indicate how long my buffs will last. You can hit friendly NPCs, while enemies do not hit each other.I've had a boss generate poison that did not appear on screen so and can only feel the vibrations on my controller to tell that I'm being poisoned, yet since he is surrounded by it, I also can't attack him so I just have to wait an unknown amount of time before I can do anything.Oh and there's the issue of poison, which in my opinion is just a mechanic that disrespects the player's time. Need to go through the swamp? Well it's filled with poison which can take less than 5s to fill up but if you don't want to be damaged by it, you have to wait what seemed like a full minute for it to clear up so you can then traverse normally. So it encourages you to just sit and wait patiently forever; that's a shitty mechanic.And then there's some random area where you will just randomly start bleeding and won't stop bleeding until the game seems to arbitrarily decides to stop bleeding the shit out of you. If the bleeding isn't random, it's not at all clear what's causing it.Also enjoy illusionary walls with 0 indication that it is an illusionary wall alongside those invisible ones that loves to fuck with you.Apparently there are hidden mechanics in some gear which there is 0 indication in game that they would have it (or is not easily accessible, the help function fails to tell me much). The gear has random grades for scaling that are opaque in their meaning and even then have hidden details behind them either (apparently there are multiple grades of C scaling but are all C scale). I've heard that it was to create ""immersion"" or something, eh no anytime I'm looking at gear I'm not immersed in your story, I'm trying to immerse myself in the mechanics of the game, which is telling me to fuck off and look elsewhere.Gear takes forever to level such that I can't just upgrade anything willy nilly and then they can seemingly randomly change their item requirement so that my plan to 1shot random mobs was stopped because it suddenly changed into a different material I didn't have access to.Then comes the random PVP which keeps interrupting me randomly whenever I'm trying to play or sort my inventory.I've encountered random PVP players with infinite stamina who can infinitely roll and attack whenever.I've encountered warping PVP players who can miraculously ignore my attacks that go through their models and then hit me at absurd distances.Oh right backstabbing, I've been backstabbed in my face and have backstabbed enemies in their faces as well. It's not clear as to where their backs are, and it's sometimes randomly not behind them but on their side instead.Oh continuing on the mechanics that encourage wasting your time: enemy groups. See a group of enemies? Better lure them out one at a time to dispatch them unless you want RNG for them to chain attack you from full to death.Also don't forget that the game can LOCK YOU OUT OF AN ENDING without any warning if you randomly do something. Apparently I sent some NPC to their death but no hints were given that I've done so. Thanks game.Then there are the points of no return, like boss rooms. Some are somewhat clear, some are not at all clear as to which rooms are boss rooms that you can not exit from once you've entered.The game probably wants me to play it with others but I have to say no thanks, I want to play this at my own pace, but the game apparently doesn't want me to tell me how to so I guess I won't.Oh and some of the bosses are lots of dying as you try to guess what the devs wanted you to do against the boss but there doesn't seem to be any indication as to what it wants me to do.The game's narrative is completely forgetful, and the characters. are there? Unless they're not there. I met some NPC that seemed like it was bugged and didn't even spawn for me. Well I said I met them, but I just keep hearing a voice when I enter a certain area that keeps talking to me, but there's no one there.Hard games are fine, but they need to be fair. Games that fail to be consistent and clear with their rules are not fair. Games that fail to be fair are just dumb. If you disagree, and want a truly ""hard"" game then go play any game that scrambles your inputs every 5 seconds. Have fun.Overall: 4/10",0

Negative,can't connect to the sever and also there's no fix about it.keep trying about 15 mins and i give upbad game,0
Negative,"Honestly the worst part of this game is the controls. The bosses make sense, but using items, attacking, and just generally seeing what the hell is going on is nearly impossible.The bosses autotarget you and circle strafe but the game is implicitly designed to make that impossible for you. At slow camera speeds the bosses are basically behind you 99% of the time and your autotarget, inventory and camera management is so bad that the difficulty is not in the game, it is in the controls. I can't believe people actually enjoy fighting with the controls this much.",0
Negative,"this is game is just like like sekiro! its too damm hard. Software has patched it up to where you cant cheat but all the bosses cheat. you have to be good and patient with these type of games they are very challenging.Nevertheless, as much aggravating this game can get, its addicting.",0
Negative,"Don't bother trying it on pc/keyboard, finding out the control is an utter frustration. The 'tutorial' (lol) explains the moves/combos mentioning the xbox controller's buttons so each time you learn a new move you have to go to the settings menu and translate the buttons to the corresponding keys. Also good luck trying to jump on pc/keyboard. Had to google for like 10 minutes to find out such a stupidly basic thing. Auto target, auto aim never worked for me, although they were turned on in the settings (guess you have to manually lock target but never tried it because uninstalled the game after killing the first boss with a sorcerer missing with the spells half the time from point blank range).Character customization is nice, the battle difficulty is okayish I guess if you know the above things.",0
Negative,"Good game but it has a poor optimization, it has a lot of fps drop when you run into new areas, loading previous areas or just fighting against new enemies. Also camera lock it's bad implemented for joystick players.",0
Negative,I just woke up.what happened?,0
Negative,Fuck this game.,0
Negative,"put ds1, ds2, bloodborne into a mixer, you get ds3",0
Negative,"Nobody helps, but everyone wants help. PvP is cancerous and laggy, and unfortunately is probably the only thing keeping this game alive.",0

Negative,"If you're planning on buying this game after playing Elden Ring, don't bother. From turned off the servers and are never turning them back in order to force players to shill out $60 for a far worse game. I hope someone finds a way to send malware over Ring's servers or, at the very least, I hope From goes bankrupt because this is inexcusable.",0
Negative,"A gorgeous crown upon the work Dark Souls and Dark Souls 2 gave to construct a world full of intrigue and power plays.Not your power, of course, that's something you've got to forge yourself if you hope to get anywhere.Sure, you'll probably do a lot of crying or yelling, but it's the cost for a type of satisfaction that you can rarely obtain any other way.But also summons are good and there if you need them. There's no shame in some jolly cooperation.",0

Negative,"not for casual player , not torturing yourself",0
Negative,"Don't buy the BS that you are lazy and a bad person (TM) if you don't like being killed in one hit , repeateatly, by the first boss. It's designed to destroy your self-esteem so From Software will make money at your expense.",0
Negative,I played this game for 26 hours 100% loved it nothing really about was bad but my major problem wasn't the game but the developers! I got banned for no apparent reason I try to reach out to them but no way can I now due to the virus so I guess I'm fucked,0
Negative,"I absolutely love every FromSoft game. DS1 and Bloodborne are my favorite and I've beaten all of them without summoning, including this one with optional bosses (so I've ""gotten gud""), but this is easily FromSoft's worst game. Still better than most games but this game breaks the inherent ""tough but fair"" motto that makes SoulsBorne games the best. Enemies have infinite stamina, a ton of poise and this makes all but the fastest weapons unusable. Also every area is designed the same, filled with a gank squad that you need to kite, which is fine in general, but gets repetitive and uninteresting quickly. Combined with the lack of viable weapons this game actually feels like a chore to play. In summary, easily FromSoft's worst game. Recommend avoiding.",0
Negative,"The least of the souls series. Tries to ape its contemporary (Bloodborne) poorly. Lacking the magic of the original Dark Souls, the attempted innovation of the second or the excuse of originality the prequel (Demon's Souls) had. Pretty with generic 'epic' music in the right places. It is better on pc than console, but that's not a high bar. Play Dark Souls or its sequel before this sad whimper of an ending.",0
Negative,"Terrible PC port that is unplayable without a controller. All button hints are for controller, so even navigating the menus is virtually impossible, let alone playing the actual game. Most keys can't be rebound properly, and the ones that can keep resetting themselves anyway. If you happen to have the exact controller the developers want, the game may well be decent. But if you have the wrong controller or don't use one at all, the whole thing is simply unplayable.",0
Negative,Terrible PC Port.Controls and lack of keybinding accessibility is beyond stupid.Why the fuck can't i use the scrollwheel to change targets?Why the fuck would that Target lock also be tied to camera rotation?Honestly what a fucking joke.,0
Negative,i didn't lost it shine after a while.Magic system is worse than 2.,0
Negative,My character got hacked after 60 hours of play had to delete character and than the game. Still the game says i have bad content!,0
Negative,"Note: Played with mouse and keyboard. This issues may not be present with controllers. The game feels like a more polished and refined version of Dark Souls 1 which is great. However, for a significant amount of time, the camera was making the game functionally unplayable for me. Even at minimum sensitivity, the camera was far too fast and there was a nearly constant jitter that made me feel motion sick (something that almost never happens). Additionally, the camera seems to absolutely shit the bed on any sort slanted surface; You want to angle the camera downward or upward to see up or down the angle, but the game seems to fight this. More than once I've had to fight enemies seeing pretty much nothing other than their shins or just the tops of their heads. Any camera issues were more or less resolved with mods (thank God for DSFix), but this seems to be unwise, if not impossible, with DS3. From what I've gathered, literally any sort of modification to the game opens you to be banned. Apparently even a mod that let you remove ""illegal"" items from your account that have been given to you by hackers can put a target on your chest for From's/Bandai's overzealous banning action. Also, it's worth noting that all the enemies (at least the ones I've seen) move SIGNIFICANTLY faster than in Dark Souls 1. This wouldn't normally be a deal breaker for me, but when I'm fighting with the camera so often, I often get hit/killed by attacks that I couldn't adequately see the small windup of, and then their faster attack leaves me with not enough time to react. Overall a rather frustrating experience, but if you play with controller you may enjoy the game significantly more.Edit: Finally found a mod which solves the camera issue for me. Unfortunately, the use of it technically opens me up to getting soft banned. So that's kinda shitty. But at least I can play now.",0
Negative,"If you are progamer and able to play EXTREEEEMELY hard games, yeah this is for you. But if you are an average gamer this is absolute WASTE OF MONEY you even cannot pass the first boss",0
Negative,An ok game but the lag is terrible,0
Negative,Too far to go to Boss. It's too boring.I never buy Fromsoftware game ever.,0
Negative,"If they were going to do a PC port, they could port it to PC properly. They're not some two bit indie company with two devs living on coffee money, so have it use PC controls properly instead of some weird reverse keymapping to a controller nonsense. I'm assured there's a good game underneath, but in order to not risk a refund on the amateur shit I've witnessed I can't waste time digging to find it.",0
Negative,"I have to say I was curious about this game because I read and heard a lot about it. Also I wanted to play something challenging.But I guess the PC port of this game is some sort of a practical joke. the game will tell you what controls to use on your playstation controller. and if you use mouse and keyboard, it will still tell you what controls to use on your playstation controller. You have to look up the keyboard controls in the settings and then guess from the playstation control settings what key you SHOULD have pressed before the boss killed you.The sound output is interupted by strange (and loud) cracks, turning down the volume won't help (I'm using a brand new Corsair VOID Elite headset.).If I had paid the full price for that game I would have called it a rip off.",0
Negative,"At the point a game is hard, it s challenging and it s a nice feeling to get progress. But at the point a game is just frustrating for purpose it s not a good game. I played this game for a few hours now and I m in Irithyl.I played it about 70% of the time with 2 friends and it was pretty funny at that time, but alone it s just frustrating and simply a bad singleplayer game to me. But it s very cool to play it with friends in coop or PvP i guess. I have to mention that my friends have played this game way longer than me and finished it so they are a little bit over leveled, also in PvP and I don t know if the game is that easy when you and your friends both just started the game, but in my case it was funny in coop and bad in singleplayer. Hope I could help :)",0
Negative,not worth :(,0
Negative,THis GAME IS SHIT DONT BUUY YUPOLULK NEVER LOSE YOUR VIRGINITY,0
Negative,"If you're someone who has never played a DarkSouls game and are thinking about trying one, do yourself a favor and buy the first game remastered edition instead. If you have played a DarkSouls game before, this one is the easiest combat-wise yet also the most confusing. Unlike the first one I was constantly telling myself ""Now where the hell do I go?"" There's random, extremely obscure items you need to get into certain areas in the dumbest places. In order to continue the game I need to buy this key from an old hag who never leaves Firelink shrine after giving her an item first. Really?I never had to look anything up to beat the first game, I could just play it and enjoy the challenge. Get ready to use Google to beat Darksouls 3, you need to. I don't like the mechanics changes from DS1, I don't like the map and characters as much, the bosses are almost boring, it's just as hard to play with friends as the first one, and there's nothing that makes me want to continue playing. I was hoping for a game that built upon the first one in a positive way and made the game more compelling and fun for all the hype, but it did not.",0
Negative,"My game crashes all the time and none of the 'fixes' have remedied this. The idea that in order to play the game I have to put the graphics down to low is ridiculous anyway, when my gpu can easily handle higher. Likewise, the suggestion of 1080p rather than my monitors 1440p (Mine actually defaulted to 4K and downsized and it was fine until crashes). If the game isn't stable at that resolution why give me the option? It's a kick in the nuts when it looks pretty and crashes so I have to try it on potato settings. When it's not crashing it runs very smoothly at max settings. Back when I had a GTX 1060 I ran the game no worries. now with my 1070 Ti not so. There is still a decent community, in fact I would say bigger than when I first played. If you're a new player, be warned that you will encounter many twinked players invading in the first area with much better gear than you. Just do it un-embered and progress, or out-level them. It is a fun game if you're able to play it stably, I'm mainly giving it a down vote because my salt levels are high atm, and the above is something that I think people should know before buying it so they can make an informed decision to purchase.",0
Negative,"Good game as a single player experience, but online is full of cheaters.",0
Negative,game is shit thats it,0
Negative,OOH I SWEAR IF MY SAVES GET DELETED AGAIN. ITS HAPPENED 3 TIMES MAN.,0
Negative,every time i try to play the game it will start show a white screen then tell me windows had a problem starting it and it has to close the software.,0
Negative,"This looks like a cool and fun game. Unfortunately, I can't get past the poor job they did porting the controls to mouse and keyboard. They still reference all the console controls in the game itself - which means that I have no idea how to do any of the moves that they teach you. This is a barrier to entry for me, so I can't recommend the game.",0
Negative,Great game if you like doing the same fights over and over. Maybe its fun for a kid with tons of time. I wouldn't recommend this game for guys that work all week long and want some stress relief.,0
Negative,cant play with friends without hackers too.,0
Negative,Why does this not support cloud save?,0
Negative,got banned for having fun. also poise is 'working as intended' so STR builds mad >:),0
Negative,"no borderless, capped at 60 fps, no cloudsave",0
Negative,"I am poorly disappointed with the quality of the game. The developers took minimal time to balance certain aspect and fix bugs that may affect the gaming experience, I have had many failed relationships because of a dog teleporting on top of my character numerous times hence losing my 5200 souls. This game needs better multiplayer so you don't have to suck the pavements c*ck just to play with your mates.",0
Negative,"Absolutely brutal game, and imho, a total waste of money unless you're just a glutton for abuse. All these reviewers say just get good but that's bull. The game most certainly does NOT reward perseverance or resilience. The game is sadistic. But they are right about one thing though, this is probably the most difficult, tedious, painful game you will play (maybe ever).Don't waste your money if you don't like hours of trying and re-trying, and re-re-trying, and then trying again to get past hard bosses and other enemies. You can't load an early save and expect to avoid a fight (or just avoid any mistakes) and you don't retain any consumables after loading a saved game (health/ember). Anything you've done is still in play even if it was a mistake and you need a do-over. I played (struggled/labored) on the PC version for 6 hours just to get to the fire keeper at the very beginning of the game (just after the first boss). Then I was stuck in an endless loop of hawkwood repeatedly killing me and then reloading in the same spot just to have him running over to kill me again.The inventory menus are confusing, the controls suck (can't bind some keys like the capslock key), tips and tutorials are a joke and not informative (why do I have to see icons and help for playstation controls whenever I interact with something (even if this is a port), the camera keeps spinning around on its own during combat, and the 3rd person perspective is just a beating to get used to.",0
Negative,"Just like all teh souls games, watch out for the twinks! There really is no way to deal with that other than go it alone, so, just watch out.There are some really good players that can go through a great deal of the game with low level and gear that allows them to invade the starting players.They will kill you. There is no doubt.""git gud"" is the only thing the community will say.",0
Negative,what a load of crap all the prompts are for a controller it is sold as a pc game.this is one if not the worst game i have played the only saving grace is i bought during a sale so it was not too expensive all the reviews say it is a wonderful game it is not0 out of 100,0

Negative,"I bought the game back in May 2016, been in my library ever since. 3 years later i receive a notification saying my steam code was revoked, what took 3 years for them to screw me over? I haven't been told why, or heard back from steam support. This is modern day thievery.",0
Negative,"Playing on a pc with a Geforce 1080 GPU, i7-6700k CPU, 32GB of RAM, on LOW graphics settings, and it takes 5-10 minutes to load the game. Freezes randomly throughout the game even when there are no enemies. I can play every other game in Ultra settings with no issues. Freezing will last anywhere from 30 seconds to multiple minutes. Reinstalled multiple times, wiped and reinstalled my OS, changed all my Nvidia settings, windowed and full screen mode doesn't make a difference. This game is pure garbage on PC. Gameplay is great when it works, if only it would work every time I play it.",0
Negative,"Bloodborne and Sekiro show just how much the online portion of Dark Souls held it back. From one souls game to the next, they'd try to reinvent their matchmaking system and it was always controversial. Be it twinking, hacking, Soul Memory, or just the lag that plagues every single online encounter, it really drags the experience down. Sadly, DS3 also forces you to have to engage with it every time you kill a boss.I tried revisiting the souls games. But by the time I got to this one, I realized just how happy I was that From Soft had learned their lesson and moved on. If you want a better souls like than Dark Souls, just play one of From's other titles. I can tell you that even after hundreds of hours with them, the Dark Souls games are just a lesser experience.",0
Negative,"Just started this game and i believe this is a great game, but my problem is the false advertisement of being a coop game, me and a friend just bought this game purely to play together and we didnt want a singleplayer game. but coop is a pain in the ass! your only able to join a game if the host has a ember to spend, these embers are rare and the beginning and you need alot of them! everytime you die you are going back to your own world and another ember needs to be spend, also after killing a boss you going back to your own world and it needs another ember to join. this is ruining the coop experience for us and we asked for a refund for this after find this all out in 6 hours playtime. so if you want to buy this game purely for coop think twice.",0
Negative,"game is very difficult on keyboard and mouse would recommend a controller, also the game does not tell you the controls for keyboard and mouse you have to figure it out on your own which can take a while, another thing that bothers me is that the hud controls are for the Xbox 360 controller none for PC. i refunded this game because of this and i don't have a controller but if you do then it is a great game would recommend.",0

Negative,Cant play game constant crashes tried all fixes,0
Negative,Game is fun and amazing. It was my intro to the souls series and because of that is why I don't recommend it. The game is fun but dear god the pvp is shit. Just shit. It's nothing but ganks and even when you take out a gank the host resummons. Yea everyone complains and some say kill the host while they have phantoms. But I can't recommend a game while one if it's biggest aspects and one of my favourites sucks.,0
Negative,I bought this on sale. I put 40.7 hours into it according to steam. It seemed a lot longer. I enjoy a challenge. I don t want my hand held while playing a game. I can t fault the game. I just didn t enjoy it or get into this game. I played it more because I spent money on it than actually wanting to play the game. I still have not finished the game as it has become a chore to play. It has been relegated to the dusty corner of games that I wish I never bought. I miss the days that game developers would release demos so you could get a better idea if you would like the game or not. In my option it is not worth the money. So sorry I wasted money on this.,0
Negative,"This is a game that I love to play. Wish that every time that i wouldn't play the game and just let it set the i wouldn't lose All of my saved data. 190 hours into this game for three characters that were all over leave 120 easy. Payed for and beat all the dlc and enjoyed it. However I wouldnt tell anyone to get this game for the simple fact that you would have to restate from the beginning if you ever don't pay attention to it. I really dont get how this game does it, two mouths ago I got one and my data was there and it worked fine got on today and nothing. I done with this bs if I could I would get my money can for the game and all the dlc.",0

Negative,"I used to be a really big dark souls fan and a year ago, I probably would've recommended this game, but if you really think about it, the entire dark souls series is just average. The main reason why I think dark souls has become so popular is that it's become imfamous (and also famous) for being extrememly difficult, but dark souls isn't even the best game in regards to being difficult as fuck, but somehow it's the best selling game in that subgenre. The fight clubs were fun though, I miss hosting those.",0
Negative,"if u get soft banned there not really any point in continuing dark souls 3, there are solutions but they are time comsuming and irritating if you intend on buying this game make sure its on sale. its a great game, being a dark souls fan myself i love playing it, but the online banning system is trash even if you dont cheat or hack you may still get banned, even if you got unbanned theres a chance you could get banned again and if that happens its permanent.",0
Negative,I'd love to enjoy this game if the macro stutter stopped being a thing. For now this game was a collosal waste of money. Good thing I got it for cheap.,0
Negative,"I would love to love this game, but i cant play it. it makes me sick, like motion sickness. i have never experienced this on any other game, and no mattter what i try with the setting i can fix it.",0
Negative,"I went in hoping they fixed the main issues from the first one regarding keyboard controls and was sorely mistaken, there are no instructions involving the keyboard, xbox controls only. The camera is just awful, it's half the battle just trying to use it. You can't look around while mid-swing animation and the camera just goes off in random directions at times. The actions are all delayed from the time you actually want to do them be it swinging your weapon or trying to dodge. The enemies are ludicrously difficult, which would be fine if all other aspects of the game worked halfway decently. The level design is also terrible, making you walk to one end of the room just so the fog dissipates one the other. I know dark souls is supposed to be difficult, but broken is muchdifferent than just difficult.",0
Negative,"Unplayable!I'm sure the game is great on a console, but unfortunately it's just not usable on PC! It keeps saying to press A or B or L1 or whatever, but I don't have a gamepad - I'm using a keyboard. The only option is to print out the list of keybindings are use them as a reference, since they are not consistently mapped - i.e. in once place A is E, but in another A is Q. unfortunately the list of keybindings in the game only shows you the ones you can change, which isn't all of them. I tried randomly pressing keys, but it kept opening stuff I didn't know what it was, and eventually I had to alt+f4 as I couldn't even find a quit button!I am very disappointed. If a game is going to map half the keys on the keyboard to specific things, they very least they could do is provide a tutorial to start with.",0
Negative,The EULA was so long I ran out of time to play.,0
Negative,i get motion sickness of this gamecamera control is utterly bad,0
Negative,"The game looks fun but the constant stuttering and framerate hitches make it unplayable. I've tried a lot of things and the issue persists.edit, after completing it:It also crashes a good bit. Fun.It's okay, it's sort of fun, and looks and feels good. But I'm not sure why they felt every encounter needed twice the number of enemies, and every boss fight needed twice the number of phases, than would have been actually fun.",0
Negative,"I've heard good things about the game and the series but I'm just truly amazed at how terrible of a port it is on PC. It doesn't even change any of the XBox controller icons over to the keyboard/mouse and the camera view mixed with keyboard controls is downright terrible. I don't mind being frustrated with game mechanics, but the controls take away any possible fun I could have.

Negative,"if you like dark souls. play offline. every player on this (invaders) just runs away like little bitches, not to mention the community is so fucking toxic. so yeah play this offline, players on this are shite, and just look on youtube to find builds! or the mass amounts of hackers that have recently infected the game,from software do not care if you hack so you might aswel.",0
Negative,"I won't recommend dark souls 3 to a new player because it has nothing new to offer that the other games did not.It's a new story(ds1 was better in my opinion) and some new areas.Dodging systemThe dodge system sucks! it's so confusing sometimes the enemies hit you while dodging and you character screams but doesn't take any damage sometimes your character screams and dies like it should have been in the first place! :)If you said the dodge system was broken on ds 2 well. this is worse.(i mainly play on dodge rather than parry and using shields so i don't know about that system if its better or worse)Attack systemThere is a ""new"" system with some weapons are acting as dual wielding and some others have a different unique style when you use them on both hands and that goes for all the weapons.Also the weapons now have a special skill that most times cost energy for some retarded reason it's called Focus points.*it's not new system because it's from BloodborneThe armor stays the same.and now u cant upgrade themThe upgrades on weapons are so easy nowmaking a raw infused weapon could be done so easy it will take about 20 min to do so and 1-2 plus for your first weapon of choice!and since you can't upgrade armor your only focus is your weaponswhich is kinda lame because making your weapon any good especially on ds 1 was waaaaaaaaaaay harder than this.I don't want to spoil the story but you kinda have to die about 10 times to progress one quest linethe game doesn't explain anything as always but you kinda have to it before you progress a lot on the gameand to do so it's harder than farming souls. because now to suicide or to watch the great view from the firelink like in the older ds you have to wait 15-30 secs on a freaking ssd for the game to load that area and even if you were outside and you stayed inside in the bonfire for about 10 secs you will have to deal with the fog walls AGAIN!The fps is ONCE AGAIN locked to 60 and when i start the game or minimize it the it also changes to 60hz and that is causing a lot of screen tearing and you have to modify nvidia settings to fix that bug.The most annoying thing is the enemies screaming.Some enemies scream so loud and it's so freaking unnecessary.They sound about 10 times more than your weapon hitting the wall!It isnt even scary it's just annoying!I really don't want to support fromsoftware since they released Scholar of the First Sin for half of the ds2 price and didn't include it on season pass it was a big slap to the face for anyone who bought season pass offering about 2-3 items some ""extendent"" story with a better ending and dx11. They made the EA look good.I really want a new dark souls game that doesn't include the same stuff from any other dark souls game i am tired of watching the same ds armor with some reskin and minor improvements from another ds game or from freaking bloodborneok with that saiddark souls 3 is like any other dark souls with a different story the same items and again different dual holding weaponsthat about itthe areas is like dark souls 1 and bloodbornethe traps aren't surprising at alloverall its disappointing for me because a grow tired of the same stuff again and again i want to see something worth paying for if you are just looking for a new experience you won't get much from here! try Nioh(its a bad PC port tho)",0

Negative,"Bad port. Controller prompts only even if you want to play on KB+M. Stuck on 60fps. Wasn't a fan of the second one and although this seems a little better with the controls, it's still hot garbage, especially if you like using keyboard and mouse, or if you want more than 60fps (144hz screen). I don't get the love for this game.",0
Negative,"I've sunk a lot of time into this game, so it should be clear that I do like the game itself quite a bit.This port can eat shit, though.Let me clue you in on how the framerate goes with this game. On PS4 (where I first owned it), the game runs at 30 FPS. sort of. It dips and flips here and there, but it's never something that interferes with general gameplay. And lag seems to be hard to come by. On PC? It can run at 60 if you have a good setup, of course, but it will never stay that way in combat. Every time an attack is laid out, it's like the game has to struggle to understand how to output it. And online? Forget it. Even some 1v1s in Undead Match can have lag, where you and the other guy are the only enemies rendered. Elsewhere, the lag is a nightmare. I know it's harder to set things to a standard since it's easier to set something up for PS4s, which all have the same routers built in, than for many different makes of PCs. But certainly it could be better than this?Overall, though, great game. Don't like it as much as Bloodborne, Demon's Souls, or Scholar, but it's still solid, a good 7.0.",0
Negative,"Such a bad game and good game in one.I hate the map design, you easily miss everything and miss so many Items, in Dark Souls 2 it wasnt like that but therefore the fight system Swords etc. with their abilities in Dark Souls 3 look and feel amazing.However, this game sucks tso bad, people with high end armor and swords invading me in the first ""area"", letting me die +4x (Or even more dont remember.)Kinda sucks, also the map design and the spawnareas of the enemies are really fuked up. they spawn so bad I do not feel comfy playing this.So in the end I rate this a 4/10 Stars.Also, Dark Souls 2 and Dark Souls 3 are defnitly not the same games nor the title are same.Dark souls 2 play and is completly different from Dark souls 3.",0
Negative,"It's a fun game, but incredibly overrated. Numerous sections of the game are redundant, senseless in design, RNG heavy, or just plain bad. Many, many sections. There are several bosses within the game relying solely on a gimmick or RNG, with instances like Ancient Wyvern and Princes being prime examples of just bullet hell luck, or being screwed by the wyvern uncontrollably moving its head inches away for the dogshit gimmick you use to kill it. I cannot genuinely recommend this game to casual, or even most hardcore players. After the beating the game several times, I will continue to play it since I have learnt incredibly stupid methods to counteract the parts of the game which are just plain bad design. If you are new to Dark Souls, don't play this.",0
Negative,"Perhapse this game would be good on a console by console standards, on a PC this game is just a very poorly made console port.I got this game on a sale which makes it less of a problem that i bought an awfull game, however this game is not even close to worth the money they are asking for it.",0
Negative,"For some reason my review disappeared so here's another one, albeit abbreviated from last time.In one sentence, it's a promising game and it looks stunning, but it's ruined by flawed controls (which also coax you into using a controller) and no difficulty settings. You can only try to conform to the one difficulty that's present, so if you don't usually play these kind of games, like me, you're not in for a very good time. You're not getting to explore the world because you'll be stuck in fights all the time.It's not like it's enjoyably difficult, either. You're just left to grind each type of boss and enemy 'till you get it right. It's frustrating and unrewarding, and very little else.I don't really understand why there isn't a difficulty setting. It's effectively cutting off a huge portion of your potential playerbase, but for what, notoriety? It makes no sense and is just a needless loss.Visually amazing but not enjoyable due to the high difficulty being the only playable one.",0
Negative,"I picked this game up with the steam controller bundle, mainly for the controller so I am not inclined to try to love this game but it had good reviews, was on sale, and the controller was cheap.So when I first ordered it, of course, did not yet have the controller, so tried playing with mouse and keyboard. And well, the movement during combat was kinda clunky. Clearly all the menus and tutorial tips were designed for controller so I waited until I got the controller to try playing again and still, really clunky.Its similar to Elder Scrolls combat which I like and prefer to the targeting combat systems of many rpgs, but this game controls just aren't as intuitive as Elder Scrolls.Perhaps with more time invested I could adjust to it but with steam's 2 hrs play time and no refund, I wasn't willing to risk it always being an obstacle to having fun. Additionally, the enemies are not easy right off the bat so looking at a lot of dying just to get used to the controls.",0
Negative,Very fun game for singleplayer and co op with friends. If your just playing for that your probably going to be fine. But there is a huge cheating problem with the dark souls multiplayer so dont be suprised if you get banned for doing nothing. The publisher repeatedly blames the players for getting banned. Even when its not their fault that someone invaded them while the invaders were cheating causing the host to get banned. This didn't happen to me but there are plenty of stories and videos out there that show that it does happen. Again if your in it for just co oping with your friends your likely going to be fine and will probably find that the game is rather fun and enjoyable.,0
Negative,"tldr:this is actually not a bad game, but if i can rate in number, this is 8/10but why i downvotes? it because the bad pc portingthe console version, i would rate it 8/10but pc version? its 6/10this game is beautifully designed, and gameplay is challenging. one thing bothers me is some gears or spells are only reasonably farmed on pvp content.but the bad thing is the pc porting, not the actual game design itself. i got frame drops, bad framerate, delayed input, on a lot of areas. not a pleasant thing considered this is very timing tight action base game.also, keyboard input layout on this game is odd, some weapon cannot do weapon arts because of that. better you use that USB game controller",0

Negative,"Broken game, drops to single digits on the graphical settings tab until it kicks you out of the game outright for the low framerate that it, itself, caused because it's a broken game. There's no trouble outside of that tab, but you shouldn't have to sit there and pray that you can make your changes before the game decides you're not allowed to play it. Besides, this game blows anyway. Go play Demon's Souls, it's where this game took all of its ""new"" ideas anyway.",0
Negative,"Difficulty 9/10PVE rating 8/10PVP rating 3/10Server stability/lag 2/10 (unfit for pvp)I can not emphasize this enough:DO NOT purchase this if you are interested in pvp content. It is highly duel meta focused and group pvp or invasions are highly skewed to the advantage of the person being invaded.If like me you purchased this for the pvp content that many have talked about regarding Dark Souls 2 you will be severly dissapointed and I promise that once you have farmed up all the upgrade materials for innumerable builds you will find that you have wasted not only your time but also your money.I am not a prior Souls player, and so the nostalgia of the previous games and the depth of lore in the game are missed on me a bit. I don't want to leave a long winded review, however, I would recommend that if like me you are interested in solid pvp content then DO NOT purchase this game.The pve content is challenging as is the consensus for Dark Souls games, however, after trying multiple builds and playing through about half of NG+ I became bored quite quickly. There are quite a few side quests and I believe I've completed at least 90% of what the game has to offer.I will likely not being playing any more due to the horrid pvp. It's extremly easy to win by playing the meta, however, you must resort to dueling to have any fun or play with friends and wait to troll invaders.",0
Negative,"UPDATE: the amount of hackers has made this experience absolutely unbearable, with the amount of time it takes to make new builds you would be lucky not to run across one if using online. These guys have entire discord servers dedicated to fucking up your game as permanently possible, and the devs do little to nothing to fix the issue. If the nerfs and patches didn't fuck up the invading aspect enough, the cheaters will. Join a world with a sick weapon that used to be able to pick off gankers? Not any more, now you will get pounded into dust within seconds and staggered by straight swords and spears. Even better, if you manage to overcome the hosts friends in a 3v1 and get it down to just you and him he can run away and summon them again and again. Manage to overcome the onslaught of the hosts phantoms he spawns in? Guess what, prepare for him to completely crush every effort you put into the fight and toggle his cheats so he can insta kill you so his massive ego doesn't get harmed. This happens nearly every game and it needs to be fixed. This is not to mention the hackers that can enter your world and kill your bosses and important npc's basically forcing you to replay the entire game again, or the ones that corrupt data or break all of your gear forcing you to repair. Look at the nearly 600 hours i've put in after my older review and understand I love this game, especially it's single player offline aspect. But this game has chosen to favor the assholes and hand hold the host more than I ever thought it would end up doing so. The duels are nice but invading was my favorite.With nearly 300 hours sunk into playing this game and learning it in and out I'm confident I can recommend it and say it's a must buy. First of all the thing keeping a lot of people away from the souls series is intimidation. While the gameplay is different and challenging I would not let this keep you from giving it a try. The game is entirely fair but does require skill to succeed but in turn it rewards you heavily.To summarize dark souls 3 I would say that it is a challenging game set in a mysterious medievil universe filled with monsters, magic, epic characters, and amazing levels. Combat requires quick thinking and learning from your mistakes. You can block, roll, dodge, attack, counterattack with the many different weapons available in the game. You can pick different classes at the beginning but you can also level any stat so as the game goes on you can turn your character into anything. Mixing and matching weapons, spells, shield, and even items for your character adds an insane amount of replayability especially due to the multiplayer. The game is like a mix of zelda, metroid, elder scrolls etc. The level design feels like one long journey and is the best and most masterfully crafted of any game. Shorcuts are cleverly placed into the world and make the game feel even more connected, and some of the scenery is downright breath taking (in a destroyed and medievil looking way). This is a game that never holds your hand, and explains the story and mechanics through the gameplay itself.PVP works by in game items that allow you to team up and join other people's world via a white stone (white phantom). Or choose to face the odds and invade another person's world with a red stone (red phantom). This is all done in the hosts campaign and enemies will still very much attack you. This makes for some insanely chaotic and fun battles seeing as how red phantoms can turn on team mates as well. While this opens up the possibility of being double or even triple teamed it's still fun and you can turn the odds in your favor with the right amount of skill.This is a must buy. If you are hesitant don't wait. Get some hours in before the last dlc rolls out and experience this series. Learn about it and become addicted like I and many other fans have.",0
Negative,"1, 2, 3 and you are out. Dark souls has been a terrible line of pc ports and while this may be the best yet it should in no way be praised. Once again, key binding is limited and some it offers don't straight up work. I have heard this game being described as hitbox P*rn, after an hour in and realising both i and a skeleton could hit each other through a thick stone wall which shortly followed by a dragon who breathed two types of fire, the one you could see and the one you couldn't, gotta say dropping dead because nothing hit you, no effect around your character, is one way to ruin one's experience of what is meant to be a challenging game based on skill. I done a quick look incase it was my pc and realised, no, it's just the game.So rant aside, if you could like and play the other dark souls then this one might be the best yet.Graphics are poor for a AAA game of the time, art style is good though.Combat is same as it's always been, bugs, pixel errors and the most common, impatience is what will kill you, the actual fighting is literally just be patient and be ready to roll. (Should note i have completed DS 1 on console and played probably just short of half of DS 2, so i may not have the fully developed opinion on the matter but it hopefully it is enough.)You NEED a controller to play which is irritating but nothing new and sad for a game this popular.I do wish FromSoftware bad luck in the future, 3 bad pc ports for a game that is meant to be all about challenge, unless this is their cruel joke for making it harder for keyboard and mouse players then it's just stupid. A tag should be put on the game to warn it is controller only as what it offers is not enough to make it playable with keyboard and mouse and the lack of visual support for it would be enough to chastise an indie game but for a AAA it is just depressing.I have seen indie games do better ports and it's bug's + pixel errors ruin it, dying because you didn't know what was about to happen or because you miss stepped is fine, dying, being put back 5 mins because the game was terribly developed yet wants to charge 40?! That's just about enough for me to justify refunding it for.",0
Negative,"Shit Souls 3: Prepare to Read EditionThis game is great but the more I replay it the more I realize its insufferable, glaring, un-fucking bearable flaws. Dark Souls 3 could be great but it chooses not to be. It's no more than a shitty monster mash of bloodborne-themed enemies with ""dark souls"" gameplay. The result? An unbearable pissing mess. Rolling should not be fucking spammable. I fucking hate how shitty and weightless my rolls feel compared to the first game. I fucking hate how there's no incentive to go for a fast rather than a mid roll. It's fucking stupid and unnessecary that every stupid fucking enemy has to shriek like a banshee before engaging in combat and HAS to have a stupid fucking endless combo attack. It's no fucking fun how obsolete some of the weapons and classes are. People who say this game is easier than the first game gave up the first game the first couple hours they played, or because they never stopped using straight sword light attacks. Even the world-record speedrun is indicative of this. Most enemies and bosses give you such a tiny fucking window of attack that the game either keeps you waiting or forces you to take hits if you don't want to wait like an asshole. People don't realize that the first game is superior in almost every aspect because of bum software's delivery of the product, with their pristine Prepare to Crash Edition and the exquisite De-Mastered. I don't want to have to do the fucking Macarena with the dragon every time I go to grab the claymore. I don't know why the bony blue carpet skeleton has to have two thousand fucking hitpoints. Even if the game has good graphics it's invalidated by the fact that every fucking environment, weapon and armor piece has the same grey raggedy shitty ass cum-washed colour palette. Dark Souls 3 is an unpolished shitfest that could be great but refuses because its goal was to appeal to the mainstream as a trendy ninja fortnite dance rage BDSM in my asshole game. If anyone has the retarded urge to tell me to ""get good"" despite me having beat this game and the first multiple times then just know that you are the target braindead dipshit audience for this game.

Once your higher level late game this problem solves its self since you now have better levels and equipment but early game you will constanlty be fighting people who have way better set up then you.

Negative,To add salt to the wound regarding being banned for no reason.2 Days ago i got banned for installing the game after a few monthsBandai Namco support simply told me to delete my beloved character after 30 + hours (no one should ever do that it doesn't matter if its just few hours or 9999+h it breaks the whole experience) i have never cheated in DS3 nor did i used some fancy program to give myself every item or immortality.It only hurts me to see a good game being run by a bunch of incompetent people with their too aggresive anti-cheat Botthat doesn't even protect as from the damn hackers in the first place.As always thank you for coming to my TED talk.,0
Negative,Sekiro is Better,0
Negative,While Dark Souls 3 gameplay looks promising I haven't been able to play the game properly as it is poorly optimised leading to constant microstuttering and crashes. In its current state this game is simply not worth paying for.I would recommend buying this game in the future if it's been patched to run properly.,0
Negative,My cousin died from a dark souls addiction 0/10 but good game tho.,0
Negative,Play Big Rigs: Over the Road Racing instead,0
Negative,just get dark souls 2: scholar of the first sin. it's like this but better :),0
Negative,really badly optimized,0
Negative,Bit of a shit game ill be honest,0
Negative,"This is one of the most overhyped games ever. Does this truth statement hurt you? Good. It feels like playing an old arcade game. You know those old arcade games where they are infested with artificial difficulty just so you keep dying to waste your coins if you want to keep playing. Dark Souls is the same but it wastes your time instead. And coin if you actually made the mistake of buying it. TL;DR at the end.Let me tell you about the reality of this game. It's a one giant troll fest. Just look at all the numerous issues with it:- NO BORDERLESS WINDOW MODE- NO CLOUD SAVES- Extremely bad and outdated combat system. It's a torture to actually use it. And you struggle with it, not the game.- Story is basically non-existent. You don't even have an open world. It's just zones after zones with no goals, no indications why you are killing all these enemies and what the consequences of killing them are. There are no indicators where to go and what to do as well. Your best hope is to remember all the map you have traversed and go to those places you haven't visited yet and hope they let you progress further into the game. After you finish the game you realize if you want all achievements you have to complete it 3 more times.3 more times going through this slog LMAO- Missing tons and tons of content compared to other RPGs, content that would make the game fun to play and actually playable. There are NO spells, NO weapons(basic swords/spears/shields do not count), NO loot(the loot that drops is completely useless as it's just basic swords or basic armor just for the sake of having equipment), Dodge/block/parry do nothing so it's as if they are missing as well. Imagine playing World of warcraft without spells/abilities and just running around with some sword? Yeah, that's what Dark Souls is.- Lots of bugs and glitches that have not been fixed on purpose.- Controls, combat, camera - they are awful on purpose as well, you struggle with the controls and not the game itself. This is an artificial difficulty and not an actual difficulty of the game.- Enemies keep respawning after you die or use the bonfire to heal and save the game. This is the only game that does this just a way for the devs to troll you and think they made a difficult game. It's wasting your time with dealing with random trash mobs and keeping you away from the interesting parts of the game.- Random overpowered enemies in your way that one shot/two shot you to force you into the point above this one. An endless circle jerk where you spend half of the game running around and killing the same trash mobs over and over just to progress the level which often ends up with some random overpowered enemy killing you in one hit, put there clearly by the troll developers.- Random players invade you and one hit kill you, cheaters exist and there is no anti cheat.- Boss fights feel like boss fights but sometimes too much. It's fine for a boss to hit you hard, makes sense. But the game also suffers from the well-known bug every similar game, any third person RPG game, has ever had - the enemy's hit box sliding around especially in circles when you try to get behind the boss. This leads to the boss instantly turning around and hitting you (because it has a lock-on on you) without any animations, looking unnatural when you try to get behind the boss using dodge mechanics. Many other games suffer from this like Kingdoms of Amalur, Dragon age, World of Warcraft. I doubt this will ever be fixed so you cannot do such boss fights like they are presented here, with long attack range and wide area of effect hits. One way I found to counter such behavior in games is dodging into the boss which works 90% of the cases but I am not fond of it because it borderlines with exploiting game mechanics, but hey, if they didn't bother to make the combat properly then it is okay. Bosses must not have lock-on on you is one way to fix this(?)- If you want to play co-op with someone you cannot disable invasions. There will always be some asshole ruining your game or even a hacker that will spawn items and get you banned BEWARE!- Using mods online will get you banned!- Cluttered menus full of pointless options and pop-up menus, AWFUL CONSOLE DESIGN!- Missing basic and essential options from RPG games such as simple stats screen where you can easily compare and swap gear.- There is barely any loot, with 10 hours in I got 3 swords that I cannot equip and clothing gear that is weaker than my starter gear. IN AN RPG GAME THERE IS NO LOOT! (After finishing the game I can say this is pretty much true. I got 2 swords and armor in the middle of the game that I used until I finished the game, making any other weapons and armor loot pointless.)- Every time you die you lose points(souls) that are used for leveling up. And you will die a lot not because the game is hard but because you will fall victim to bugs and bad gameplay design. This means you enter one giant circle jerk where you cannot level up and can't progress at all. Unless you are willing to farm tons of weak trash mobs and run back and forth to exchange your earned points for experience to level up.Of course it would be biased if I don't talk about the good things. Visually it looks decent, the atmosphere is amazing, the world and design of everything is amazing. But you realize that for a game to be good it needs every aspect of it to be good and especially the gameplay which is flawed and I told you why with the truths above.One other good thing that came out of the dark souls series is the ""git gud"" meme which can be amusing in certain situations. This is not one of them. Hence why all comments have to be disabled so the trolls and elitist pricks can't post their manure here(they are pressing the funny button on the review though, and using the Jester reward - proof they are absolutely butthurt, truth hurts them but hey, thank you for the free points!). This game will never be on the level of games like Ninja Gaiden(NES) which is inherently one of the most difficult games ever made, without any bugs it manages to really push your gaming skills and reactions and I have managed to complete those 3 NES games on the old hardware without using modern save states, proving I am indeed on the top of my game.TL;DR - There is no defending the game because all I've written above is absolutely true. When it comes to the score, this gets 1/10. It's a forgettable experience bringing nothing unique to the gaming world except devs who like to troll you and you let them do it while also defending them(to all the trolls and elitist jerks). Pretty sad if you ask me. You could play it but be warned that unless you have A LOT of patience you won't find this game interesting or entertaining. It's a broken mess of a game using outdated engine, outdated graphics and outdated combat system. There are a lot more games that are much more fun to play. But the world and lore are really cool, however, the gameplay lacks and it can be really boring, slow and broken most of the time.If you want to play a good RPG game, do not play any dark souls game. Instead play Dragon Age II or Kingdoms of Amalur. They are light years better than this mess.Here is a list of games I created with the best Fantasy RPG games that are much much better than this mess:https://store.steampowered.com/curator/42021209/",0
Negative,"This game is so close to being good, but just isn't. It has so many issues with it that it's inexcusable. You can have fun with it, there are good parts to it, but it's just overwelmingly covered with issues and bad design that all the fun or accomplishment you would feel just turns to frustration and tedium.I'm not going to bother with the good, it's there and it's nothing new from the last games. Other people have already said the good, I'm going to say the bad and why it's not worth it.1. Camera. It's SO BAD in this game. It just does not work, and you will die SO MANY TIMES because it fucked up. And large enemy causes it to freak out and turn oddly, and it's so zoomed in half the time that you can't see what bosses are even doing. In addition to that a lot of regular enemies freak the camera out if you get to close, and cause it to 180 and this not only is disorienty but causes sudden changes to your controls and will easily get you hit/killed. They also have this stupid system called ""cinematic camera"" on by default that only makes your camera lean forward and lock into place on some attacks. Thankfully you can turn it off.2.Lock-on. It's crap. Not only is it a short as fuck range, but it just randomly unlocks all the time. Oh man, and enemy walked behind another enemy/lamp post better unlock. Oh man, that enemy slightly jumped, better unlock. Oh hey, you're close to this enemy, better unlock. Lock on goes above your head on a large enemy? Unlock. How in the world did they fuck this mechanic up so bad?3.Poise. More then enough has been said about this, it doesn't work past the first point. All that one point does is give you access to your weapons hyper armor (that some have) and nothing else. Litterally that's it, no one has found any proof whatsoever that it does anything more. And all we've gotten from Fromsoftware is ""it's working as intended"" which I'm sure is just like durability was ""working as intended"" in DS2.4.Enemy AI. This is largely a problem because of Poise. Enemies just attack relentlessly, over and over and over without stop, and with barely any (if any in some cases) openings to hit back. Enemies get their own poise because ""fuck you"", or just randomly break out of flinching cause why not and endlessly attack you. It's boring and frustraiting. Several bosses, are just walls because they never stop attacking. Ever. Every little hit stuns you making these enemies more frustraiting than they need to be.5.Boss tells. They're really not there. The game is so fast, that they either don't have tells for most of their attacks or they're so fast and similar that you can't tell before hand. The few tells that are there are for the slowball attacks. This is more a gripe than an issue, but still. You more have to guess than actually know what attack a boss will use a good 70% of the time.6.Armor. You can't upgrade armor in this game, and I really haven't found any armor that's better than stuff you get early on. If anything there's more cosmetic armor than actually decent armor. This would be fine, if even the most common of enemies weren't one shotting me since mid game. I'm not glass cannon either, roughly 1k health with the best armor I can use (without fat rolling) and still bosses easily one shot, and most enemies either do 60% or one shot as well. More often then not it just feels like I'm outstatted rather than killed through a misstake.7.Online. Two covenants don't even work right now, or at least they don't work for older characters. Maybe they do now. But in addition to that there's a glitch where friendly phantoms can't enter boss doors. It's not even a rare glitch, and there are some bosses where it pretty much always happens from what I've heard/experienced.8.Parrying. Doesn't work right, half the time even when you do successfully parry (not a partial block/parry, a full fledged knock them back and go into a reposte parry) you still take damage as if you failed. It's not a rare occurance, and it's terrible. In a game where player poise doesn't exist, and enemies spam attacks the one mechanic you could use doesn't work reliably.9.Shortcuts. All of them, ALL OF THEM, are anything but short. Anytime you die and have to redo a boss, or go back to an area it's an easy 2+min treck back to a boss or an area, and that's if you run past all the enemies.10.Area size. The game is huge. Areas are huge, and can get very convoluted. For anyone who likes to explore everything and do everything, this quickly becomes annoying and tedious. You will miss things, npc, whole areas, etc beacuse you didn't notice a small thing/something was invisible and will inevitably have to backtrack and try to find it or just miss it forever. It's also great that some mandatory things are hidden past tiny little hidden areas, that's great. What doesn't help is the games almost obsesive tendancy to have areas that slow you down. Forcing you to a walk/fat roll way to travel and wasting even more time in those areas.This game is easily the worst of the three dark souls games because of these issues. Even the basic systems that worked flawlessly in the last systems are unreliable in this game (camera, lock on). I just can't recommend this, beacuse of all these issues. The game has lost all fun or fullfillment because it never feels like a challenge is hard for the right reasons. The game feels like it was designed with certain mechanics in place and working, and then had them removed on launch. It's just bad.",0
Negative,"Bought this so me and lilttle brother could play coop together, went to first area and imediately got invaded. We managed to hit him a total of 12 times before he killed us both. He was twinked out and we only got him down 1/2 health. He hit us for 3/4 our health every hit. Wasn't really fun nor fair.No way to coop anymore other than burning our embers. Constantly got invaded by twinked out invaders. One could count to 30 before the next invader came, couldn't even get to first boss. Out of embers have to solo bosses or restart charaters if we wan't to play together. Little brother isn't having fun gonna go play something else.",0
Negative,"I want to enjoy this game, I really do.It doesn't take much to please me, I played both DkS and DkS2:SotFS, and I enjoyed both immensely, so of course I knew more or less what I was walking into when I bought this game.If you are able to play this game, you can expect everything that made the previous Souls games great, the gameplay, the weapon movesets (which are now even cooler with weapon arts), the boss fights, the story, the gorgeous views, the pvp, the pve, the praising of the sun, loveable npcs, the determined skeletons, and the absolutely moving soundtrackBut oh, god, the port for PC is unplayable.I have never had significant issues running games on my computer before, I don't know if it's just my graphics card or if something more is at play here.Even on offline mode and at the absolute lowest of all graphics settings, the framerate lag is not only a nuisance, but a hindrance to my ability to play the game.And not only that, but something happened whereby after eight hours of trying to push through in spite of the lag and accidentally getting one of the greatest NPCs in the game killed as a result, I can no longer even navigate through menu options.I open the game, and neither my mouse nor my controller will allow me to select anything other than the ""Continue"" option. I enter the game world, and when I try to interact with any menu interfaces in-game, it doesn't let me select anything except the default setting. I can't switch my equipment, I can't use any of the items in my inventory, I can't reinforce my uchigatana at the blacksmith, hell, I can't even exit the game.It has gotten to the point where the only way to exit the game is to close it forceibly from the task manager while it's still running.I spent eighty dollars on the deluxe edition because I knew that being able to play the game would be worth it. But I can't even play it. I have 9.3 hours logged at the time of my writing this, most of which has been spent not even playing the game, but trying to make it work. And somehow it has only gotten worse over time.As much as I love the Souls series and as much as I feel I can love this game, I can't recommend it in good conscience unless you have a seriously beefy computer.I wish I could have written a review about the content of the game, because what little I was able to experience before my menus stopped working was great in spite of the horrendous framerate lag.I'm sorry. I can't give this game a positive review until these issues get patched.",0

Negative,"Mahiro Yasaka is just an ordinary high school student, until one day he is suddenly attacked by a dangerous monster. Just when everything seems to be lost, he is saved by a silver-haired girl named Nyaruko, who claims to be the shape-shifting deity Nyarlathotep from horror author H. P. Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos, sent by the Space Defense Agency to Earth. She explains to Mahiro that the creature chasing him was an alien called Nightgaunt, who had planned on abducting and selling him as a slave.After rescuing him from the alien, the Lovecraftian deity falls madly in love with Mahiro and forces herself into his household, much to his chagrin. Moreover, they are soon joined by two others from the fictional universe: Cthuko, a girl obsessed with Nyaruko, and Hasuta, a young boy easily mistaken for a beautiful female. Together, the three eccentric aliens protect Mahiro from the various extraterrestrial dangers that threaten both his and Earth's well-being, all the while making his life a living hell.",0
Negative,"I've played and finished the game with a controller. It was definitely fun since I played it with friends, so it wasn't that hard. But despite the many good reviews I see about this game, I still don't know how it hasn't received proper support to be ported properly. Button prompts are for controllers. And trying to connect certain controllers just make the game behave kinda crazy. Really? Even games by indie developers have better support. Some of these indie games are even successful across multiple platforms without porting issues. I gotta say that alone is a huge disappointment for me, for such a popular game from a bigger developer.Otherwise, still a fun game to play with friends though.",0
Negative,epic game but you increase the price way toooo much on argentina store not worth that muchbtw dark souls remasterd also not worth that price f u bandai namco,0

Negative,"It's just watered down bloodborne. Plus trying to co-op with friends is like pulling teeth, not to mention that in doing so you get invaded by turbo virgins who get off on nothing else than making everyone have a bad time who do twink builds that'll just kill you in like 2 hits, which are near impossible to deal with because of the shitty peer-to-peer system guaranteeing that they're always going to be as laggy as possible.",0

Negative,"Okay,This game is actually beautiful, not as good looking as Mortal Shell, but it is beautiful nonetheless.What killed it for me was the combat mechanics. I like to hack and slash tactically, meaning that I like to block either with shield or sword and occasionally when required dodge and roll, but DK3 feels so different from Mortal Shell, which I absolutely adore playing.A few good pointers this game has: The atmosphere and the grimness of the landscape is absolutely superb. I just wish the combat was more like Mortal Shell. Therefore I refunded the product.",0
Negative,"I never write reveiws. but i had to write a review on this game. Because its so shit, the secon you start a game you will find out it is a consol port, and guess what. in the character creation screen their is no back button, i was trying to creat a character and i couldnt go back ? and it says hit the b button to go back. so i press b on my key board and nothing! you wanna know what key you press ? its not b ? stupid guess because guess what. its the FUCKING Q BUTTON! the game is broken right from the fucking start please dont by this i sooo want my money back fuck you dark souls",0

Negative,"They removed Family Share. So RIP any chances of playing one of the amazing community mods, dicking around offline with the Cheat Engine to make cool looking outfits for cosplay ideas, or just in general if you got banned because some asshat abusing the system forced items into your inventory that you cannot get rid of. GOOD JOB BANDAI YOU FUCKING USELESS CUNTS.",0
Negative,"Completely trial and error. There are almost no hard fights where the game gives you clear cues and expects you to take them on. All difficulty in this game will come from the obscurity of information, and once you have all the information you will breeze through it. This creates the illusion of being a hard game or getting gud, when in reality you're just going through a long spanking machine and at the end of the spanking the game says you won.90% of enemies are hiding, the remaining 10% violate expectations to damage you by surprise in some other way (Cant be staggered, weird fast attack after a slow attack, enemies programmed to stand around until you take an action then charge attack you, etc). Side quests are all ridiculously hidden. Maybe 5/12 areas of the game depending on how you count are hidden, usually in ridiculous ways. Item descriptions and game mechanic descriptions are woefully lacking. Leveling up is a long series of soft caps, sudden boosts, then more softcaps, and then discovering a new weapon that's vastly more useful than the old one you built around anyway. The entire game is just about using the wiki and already having gone through it once.It's absolutely not your typical skill based game about practicing and applying general abilities. It's more like the Impossible Quiz. You are completely beholden to knowing a lot of really small things, and you will be told you died until you hit the next checkpoint and everything you learnt is now useless until NG+.",0
Negative,This game is in no way ready for PC. You have to go through a good half an hour of finding out what the tutorial means. I heard this game was good through friends but it just falls flat with integration into PC. would not recommend.,0
Negative,"I tried, game kept freezing. Can't recommend.",0
Negative,"No Steam Cloud Saves. 134 hours down the drain. Great game! But as soon as I saw no option for a new game plus, I decided to go on and try another game equally as hard as Dark Souls 3.",0

Negative,"I have been working with computers for 30 years, about 20 of them doing software engineering. Never in my life I have seen a program which does not know how to use keyboard properly.Until I launched Dark Souls III for the first time. My character just would not stop. I do not own a controller, nor do I intend to. All I can say is that however released this game on PC - has staggering incompetence.",0
Negative,"This game can be summarised as not fun at all.Not only is the game no help at all with the controls, with the control prompts being given for controller buttons instead of the keyboard/mouse bindings which were in use at the time, with no controller plugged in, the controls felt sluggish. Add to that the fact that all the enemies seem to respawn when you die (ok, I can understand that, I'm familiar with checkpoints etc), but also when you rest at a fire. Those things just add up to a game that is simply not fun. I'm sure some people will enjoy this type of game, I simply did not.",0
Negative,"Once again i find myself back to this game, and once again I'm left disappointed. Beat it in 15 hours because of my experience on other platforms, ended up basically killing Dancer right after Vordt and steamrolling the game, which doesn't actually make it any more fun than it was my first time through. What DS1 and DS2 got right, DS3 got miserably wrong trying to copy the success of Bloodborne, the recent release at the time. My worst gripe with this game is straight up just how little creativity there is in the buildcrafting, in PVE yes, but especially in PVP. There's just no reason to use anything but Dex, Strength gives you the lovely illusion of choice with the dragonslayer greataxe, but look past that and you'll realise that other than this and like two other heavy weapons you have to slog through the worst DLC ever released to get, there's no more options. UGSes suck, unlike in DS2 and DS1 where they actually felt like massive hunks of metal and hit like them too. But once you realise you can ALSO hit 500 per hit with twinblades, there's almost no point in using anything else. I frames by default are too forgiving to even land a hit with a UGS 3/4 of the time you're using one, especially if you're going against a dex user who stacked their stamina bar.Bosses are either a complete pushover or nigh impossible, not because of movesets, or damage, or anything like that, simply because of their mammoth sized and (sometimes) triple phased healthbars. Sister Friede isn't difficult by design, she's difficult because you have to fight her 3 times in a row with 15 estus (another mistake DS2 fixed with lifegems that they brought back again.) genuinely, base game is literally a cakewalk, the only difficult fights in the game are nameless king or maybe SoC if you cant parry for shit. The DLC bosses however are some of the most poorly designed boss fights in gaming. (Demon prince, Midir, looking at both of you.) Fromsoftware decided to make a souls game that's geared towards people who THINK souls games are about constantly dodgespamming and being ganked and two shot. It's almost like i should be writing a review for the DLC because they're the biggest crock of feces in this game overall. I get that moon grass and lifegems were removed because estus in 2 was basically a last ditch and demons souls' early game is nigh impossible unless you dupe moon grass, but 15 estus to last for a 10 ish minute fight with bosses that two shot you is ridiculous. DS2 and DS1 had fun linearity and this game ditched that for a bloodborne ordeal of one basic straight line to the finish, unless you count skipping dancer (something youre basically not meant to do) or doing smouldering lake. This game is more bloodborne 2 than it was Dark Souls 3, and you can tell because Irithyll was clearly meant to be something akin to Yharnam. After years of whitewash, especially with this series as a whole being hailed as untouchable masterpieces, it's so clear that Dark Souls 3 is probably the weakest entry we've gotten in the Soulsbornekiroring line, somehow Demon's Souls, a tech demo from 2009, had more interesting areas than this game did. everywhere looks like a replica of the last place, especially from undead settlement to the end of Carthus, which is basically the first quarter of the game. Lothric Castle is also just ANOTHER rehash of Boletarian Palace/Drangleic Castle/Dukes Archives, which is a staple in these games at this point. Play DS2 instead. Genuinely. This game lasts like 15 hours if you're well versed in playing it. I was at archdragon peak by 4am this morning and i'd started at 7 the night before. At least with my replays of 2 or even 1 i can squeeze thirty hours out of those, this is a short short game with mediocre or artificial as fuck difficulty all throughout. Homeward bone yourself to the refund page and get SOTFS instead.",0
Negative,"I tried it and I couldent get past the first level after an hour, so i refunded it becuause i doubt i was able to get past the first boss . i dont recomend unles you like spending 2 hours on a single boss fight, with a total of 20 atempts. the story looks awesome but i cant access it because of the insanly high beginner dificulty.",0

I can't attest to the end-game content because I haven't gotten there yet on any of the 5 different characters I've had to make.And the best part is, after all these corrupt files get detected on the server-side, you'll get a soft ban restricting your online activity!

Negative,"The game is great, but I cannot in good will support this company when they unjustifiable and permanently softban people. My best friend, that I know for 11 years, simply picked up an item from a hacker and he got permanently banned from playing online. This has been the case a year now. He wrote to DS support about it 3 times over the course of the year and it still hasn't been resolved (they haven't even replied).",0
Negative,"TL;DR: If you have a life outside of playing video games, move on. The port to PC is terrible on top of what I consider crap gameplay. ***I write this review as someone who is replaying Witcher 3 on Death March for fun***I do not understand what all of the hype is about this title. Honestly, if you want to spend your gaming time dying, then repeating the same fights over and over and over and over so much so that you have it memorized so you finally don't die again, this is the game for you. For me, it is not. I like plenty of games that are difficult. This is not that. No matter how avid a gamer you are, you are 0% prepared to do well. With most games there is a learning curve that typically takes 1-4 hours to get ~90%, then throw in new enemies to keep it fresh et cetera. Dark Souls is a game where there is no end to the learning curve because each section has a sequence of events that outright own you the first time. Not fun. Killing me as a player because I am unskilled is justifiable. Dark Souls kills you simply because you don't know the future. Repeating the same garbage fights over and over is underwhelming.As far as I got, I saw no plot. That is grievously moronic given that the subject matter would lend itself to some decent writing. Plot is also like the glue that hold a game together. Getting axed 1000 times before I beat the game would feel less arbitrary if I had some story or reason to continue. Dying doesn't feel heroic it feels asinine. Ooops I didn't pre-know the thing that is impossible to discern due to no foreshadowing.epic.epicly lame.What made matters worse is the port to PC is a dumpster fire. I have never seen a tutorial as poorly ported by major title as Dark Souls is. They are literally giving you tutorial tips as if you are playing X-box anyway. No new default key information. So I had to sit there and learn the controls from the settings screen for about 15-20 minutes on my own. Then they didn't really get the camera right, as it likes to do what it wants and constantly gives crappy perspectives. I felt as if I had little to no depth perception with auto lock. Which auto lock was lack luster as well, it breaks off too easily and doesn't allow ranged targeting to maximum cast/arrow distance. There is no reticle with spells, not even a dot and they tend to go anywhere but where you think they ought to be going.I could keep going, but here is the basic line. Don't believe the hype and save yourself the grief that is Dark Souls 3. If you are a no-life gamer who wants to get leet gamer cred for beating this trash heap, that's fine. Just don't pretend it is good, because it most certainly is not. It also isn't ""difficult"" either, it is punishing simply to be punishing. Difficult does not equal sadistically repeating levels ad nauseam only because through dying can you properly know what to do for every. single. fight. ***Edit for Commentary***I wrote this review so that non-fanboys would understand what they were getting and to avoid it if they didn t want it. Everything in the review is factual. This includes the obvious toxic fanbase that is punctuated by leaving such child like comments. While I have initially deleted them if they were non constructive, I have decided to let all remain after this edit. It will serve as a showcase of how toxic the community really is. I will also stop reading the comments, so don t expect me to respond. If you are somehow triggered enough by this review to want to leave incendiary comments you need to reevaluate your life. Being a Dark Souls player is not a personality trait. You are acting like you're in a cult and I insulted your cult leader. This game is an objectively bad port with objectively bad gameplay. Stop making excuses for this garbage because somehow Dark Souls is part of your identity. Grow a pair and evaluate it objectively. If you think for one second that if a PC game ported to X-box/PS and it didn t have new default controls set up properly, or have a camera that worked right with your controller instead of mouse people wouldn t complain you are utterly hopeless. Should I say to them, well go buy a keyboard and mouse for your console, don t blame the company selling an incompatible port for taking your money?Furthermore, who needs to get gud is Bandi/Namco. Their game sucks and so do their port skills. Not to mention their banning skills from what I ve read from other reviews. Witcher 3 is 10x more epic, deep, ENJOYABLE and gorgeous than Dark Souls III ever will be, while still being challenging. And guess what? CD Projekt Red is going to release Cyber Punk 2077 that will also completely obliterate Dark Souls III, and even the next one. When I hold Dark Souls III up to nearly any other RPG for that matter, it loses. It loses because it is boringly repetitive, not because it is too difficult. Just because you suffered through playing something doesn t make it or you gud. It only indicates that you are willing to put up with bullshit for bullshit s sake. That is not something to be proud of. It is something Frat houses do to haze pledges.",0

Negative,"SO! Having managed to trudge through this game and actually beat the fucking thing, I can rightfully review it!Not worth the buy. If it's free? Maybe. Compared to previous Souls games, this one has a habit of. removing things. Armor is barely effective and is basically just fashion, most existing shields have had their defense values significantly reduced, and the amount of bosses that can be parried or back-stabbed has been reduced rather greatly. Other issues are stuff like: Enemies getting staggered from being hit but eventually choosing to IGNORE said stagger in favor of hitting you mid-combo. Enemies who simply don't follow the same rules as you (Infinite spells, not bouncing off walls, etc). Overall, while the game looks fucking amazing, has great atmosphere, and really fucking cool bosses, the feeling of ""What gimmick will be coming around the next corner!"" really kills it for me. Every time I started getting into it I'd run into an enemy that specifically punishes you for taking more than a single shot against them before dodging again.Recommendation: Watch someone else play it, it looks better than it plays.",0

Negative,"Terrible on PC.-All the menus still have controller buttons instead of keyboard LOL WHAT ARE YOU F***ING KIDDING ME LMFAOI ALMOST DEMANDED A REFUND THIS HAS GOT TO BE A JOKE. -Camera so static you can't keep it from going up your ass when you're not fighting.-Camera moving around during fights during awkward random times even tho you are just clicking mouse 1 and not moving the mouse at all-game doesnt tell you if you're in multiplayer or not, doesn't give you any information whatsoever about anything except some lucky coins that legit do nothing.-accidentally somehow took away my weapon and shield by scrolling mousewheel up however they appear to be ""equipped"" in inventory and unequipping and re equipping does nothing, furthermore scrolling the mouse wheel again also does not remedy and you are now weaponless and not wearing your shield.

Nope, tough luck here, everything one-shots you. Got used to fairly stupid AI? Not here, here you can get surrounded and mauled by three rats. Three. Little. Rats. Did you want to have some ember? Sorry mate, you're gonna use all of them to unlock maybe one more bonfire and one more boss fight before smashing your gamepad/keyboard and mouse/whatever you play with. I wanna spare you this suffering, so I am telling you in advance: If you like the lore, go watch some YouTube videos about it. If you like the level design, go watch a walkthrough and save your time for some better game that won't mentally break you.tl;drtbh game is okay, but out-of-nowhere difficulty raise after first lord of cinder grabs you by the balls and destroys your expectations about the game, so don't even bother playing it.",0

I would give it a mixed rating, but there isn't, so just a down vote.",0
Negative,"If you haven't played a Souls game before, DS3 is fine. If you have, it's a tired and uninteresting entry in a series that's out of ideas and should be allowed to rest. Get ready to dodge roll for the millionth time.",0
Negative,"Another departure from the previous games. Much faster paced combat and even more crafting potential.The bad? A very linear world. A very samey-world with a lot of copycat greyscale themes copied from Bloodborne, a PS4 exclusive made by the same company a year prior. Gankfest ambush spawns and high density of enemies harkening back to Scholar of the First Sin and Demon's Souls which are meant to pad your time in between boss runbacks. Many gimmicky bosses also harkening back to Demon's Souls, where you are meant to solve the boss then attack it appropriately until it dies. It takes every aspect of Dark Souls II and amps it up to 11 in all of the worst ways, coated in the guise of a decent-looking game. This is not an adventure series with action and RPG elements laid on top anymore, but an action RPG with explorative aspects and level-ups.",0
Negative,"Meh. I give it a 6/10I feel like I gave the game a fair shot, mostly because the franchise has a cult following, and I wanted to see what the fuss was about. Partly because I had a very vocal friend who adored it. And partly because it was on sale.I like the game's commitment to difficulty. Gaming has changed in my lifetime, and there are laudable things about being inclusive in game design. But it does mean that some players find that almost every game feels too easy. It's frustrating, and I worry about spending my budget on a game (particularly a mobile game) because any of them might be a cakewalk.Combat in the DS franchise is highly skill oriented. Skill here refers to the kind that comes from memorization through repetition, like playing violin or kicking a football. And just like any skill of that kind, whether or not you'll get bored has to do with whether you can enjoy the practice enough to develop the reflexes, and whether you feel like you've wasted your time once you have. I couldn't get into it. I tried. I wanted to like it. But eventually I realized that I was playing the game for somebody else. I'm not sure who. Maybe my friend who said it was one of the ""best games ever created"". But when I was honest about it, it felt like I was a kid practicing something my parents wanted me to do. I was bored, and hammering out the game like it would prove something. But my mind wandered, and I just could not make myself care what has happening in the game. I always ended a session feeling like I needed to do something fun to offset it. Like I'd done a chore and deserved a reward. That's the precise opposite of what I want from a game.The only part of the game I want to call objectively bad is the appallingly crappy multiplayer. I thought I could put up with the game if I could at least play with a friend. But the co-op system is a feeble afterthought, and you are disconnected any time one of you dies. Which is very often. It's hard to imagine anybody letting that feature through QA without a resignation following. And the pvp invasion mechanic is a confusing and incongruous personal ego-stroking mechanism. I wondered who it was for, until I remembered some of the personalities from the DS community. Then I took the game offline.Summary and ConclusionsYou might enjoy the game if you're cool with playing solo, practicing until you know the game by rote, and can derive satisfaction from knowing that you're individually good at a game that is notorious for difficulty. Or something. If you're of the more toxic variety of player, and can learn to say ""git gud"" like a well-trained parrot, you'll fit in with the subculture. YMMV, so give it the 2-hour trial shot if you're curious. But also remember that this game wasn't designed to be even dented in two hours.-Edit: Like most of my reviews, this one's too long and I've been slowly paring down the fat by removing redundancy.",0
Negative,"This is easily the worst game in the Souls series by far. Instead of taking the good parts of DS2 and improving upon them, it completely abandons all of them and tries to be Bloodborne 2 when it comes to gameplay, but fails horribly at it. There are too many things gone wrong with the game to name them all, I'm just going to name those things that I hated the most:1. Armor is completely useless and offers barely any protection, you can no longer upgrade it as well. This results in everyone running around in rags and pretty much treating VIT as a dump stat.2. The overwhelming majority of weapons in the game scale exceptionally well with a ""quality"" built character, which eliminates any build variety in both pvp and pve. If you don't have 40STR+40DEX, you're playing the game wrong.3. Instachugging, it's absolutely horrendous.4. Rollspam is pretty much a necessity to beat most bosses, shields are a joke and aren't worth their weight and the needed VIT investment to use them.5. Absolutely linear world deisgn, the absolute worst in the series. It is mind-boggling how bad it is compared to DS2 world.6. Absolutely horrible pvp due to lack of build variety since any sort of magic is completely non-viable and everyone uses a ""quality"" build. Punishing chuggers is near-impossible and invasions are utterly horrible with everyone running around with 2 gold phantoms even before you actually enter their world.7. Complete lack of any sort of incentive to play through NG+ and onward, this is a massive step back compared to DS2, which added new enemies and phantoms as well as added new enemies to boss fights. The only things that change in DS3 on NG+ and onward is the addition of +1/2/3 ring variants, which exist mostly to artificially inflate your playtime if you want to get all of the achievements.8. Complete lack of any sort of interesting phantom invasions. Massive step back compared to DS2.I could continue listing the things I hate about the game, but, personally, this is already enough for me to name DS3 the absolute weakest game in the series and a total letdown.",0
Negative,"They want 60 dollars for a game that came out in 2016. Don't get me wrong, dark souls 3 is a great game, but I feel like after a certain number of years the price for games should go down a bit so people who are patient can eventually afford it.",0

Negative,"I am a hardcore souls fan and have played every souls game up to this. The world looks beutifull and vibrant. And the changes made to the game make it feel alot like Demon Souls, the first ever souls game. Having said that though, the game as a hardcore fan of the series is quite easy compared to the others. Having recently replayed Dark Souls 2 SotFS; im realy breezing through it withouth any armor(fast rolling) and the starter axe.Most of the time when franchises get more and more populair their quality and difficulty decreases because they want to apeal to a wider audiance, and I feel like this might be the last in the series that stays sort off true to the difficulty off the actual series, even if it is the easiest one. And I realy hope im wrong.For hardcore fans, you might be a bit disapointed with the difficulty, but other that, its another Souls game, nothing majorly different.For newcommers, eventhough I'd rather say start with the first in the franchise, especialy if you want to get into the story. It is the best one to start with when it comes to the difficulty. IF you are like me though, and you're sick of easy handholding every sucker can do it non-satisfying gameplay than buy Dark Souls 2 Scholar of the First Sin instead. It is argueably the hardest, but therefore 10x more satisfying than this. as for the major bugs and crashes, set lighting to low, and you'll barely have any crashes.And personaly because it is easy, I wouldn't realy recommend this one in the series.",0

Negative,"I bought this a long time ago on sale in a bundle with Dark Souls 2, not knowing these were originally console games. I played Dark Souls 2 for awhile, until the grind just got too ridiculous. Dark Souls 3 has not shown that it will be anything different. The game does not transition well to keyboard/mouse controls and the instructions they give even still list the controller buttons to push, instead of keys. The camera controls and views make the game even more difficult. DS2 started with some kind of story/beginning. DS3 just throws you right into the mix with a few mobs and then a boss fight that does not feel like it belongs at the beginning of a game. I am sure that just like in DS2, I could look up a pattern that would enable me to beat this boss, but I don't really want to just memorize patterns to beat mobs/bosses. This is a large part of what turned me off of DS2. If this is what you are looking for in a game, you may like DS3, but I would recommend using a controller and not a keyboard/mouse.",0

It's a bootleg Elden Ring, extremely restrictive and also much easier.",0
Negative,"Dark Souls 3 is good if you intend to make one character and just get to the end with a very powerful computer, not caring about quests, PvP, or item collection.If you want to complete quests, you need to outright cheat using the wiki, because several questlines have completely unknowable triggers to end them, and completing quests is mandatory for some of the best items in the game.If you want to play PvP, you'd better not be a fan of large weapons, because Poise is an almost completely superficial stat now. Every single hit guarantees a second follow-up, parrying is easier than ever with the .5 weight Ceastus, and the penalty for being parried ever is instant death, courtesy of a particular element-infused dagger and a ring which boosts ""critical"" hits. Though if you're willing to risk it, you can always spam R1 with a scythe, which seems to get 4 free hits instead of 2.If you intend to make multiple characters, you'd better be prepared to retrieve every single item in the game over again, as there is no communal weapon system. Granted, people artificially use high-level items at low levels for an unfair advantage, but that only means that an internal system which allows sharing between characters, but forces weapons to scale would be even better for the series.The PvE is still solid Dark Souls, complete with cryptic lore and grim chuckles, so the only barrier to that now that Remastered will siphon away invaders will be the terrible optimization. As I said before, you need an incredible computer to play this game adequately, and even then, it has occasional crashing.Even before it was outdated, Dark Souls 3 is only worth getting on sale.",0

WTF IS WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE.###########################################################################NOTE# The Game is Paced in away that makes very little content take forever to go threw and if I find the content lacking this is getting an immediate down vote again.3 hrs in and im pretty sure the game is grind2win.Game feels clunky on a GTX1050 TI with 8gb Ram and i5 6500 also feels like their is input lag.From what I understand so far the gameplay is barebones and there is no difficulty there is only a grind. I will still play threw it I got it on Humble Bundle but I doubt much will change.4 hrs in and im pretty sure dodging is the main mechanic in the game.So far the story looks very appealing but immersion is broken by the fact there are so many bonefire with coiled swords in them you just teleport too. Game mechanics at 60 fps still feel very clunky the camera also does not feel smooth and there is plenty of input lag.Items are placed around were you must find a path to aquire that is usually out of place for anything else. The world looks nice.7 hrs in the combat feels barebones. The world still looks nice. The NPC's Enemy Neutral and Allied look and sound very good. The Story is intresting and doesnt seem to break itself.Combat consists of Mostly Dodgeing somtimes hitting rare blocking and I have never found a reason so far to heavy attack, Items are used to convience. Plenty of dead ends and maze style maps.10 hrs in I can tell its a pretty decent game. Its more a puzzle memory game then it is a fighting game. It has a very good atmosphere and story. NPC's are done very well too. Voice acting is also good. Controller Button prompts should not appear tho since Im using a keyboard and mouse.Input lag while it seems to be a feature should be refined in a later installment and removed. Often I found my self doing an action I did not intend because of input lag.##################################FINAL NOTICE: THE GAME IS OK AND ALLOT OF FUN.

Negative,This game sucks its too hard,0
Negative,"Dark souls 1 is my favorite game of all time, and dark souls 2 was a disapointing mess. This sequel is no better to be honest. My main gripes about the game could have been easily avoided in the development process.Let's start shall we? No mother fucking poise. If you are a seasoned dark souls veteran you know the importance of thsis stat, it's a giant part of armor selection and pvp in general. So why take it out? Why change the combat system so drasticaly that I can barley even recognize it as the souls game it is? It may look like the same combat system as dark souls 1 from an outside perspective but if you actually PLAY the game it feels like a completley different game, becuase it is. Spells now rely on a mar instead of limited casts now, which encourages spam and cheap pelting spells vs well timed punishes, there is no such thing a rolling catagories now, its all 1 speed (witht the exception of fat rolling of course). Certain weapons are now downrite worse than others instead of the rule of dark souls 1 : if the weapon does not clearly suck then it is more than capable of carrying you trhpugh the game. Straight swords arebasically the new curved swords and curved swords are now mostly extict. I've NEVER seen a spear used except for the partizan one time but that was only becuase he was doing a cosplay, greatswords/great clubs now 2-3 shot literally ANYONE even in full armor, magic is dead except for like, 10 spells that you just spam and hope to hit with. Fucking forget about using axes since they are statistically worse straight swords. Maces suck dick and whips are downright useless. Anything else i missed are not even worth speaking about. PVP is a go damn mess, there are 3-4 PVP builds that can actually work in invasions and if the host and his fucking army of phantoms are using any of the 3 you're dead as dicks anyway. Ganking is literaly free souls ( for some reason invasions give basically no souls now as well so say goodbyw to that) and invasions in general are just cheese fests with the ocasion brave soul/newbie who doesn't use a op build. The weapon you get from one of the most bullshit bosses in the game (he's insanley hard but for a shitload of bad reasons) is downrite op. *sigh* This whole game in general is just a massive disapointment. They can't even fix then poise issue either. If they did PVP would break. Certain actions have really weird queueing problems. Blocking for one. You block a big hit from a boss and tried to roll before getting hit? Well good for you becuase right after the block stun ends you'll roll aand get butt fucked by whatever the bosses follow up is. Also every fucking boss in this game has ridiculous combos and chain stuns that simoultaniously make me want to puke and cry. Some bosses have weird rng attacks that if they pop up, will detroy you for no reason. If wolnir decides to vomit mist at you after yuo got close and hit him you're guarnanted at least haf your health. If Consumed King decides he want to do his no wind up random charge attack in the middle of a swing then you're fucing dead. Some bosses are a god damn pinwheel level joke while others are insanely hard for no good reason. Some bosses can fart and half your summons die and you get nuked for 900 damage while others can smash you with a 4 hit combo and you don't even hav to heal. There are enemies that do an abslute fuck load of damage even if you come back at the end of the game with a levl 95 full armor PVE character.Oh yeah, did i mention armor does jack shit this go round? It's better to just go fashion souls from level 15 up than to wear actually ""good armor"" . Don't bother leveling carry weight since as long as you're under 70 you don't fat roll and as i menioned there is no light roll worth mentioning. Dont bother trying to learn parrying becuase it's useless in pve except vs the first boss and (minor spoiler) his second hidden fight later. Backstabs are sill op in pve and in 127 hours i've seen 2 in pvp, both lagstabs in a gank. Charge attacks from Bloodborne are here and boy a oh fucking boy are they op. All in all the only good things are: the music is neat and the story is alright (although there's still an absoulte SHOTLOAD they still need to explain .The one and only amazing thig about his game gestures. There are 33 and it's a totall joy to help an npc and get one in return. BUT! t]The PVP is a mess the PVE is often annoying and only slightly more intersting than DS2. It's not a terrible game, it's ok at it's core, but if you enjoyed DS1 as much as i did, there is only disapointment and shame ahead friend. Yet if you are a true Dark Souls fan, nothing i say can deter you. So go ahead, add this to your collection, and weep when you do.

Negative,"Great game, terrible port, as always.Every souls game to date has had major issues on PC, and they've shown time and time again just how little they care about this platform.This is the last FromSoftware/Bandai Namco game I'll buy; though I'm sure they don't care, they already have my money.",0
Negative,"I want to love this game. I really do.WHY WONT U LET ME LOVE YOUI know my computer is not of the best performance, therefore I've checked the minimum system requirements for this game a dozen times. My computer passed the minimum and then some, but it was too good to be true.For the game's current state, these are definitely not the minimum system requirements.So on top of the very long loading screens, me being on the lowest graphics possible and the lowest resolution still kicks me out of online sessions due to very low framerate.I wish I could even play on offline mode but the framerate is unbareable. Not to mention the screen flickering, the freezes and the various crashes.I want this to change, so that I could write a good review like this game deserves.Please fix the performance issues.",0
Negative,Meh. Not my cup of tea. Got it for $12 from HumbleBundle monthly.,0
Negative,"The Souls games are pretty awesome, and this one is by no means bad, but it's just not as interesting. The story is much more straightforward, and without that mystery it isn't really all that good. I'm way above minimum specs, but after about 30 minutes of playing the framerate drops to unplayable levels, and every time this happens I get booted offline and have to relaunch the game to reconnect. Changing settings does absolutely nothing, I can't even see a difference. If it weren't for these technical issues I would at least finish the game, boring though it may be, but as it is I can't see myself finishing this one.",0
Negative,"Worst pc port and optimized game ever. Even though they are so called AAA game , they are worst then indie devs and heres why:- A game that needs controller does not support ps4 controller.- Displays funny xbox icons when you are actually using keyboard and mouse.- Can hardly perform all the moves using K/M.- Poorly optimized, even though it looks like 2 year old games, lmao Lords of the fallen runs and looks better.- Constant crashes.- Cannot connect to server problem.- Fanbois are blind and most likely disagree with anyone critisizing the game.Bloodborne is way better cause it looks way better and the wepons are awesome. DS3 is more like Dark Souls 2.5",0
Negative,"I have played all three DS games and this out of the trilogy was by far the worst in terms of PvP, Invasions, and PvE.PvP - Is unbalanced and extremely dull with the only factor being how well you can press R1 and the Occasional Weapon Art.PvE - Slow and Repetive, at least when you ng+ in others games they added new and different enemies. In this they just scaled the health up. Sick Gameplay.Invasions - 100% awful with no real substance, there has been countless youtubers run away from DS because how terrible the invasion system was.Only pro in my eyes is the Tech.Tech - Nicer looking, better systems in term of soul lvl and not as bad as the soul memory from ds2.All in All the game is bad. 4/10 - Play for memes.",0

Negative,"I went back and played throught Dark souls 1 and 2. After that i came back and played throught this one. This game compared to its pretesesors is pretty bad. it is also much much more linear compared to Dark Souls 1 and 2, and Demon Souls. Bloodborne is just like Dark Souls 3 that it too is very Linear. The lore in this title creates more plot holes than it does fill them, expesially with the Ashes of Aredial DLC. There are things that this game needs to adress; example 1 the UI interface. The first two games it was perfect in this one they took a step backwards, i wont go into detail on this one because i have other thoughts that need to be adresses. I'm breaking this up into 2 smaller sections after this sentece is finished. This game relies too much on nostaliga. It makes refrences to Demon Souls and Dark Souls 1 and 2. especially Dark souls 1. They recycled most of Anor Londo, and the Fire Link Shrine. They reused gimiky boss fights againts a gaint (Yorm), Dragons breathiong fire off of brigdes, and the most overatted chatacters of all, Sif, Artorious, and Solair, there all recycled, Solair- his armor set is in the game and people do endless cosplay, Sif- AOA (Ashes of Arendiel) DLC is a poor boss fight, and Artorious his Armor and wepon is in the game, and in the AOA dlc after the Sif RIP OFF boss fight, there is a grave stone that resebles Artorious's graveston ein Dark Souls 1. I can't forget the lady in black refrence in the Unteded Graves (she has the fire keeper eyes). In the AOA DLC the Millwood knight refrences the Abyss Dragon AKA Kalameet. If you have played the Old Hunters for Bloodborne you would know Lady Maria, now look at the AOA final boss it it a very similair boss: both female, similair moveset, 3 differnt phases with their own very uniquefatures to their own fight. The PVP is just thrash in this game ( I BELIVE THAT FROM DOES NOT EVEN PLAY THERE OWN GAME, THEY TOOK THE VALVE APPROACH TO MAINTAIN THERE GAME(S), sorry valve i didn't meen to throw you under the bus). Dak souls 1 had a srtong pvp system with a variety of weapons with various weapons to choose from, any build either serious or silly was vaible. Dark Souls 2 any build you wanted you could make and use, it also had the most diversity among weapons, and power stancing (yes please bring this back please) and dual headed weapons ( those were a blst to use). Dark Souls 3, either Strength, Dex, Luck, Quality, Troll builds, Faith/Intelegence builds ( this includes miracles, Prymancies, Dark Pyromancies, and sorceries). The weapons to choose from are also very limited ( the meta weapons) and majority of the other weapons go unused or untouched. Those are the only builds and weapons at that are available at the moment. This is a hughe downgade. WHY FROM SOFT WHY. It just gets very boring after some time. . . fighting the same builds over and over again.This was supposed to be the final game in the series ( personally i don't belive that this is the final game), but they let the community down. This game was/is a triple A gmae and some people just feel let down on this. i hope you spend more than a year on these things, please don't turn into a yearly COD release for your fans. releasing half finished games it will not be a happy ending.

Negative,"I get that it s a beloved game prized for it's difficulty, but there's difficulty and then there's bad game design that a lot of people mistake for proper difficulty.For example: Enemies having a lot of health, doing a lot of damage, and being difficult to dodge.

Negative,Probably some of the worst enemy design decisions of all time,0
Negative,"The gameplay is fine but the fact that you don't have anything to play co-ops with no invades ""Without a chance of getting banned if you use the mod"" is kinda lame for such a great game, I wish they would take the time to just change that one thing about it.",0

Negative,"I think it takes a certain kind of gamer to like this game. I think the game may be a great game and perhaps I am just not the kind of gamer that can enjoy such as this.It's possible.Anyways from my perspective the game is very difficult to control. Perhaps it was easier on a console but on my mouse and keyboard, being unable to get passed the tutorial after hours of play over a couple of days means I am not on this game's level.I'm not even going to ask for a refund. I'm just going to suck it up and say to Steam and the devs of the game.good job.you got me.I'm not this leet.",0
Negative,"The co-op experience is simply bad due to various connection issues. You have to unwillingly deal with other hardcore players which can be frustrating even without the lag issue that is messing up the battle experience. This is 2019 and the grapics quality just doesn't deserve a thumb up any more. And it seems that the producer is not even trying. There is no instructions for keyboard and mouse players. Plainly remembering every single enemy's position and attacking pattern is not fun, instead it is mind numbing. You don't make good games by making it hard in such a straight way. The player is provided a very limited pool of options with a very repeative battling mode. The actions of all the skills and moves are slow with a mediocre performance. I am so surprised that the producer can get such good reviews by making a million players die a billion times with these simple game designs. The reward system is also chaotic and broken. No element in this game is fun enough to keep a player exploring the world all by oneself to obtain all the good/crucial upgrades. The plot is also not significant and the cut scenes are just not interesting enough for me to watch through. Overall this game isn't as good as its fame.",0
Negative,"Foreword: There will be marked spoilers ahead.This game is terrible.I was hoping that after five games, we would be receiving an omnipotent super-game that would easily blow every Souls game before it out of the water with the amalgamation of all of them melded into one perfectly constructed gift from the heavens. What we received was a scrunched up ball of blatant, shameless pandering to the fanbase coupled with the cheapest enemies that the franchise has ever seen, bosses that have zero creativity, a recycling of its own areas and basic enemies that are capable of annihilating you even if you re overprepared thanks to their zero wind-up attacks, unlimited stamina and absurdly high damage.I'm going to quickly cover the very few good points that this game has before I tear it apart. To begin with, the Focus Points system, mechanically identical to an MP bar which hasn't been used in the series since Demon s Souls, is no longer completely useless for melee characters thanks to the new Skills system. These Skills consume your FP to use some kind of special ability. As an example, the Club gets one that grants it a damage boost and the Longsword gets a sideways slash that bats away shields. Focus Points can also be replenished using the Ashen Estus Flask which upgrades alongside your regular Estus Flask and you may divide the maximum charges between them at the blacksmith. It s a clever mechanic that allows melee-only characters to take advantage of their formerly useless MP bar.NPC questlines are worth seeing at least once, in my opinion. A handful of them will even move around the game world instead of all just ending up in one spot without some kind of conclusion to their own personal journeys, a common complaint about Dark Souls 2.Lastly, after four whole games, they finally implemented a way to hand over multiple covenant items at once. Hallelujah. You can also now swap your devotion between each covenant through your inventory.Unfortunately, that s about it for the good stuff. It s actually quite an outstanding game in the first few hours, but it begins to fall apart very early, at Road of Sacrifices.As soon as you enter this area, you are greeted by a large swamp littered with enemies and some areas of this swamp slow you to a crawl. This is nothing we re not used to, but this doesn't mean it was a good idea in the previous games, either.Even knowing that traversing the swamp is much faster if I equip a weapon that has the Quickstep skill and use that to speed through the parts of the swamp that I'm otherwise forced to slowly walk or fat roll through, this doesn't change the fact that there are enemies everywhere that can all move at normal speed, so the end result is a desperate slow walk to dry land so you can hope to kill the horde that will have followed you. Also, if you re playing online, you'll have the Watchdogs of Farron player invaders akin to the Forest Hunters in Dark Souls to worry about, as well.Once you re past all of that for the first time, you get to do it again in Farron Keep. The swamp slowing your movement speed was tolerable, but the fun drops way down into the negative numbers when the swamp is about three times larger, poisonous, you re forced to locate three shrines and extinguish the fires on each of them and the new enemies here get a weapon that launches about twelve homing projectiles at you. This is about the point where I started eating my controller, the taste of which wasn t improved when I found out that there was no Rusted Iron Ring.This was not made any better after I hit Irithyll Dungeon, at which point I was introduced to the worst enemy in Souls and possibly video game history: the Jailer. This enemy has the ability to drain your maximum health all the way down to 1HP if you re standing near him and he has a soldering iron that he will instantly poke you with to ruin your movement speed thanks to a debuff, then quickly perform a grab attack that WILL strip about 1,500 health off of you. There are also eight of them patrolling around a room near the end of the level. This entire area infuriated me so much that I defied my own usual rules with these kinds of games and rushed the rest of the game because I just wanted it to be over.There are also the dogs in this game, which WILL kill you repeatedly because there s no defending against them. Try to swing and they'll read your inputs and dodge away, try to block and they'll bounce too far off your shield for you to hit them, try to run away and they'll nibble on your ankle the moment you slow down to heal. If there are two of them on you, you might as well put your controller down because you won t win. Swinging blindly hoping that you'll tag them is seriously your best bet.Most of the bosses, final boss included, are more of a spectacle or something for fans to beat themselves off with using the game s lore that was hastily stapled onto it for fan service than a genuine challenge on a level playing field. Once I was finally able to kill most of them, my initial reaction was a sigh of relief at the fact that I didn't have to slog through it again rather than what should have been a respectful salute to the worthy adversary that I d just defeated. For the most part, they re predictable like clockwork, stunlock-happy and deal way too much damage.Fanbase pandering is absolutely everywhere in this game and it s worse than it s ever been. I can t possibly go over them all with the 8,000 character limit, but as a few examples: When you first run into this game s hub world, Andre makes his return from Dark Souls as your blacksmith. There s no reason for this, he s just there. Later in the game, you will return to a frozen version of Anor Londo and there are chests dotted around the area that contain equipment that s all ripped right from Dark Souls. They re not even boss soul items or picked up through a questline or anything, they re just in chests for you to find.In closing: This game is actually so bad that after I finished it for the first time, not only did I fully reverse my initial idea that my first playthrough of Dark Souls 3 was simply the exploratory phase and I don t yet have the first hand experience or knowledge to consistently overcome it, but I revised my initial thoughts on whether I was actually having fun with all of these games, or simply tolerating them so I could squeeze whatever little bits of enjoyment that I could get out of them. If there s some aspect of this game that I'm simply not seeing that pushes it to the glowing 9/10 scores that everybody else are giving it, then that s great. I would love to be proven wrong and actually begin to enjoy it again.This review was written before any of the DLC came out, so if the Rusted Iron Ring makes a return and updates make it so the enemies that don t have wind-up on their attacks are given some, the enemies that can attack you relentlessly are given a limit on their stamina and the damage you receive is toned down to more reasonable levels, then that would fix every major problem that I have with this game and I would happily change this to a recommendation. Until then, avoid this game.DLC UPDATE:Both DLCs consist almost entirely of enemies and bosses that have their stats bumped up to absurd levels, bosses that are either endurance tests or ganks, the latter of which is including one that calls back to the much better-executed Old Monk from Demon's Souls, one more recycled Patches questline and the best reason there is to go through any of it is to play around with the new and almost entirely useless flashy weapons and spells, then get bored after a few minutes. If DS3 is anything less than your favourite game ever, don't buy them.",0

Negative,"Written with the assmption the reader is familiar with gneral Soulslike game play.It's alright. I'd give it a 65/100 overall all things considered, because it has some decent stuff, but a lot of awful. It is the same old rubbish, but addictive to play. Story is pretty average and again takes exploration and item reading to get more details etc. Online has some improvements with password matching to allow friends to play together. Twinks are dead now they get matched together not with less geared players. Combat is the same other than poise is dead and there is a stupid automatic 2 hit stun system in place, pvp has devolved into the same 1-2 weapons and builds over and over. Enemies frequently have shitty movesets that are jsut endless spamming with infinite stamina. They are ""smarter"" so backstabs are harder. They jsut turn around on the spot faster basically. Parries are mostly dead due to the spammy attacks of many mobs. Fashion souls rules as armour effectiveness is mostly normalised.Terrible issues with ingame bugs, arent being fixed, were known about before western release as shown by the sudden increase in ""recommended specs"" to play the game. Fromsoft dont give a fvck, they put out a product that has the capacity to be a total potato, work arounds were found by players, but lower the game experience. Fromsoft's solution: ""buy a better computer and you MIGHT be fine"".Currently massive problems with false flagging for softbans, range of reasons why this may be, again Fromsoft and Bamco dont give a fvck as demonstrated by their being no resolution method in place other than using Steam Family Share (that is literally their solution). Developers have claimed they reviewing the bans on a case by case basis and will resolve false flags. So far no reports of people seeing any action.I would say avoid this game unless you are intent on playing it, it wont rock your world or anything like that, it can be fun if you accept the bugs and crashes and are prepared before hand. If ytou must own it, maybe give it another month and see if the makers actually do something to fix the issues, or jsut wait for a steam sale.a big one.",0
Negative,Not a fun game if you just want casual play with your friends.,0
Negative,I hate this game but my friends keep making me play it,0
Negative,"Honestly, the game is just really boring. 80% of enemies are fodder that die in two hits and will never ever challenge you (unless they gang up on you). 80% of bosses are absolute jokes and can be killed on your first attempt. The Lords of Cinder are extremely difficult though and will take anywhere from 15-30 attempts. Most of the ""difficulty"" of the game is artificial and just feels like padding, IF it's even difficult at all; as I said, most enemies are fodder and a lot of levels don't challenge you at all.You could condense this whole game down to a 3 hour experience fighting just the main bosses and it'd be far more enjoyable. Everything in between is just a waste of your time.",0
Negative,"Dark Souls 3 might be one of the easiest games I've played. From the straightforward combat to the predictable enemy patterns, there were very few challenges that posed a threat. The bosses? Simply a walk in the park. Overall, if you're looking for a game that requires minimal effort, Dark Souls 3 is the one for you.Great world tho.-Garry",0
Negative,"I should preface this review by stating that I like Dark Souls 3 as a whole. What I dislike about Dark Souls 3 come largely down to story and mechanics, namely the massive system changes that occurred from Dark Souls 1 to Dark Souls 3 (and 2, though to a lesser degree).To begin with what I like, the level design is a stand-out, as is the art direction and general graphical effects of the game. In comparison to prior games, 3 definitely feels like the most pretty and most like Dark Souls 1 in terms of level design with sprawling maps that always seem to have a way back to your origin point. It is, overall, one of the best games released in its year. On what I dislike about the game,1. Changes to PVP and Health: In Dark Souls 1, you use Humanity at a Bonfire and become Human. This enables both PVP and Co-op in the world, and you can be invaded at random. There is no real mechanical bonus to being Human outside of turning on these mechanics and you can go the entire game without ever becoming Human.In Dark Souls 2, the whole system is muddied and frankly terrible. There's no distinction between ""Invasion On"" and ""Invasion Off,"" though the game prioritizes Human players to invade based on Soul Memory. It's a mess.In Dark Souls 3, Embering gives you bonus HP and turns on PVP. This means that in order to get access to additional HP beyond the amount granted by Vigor, you have to turn on PVP and risk being invaded at random. You are automatically Embered after every boss kill, meaning that you get bonus HP. But also run the risk of invasion. PVP would be okay if lag and other issues weren't present, but being forced into the system by design means that PVP players go up against unsuspecting PVE players and Embering is arguably more detrimental than beneficial, bar the health boost that can help with tackling later game zones. In a word, the whole system is awful and I can see why they abandoned it for Elden Ring.2. Firelink Shrine. In Dark Souls 1, Firelink Shrine was a sort of hub where you could go to get more uses of your Estus and it was functionally connected to everything. At the same time, you never really had to go back there other than for ease of access to certain zones.In Dark Souls 3, Firelink Shrine is now a necessity. You have to go there to level up. You have to go there to improve weapons. It's all hidden behind a loading screen, meaning slower systems will have to stare at lore on repeat throughout the entire game. The worst part by far is the repetitive dialogue any time you want to level-up. It was a problem in Dark Souls 2, Bloodborne and a problem here. Elden Ring wisely did away with this system (at least for leveling) and that's a far better system. Dark Souls 1 did it better with the Bonfire level up too. It's a problem that never goes away and just gets more annoying the more you play.3. Lore: Dark Souls 3 is too focused on being a sequel to Dark Souls 1 (not 2, it references it occasionally, but it borderline ignores it) where it feels that the focus is on the ramifications and results of the original game and not on the lore of the new one. Dark Souls 2 had this problem to what I would argue is a lesser degree, albeit it was a bit too heavy-handed. Dark Souls 3 just name-drops important characters from Dark Souls 1 and copy-and-pastes an area from the first game into the third. This is okay because that area is still cool, but it feels a bit. Tired. I would have preferred something new, something completely distinct from what we got.It feels like two games. One game is trying to have new lore, new experiences and new things while the other game is trying desperately hard to flash the words ""DARK SOULS 1 IS HERE"" in your face whenever it can.4. Ignoring Dark Souls 2's Cool Bits: Dark Souls 2 is a divisive entry, and for good reason. However, it had some neat ideas, particularly hyperstancing weapons. This basically meant that, with the right stats, you could wield two weapons of the same type and gain access to a new moveset. Dark Souls 3 cans this entirely and gives you paired weapons. While this does open up the ability to use a stat-improving shield, like the Grass Crest Shield, it removes the unique flavor of hyperstancing entirely. Covenants are also back, but I feel that they're a little bit tacked on and less important this time around. No more Arenas for the Blue Sentinels or the Invaders, no more Covenant of Champions to turn on hard mode. There's also no real rewards for a no-Bonfire run (which is impossible anyway due to the design of the game) or for never dying, both of which Dark Souls 2 had.Particularly disappointing is that NG+ in Dark Souls 3 does nothing but increase difficulty (and add higher level varaints of rings), whereas Dark Souls 2 revamped zones with new enemy placements new item drops and more. Dark Souls 2 felt like an entire new game in NG+5. The Bloodborne Effect: This one is a bit more mixed for me. This game clearly has some Bloodborne in it, which is good on one hand because Bloodborne is great. It's bad on another because it feels like they didn't go hard enough on making it Dark Souls and not Bloodborne. The speed of the game is increased, but Shields are back so you can be more passive. Armor doesn't matter as much because of lack of upgrades, and the Poise system being kind of terrible (only activates on swinging some weapons) means that there's less incentive to actually be a big tanky hero like in Dark Souls 1. The lack of a Rally system (damage enemies to replenish recently lost HP) also means that being in close is punished. It's a bit confused as to what it wants to be, in this regard. Workable, as I've beat the game several times, but it feels unrefined. -In closing - Dark Souls 3 is a sequel to Dark Souls 1. It's not bad, but it's not hitting the same highs as Dark Souls 1, Bloodborne or Elden Ring for me. Bear in mind that, with all of the things I dislike, none of the Dark Souls games are truly awful and all of them are incredible purchases, well worth your time. I just so happen to dislike Dark Souls 3 the most of them all. Granted, most everyone has already bought this game, so this hardly matters anyway.",0
Negative,They didn't even bother to change keys when porting from console.,0
Negative,The input delay and action queueing is crazy stupid.,0
Negative,Not a good coop game.,0
Negative,It's the exact same game as the last two with the exact same problems: It's a terrible console port that insists you use a controller.,0
Negative,This game is DOGSUIT,0
Negative,"This game has a love-hate relationship with me. I nearly beat this game on Xbox One, and later bought the game on PC at one point.The game has a lot of improvements on the formula: allowing heavier builds to still be viable for rolling, making magic regenerative in some ways, etc. However, this game has issues, and one of them I unfortunately have to blame on Bloodborne.Because Miyazaki wanted players to play more aggressively, shields might as well be useless as every enemy has at least one way of breaking your guard or damaging you through your shield. This in turn basically forces a playstyle on the player rather than allowing them to experiment. This forced playstyle is also damaged as HEAVY builds don't work like DS1 and lose their original viability, where players used to tank damage trades rather than being staggered. The DLC content also took a hit, having less obvious connection to the story of the base game and recycling bosses in a way that feels like DS2's lazy design.To make things worse, there's the anti-cheat, which has been so poorly implemented that it has ignored actual cheaters and has hurt normal players for having encountered cheaters.The only thing I can say beyond this is that the team behind the Demon's Souls Remake seem to have identified a lot of the issues with the Soulsborne series while at the same time ignoring things that made the series and Demon's good in the first place, as the combat has returned to DeS's system, character creation has greatly improved, but the visual design of areas has fallen flat and sound design falling short as well. I hope that these improvements stick with future Souls-like games out of FromSoftware and that SONY lessens their grip and allows for a PC port of DeS Remake.",0
Negative,"game gud, internet full of 'how to fix' guides.",0
Negative,"Let me start off by saying that the PvE in this game was excellent. It was a significant improvement over Dark Souls 2 and I enjoyed most of it. My issue with the game comes from the fact that poise does not function as it did in either of the last two games. This wasn't much of a problem in the PvE (except for the small enemy gank/spam fests that seem to occur, especially with rats) but it really hurts the PvP aspect of the game. If you don't really care about PvP then you can stop reading here but if you do care about the PvP you might want to keep reading.I feel like a good 70% of my issues with PvP could be solved by making poise work like it did in Dark Souls 1 and 2 (though maybe to a greater/lesser extent depending on balancing). My experience was that most people just spam R1 with things like Estoc or Dark Sword. Bleed builds are also pretty annoying. These two things in particular wouldn't be so bad if you could poise through it. I primarily played on a quality build. I tried to use several weapons but would default to the Profaned Greatsword a lot of the time for the hyper armor and because the 2H R1 can't be parried.A couple other things that didn't bother me too much but might bother others a lot:1) If you invade someone you almost always end up fighting 2 or more people2) Casters are harder to play as because the stat and gear investment is pretty high. I don't see too many in PvP and I think it's because of one of those reasons.",0
Negative,"i have cried, screamed, and built up hatred towards myself while playing this game. I cannot stand the difficulty and ear raped many in a discord call whilst streaming. Lord save my soul from elden ring when i finish this game",0

Negative,In my opinion it is a step down from previous entries.,0
Negative,"Game good. But since the devs are being a pain and removing the servers, i'll be a pain as well and leave a bad review. Bring back multiplayer if you want a better one.",0
Negative,"What with softbanning for no reason and poise not working, I cannot recommend this game as it is.",0
Negative,Another blatant copy of Elden Ring,0
Negative,"Props to anyone who can tolerate the PvP in this godforsaken piece of shit. Phantom hits, the piss poor latency that half of the afrikaan tribesmen use in this game and the horrific hitboxes ruin every duel. ""Buh, buh, buh, Beenus, just git gud."" I have, and I've used the broken hitboxes to my advantages and it's not even fun winning at that point. It feels dirty. If you're a huge fan of the souls series, you'll at least enjoy the PvE. PvP is beyond broken and should be removed completely.",0
Negative,"Honestly, this game sucks. I love Dark Souls. It's my favorite game, but this game should have been infinitely better. It's way worse than Dark Souls, and, I can honestly say, it's worse than Dark Souls 2. Personally, I love Dark Souls 2, but I understand the complaints. It doesn't feel like Dark Souls (1) at all. But. Dark Souls 3? What is it? Well, it's an atrocity. It's atrocious. Ironically, it's also the easiest game in the series. It feels like Bloodborne with a legit shield option, so. not Bloodborne. The game is more linear than Dark Souls 2, so a far-cry from the beautiful and nostalgic level design of Dark Souls. The game is grey. Everything is desaturated. It looks like a Zack Snyder movie with less style. Almost everything is a re-skin of something from an earlier game. The original stuff we get (aside from the Nameless King, even though his area is a discount version of the Dragon Aerie) is dumb: Vordt the fat metal deformed man from ice land (not Eleum Loyce), The Dancer (pretty fun fight actually), Lothric and Lorian. kinda boring. Gundyr is pretty cool, but he's just a different, quicker version of the Looking Glass Knight. The DLCs are a mess. Ariandel is consistently cool, nothing close to the Oolacile DLC or even one of the DLCs from DS2 (considering their size). BUT, the Ringed City. okay, it's cool. There's a lot of great stuff there; HOWEVER, no one on earth can convince me that the good ol' ""Halflight, Spear of the Church"" is in ANY way not the absolute worst thing in any Soulsborne game in existence. It SUCKS. Everytime I get to this boss, it's worse than the Bed of Chaos. It's the only boss in any of the games that actually forces me to quit out of the game and turn steam into offline mode, beat the boss in a few short moments, and then turn the game off again to switch steam back into online mode. I understand if someone had a good experience fighting a legit PvP fight for this boss, that's just great, but every time I enter the fog, I'm faced with an untouchable fat man wielding a tiny little poker to chip away at my health for two hours until all my estus is gone. The best part is that he gets to throw some shiny spears in the ground and heal. AS MANY TIMES AS HE WANTS. This fight completely ruined my experience fighting Gael. I never want to fight Gael anymore because I have to go through this guy. Just the memories of the wasted hours in that room make me want to skip Gael every time. Look, when Dark Souls 3 came out, I was one of the most excited people to play it. I actually opened the special edition box up right when it came in the mail and played it on my brother's PS4 long before he (who actually bought the game) got home from work. He wasn't too happy. I've tried to love this game. Heck, I've tried to like this game. But, after hours of returning to it, and constantly subconsciously critiquing it and comparing it to the previous two games and pointing out the infinite amount of things that should have been in the game, not been in the game, or just been better in general. I have concluded that Dark Souls 3, within the context of the Dark Souls series, is a terrible game.More Bad Things About Dark Souls 3:- PvP: it's either a gank fest lasting for 30+ minutes, a hacker that breaks your game and gets reported, a duel arena you really did not feel like doing, or you get lucky and kill a noob in a few minutes. DS3 also apparently hates invaders, so it gave them the absolute shortest straw imaginable.- PvE: R1, R1, R1, R1, R1, R1. oh, you want to be a sorcerer. Who cares!? Go play Dark Souls 2 you creep.- Armor sets: they no longer give special effects, one of the coolest things DS2 added. There's also only like four new cool looking sets. Everything else that is cool is cool because it's from DS1.- Dual wielding: it's a lie.- Hexes: Where are the hexes? I just wanted some hexes. :'(- Bosses: at least I remember the Covetous Demon because he was funny. I always seem to forget about the giant tree with gonads on his hands.- NPCs: .I love the NPCs in Dark Souls. They are beautiful people, well, most of them. But, they are all memorable. You follow them through the game and can often determine their fate. There was a lot of this in DS2 as well. In 3? we get. Greirat. and Hawkwood. and some knight with a deep voice trying to keep some girl from losing her innocence. they're all short and disconnected. Greirat is not too disconnected, but the main problem is that everyone just teleports back to the game's hub for some wierd unexplained reason. it seems lazy. Anri's questline is fine. Anri and Horace, they are fine. But it's safe to say every quest line in the game should have been like Anri's. They were in the first game, and this is the third. Logically, it should be better. - Firelink: it sucks. It's just a hub you have to teleport back to because it's on a floaty mountain that is connected to nothing. It's like the dream place from Bloodborne. If I wanted a Bloodborne dream-hub place, I would play Bloodborne. Dark Souls is supposed to be connected by paths, like a Dark Souls game. You can literally beat DS2 without resting at a single bonfire. it's kinda sick. You hardly have to at all in Dark Souls. But DS3? Oh, you are FORCED to rest at the bonfire to get to the first area in the game. This is bad game design.These, and numerous other reasons are why I firmly believe Dark Souls 3 is awful. Thank you. Please go play the first game if you haven't. It's amazing. I wish the remaster actually finished Lost Izalith and left everything else exactly the same, aside from a few technical issues; then the world would legit have a PERFECT GAME.",0
Negative,"As of right now i must sadly say no. The game seems to run at a decent framerate, I do experience some skipping but not enough to really complain at all! The environments i have seen thusfar are very beautiful and make the game seem oh so very expansive. Sadly where I mark this review negative is the unpreparedness of both From software and Bandai Namco as to how they handled this release. The game has been on the eastern market almost a week now yet the game suffers from many simple bugs that should have by now already been dealt with for a worldwide release. Bandai's excuse is not to play the game early yet I am currently playing it on the expected date and time. Currently for me I cannot proceed at all thanks to a bug in which I cannot be killed yet my enemies cannot either; we simply phase through one another due a bug involving hitboxes staying where that enemy spawns. Uncircumventable I must wait until a patch has been done or refund the game. This was your baby From Software, and you aborted the HELL out of it. Hopefully when they fix this i can return and give it a much more proper review, but for now I am jsut disappointed.",0

Negative,"This game is fun, though its difficult. The reason I can't recommend the game though is because of the completly unbalanced pvp. Starting off with just starting the game you will lose is pvp every time. EVERY TIME. Not a game that can be played with friends due to the balance issues. Its a shame the very community of dark souls ruins the experience for the players who are just starting out.",0
Negative,"They literally couldn't come up with anything new, so they decided ""hey all those guys who played dark souls, but never got the chance to play demon's souls, let's just make it like that""Essentially From went back on all their ideas and changes of Demon's Souls to Dark Souls. Mana? It's back. The main hub? It's the Nexus, tell me I'm wrong. The Fire Keeper? It is literally the Maiden in Black don't fucking tell me I'm wrong. Every game has shared the same themes, but this one just blatantly copies. Why can't you upgrade armor anymore? Were people actually happy about this change? That was one of the biggest issues with Demon's Souls, armor would fall off later on because it couldn't keep up with the damage values.I'd say hands down the worst part of this game is the enemy design. In the other games choreography was one of it's strongest points. Enemy telegraphed their moves, it was clear what was going to happen, it was down to the player to handle it. In this, literally every single enemy just negates this idea entirely because they just unleash a barrage of attacks without any warning whatsoever. It could be the fattest of all Smoughs, and he suddenly whips out two giant swords and spins about 30 times before stopping, all within a second. Nothing ever feels interesting or engaging because half the time I just know my opponent is going to spam some stupid crap that I'm just gonna have to dodge for a while. One of the worst feelings with this, was when I discovered the game favors offense to the absolute silliest degree. When I die time and time again to a single enemy, trying to devise all methods of strategies. When it turns out just normal attacking him over and over not only proved more efficient and effective, but safer. Combat becomes trivialized at the weirdest intervals. Nothing feels tactical anymore, just braindead. Obviously not all fights are like this, but a vast majority are solved just by attacking more and caring less.Speaking of they more a less removed any kind of tanking in this game. With armor not working well, and too many attacks to block with reasonable stamina, it's entirely Dodge Souls now. It's boring. I never felt like I was dodging because I wanted to play that way, it felt it was a requirement no matter what. It's uninteresting.Leveling felt awkward to say the least. Scaling of stats didn't seem nearly as important as putting all of it into health and stamina did. I'm not sure why they built it like this but once I got the necessary stats to equip my weapons of choice (whip and a dagger) I never once put another point into strength, dexterity, nor intelligence or faith. It just all went into my red and green bars.Covenants are. well they're fine. Nothing wrong with them. They don't feel as interactive as previous games but, at least my sunbros are still there. The mad men was an interesting idea, if a bit weak.Oh and if you thought the questlines in other games were hard to understand? These ones are just impossible. I only found out after I beat the game and looked it up that I failed like, over half of them without ever knowing it.I'm not sure why everyone raves about how awesome DaS 3 is. It feels entirely weaker to it's predecessors and felt like it was just trying to encapsulate Demon's Souls in some capacity instead. Was it all the Bloodbourne hype? Cause I never played that.Just go play the first game.",0

Negative,"DS3 is the worst in the series.I have played well over 200 hours on DS and DS2. With a few exceptions, nearly every aspect of the earlier entries in the series was better.Pros: Dark Souls 3 does very little better than the previous games, but what it does do is commendable. DS3 does away with the life gems and rings of protection found in DS2 (IMO the only major flaws of DS2), but includes a way of farming embers by assisting other players with bosses. and thats about it. Everything else sucks.CONS: FROM took a page out of Bethesda's book and left every fucking bug and glitch possible in the game. The game is optimized worse than software I've written while drunk and I'm constantly kicked back to the main menu for framerate issues. Issues I DO NOT HAVE running MGS V, XCOM2, and other games that I own on ultra settings. This hit detection in this game has gotten much, much, muuuuuuuuuuuuch worse than it wsa in the previous two games, resulting in me losing PVP battles and PVE fights where the attack came no where near me. Sometimes nearly the width of my screen away. The Finely tuned combat system of the previous two games has been ditched in favor of artificial difficulty created through cheesy gimmicks like dropping your locked on target when you roll a little to the side or past them, eliminating poise, and giving half the mobs idiotic levels of multi-hit combos.The difficulty starts off at a nice spike from the previous two games (assuming you start as deprived) but very quickly levels off and becomes pointlessly sedate, so much so that grinding your way past 3 or 4 bonfires without stopping to rest is easily achieveable, even in unfamiliar zones, don't worry, you'll still die, it will just be to stupid shit like giant fucking crossbows raining death on you from above, crowds of undead running around with trees as weapons, and the predictable ambush waiting around every fucking corner in the game.seriously, that is massively overplayed.Onto the game design, or lack thereof. Unlike the previous two entries the zones all feel uninspired and lazy. The enemies are all 10 feet tall, which makes no fucking sense (am I playing a midget?). The bosses are largely forgetteable - in fact, the first boss was one of the 'hardest'. Half the characters from DS1 are shoehorned in. The whole experience feels mighty bland. It sorta feels like Miyazaki just ran out of ideas after DS and BB. Just go buy DS2 Scholar of the First Sin.",0

Negative,"Forced to say that I don't like the game because a review can't be blank, so might as well type, am I right? I'd rather play Darksouls 1 for the 99th time, or Darksouls 2 for the 87th! I've had this game in my library for a long time, and every time I go to play it, I just end up hating everything about it, from the horrible lock-on jank, to the fact that the binoculars don't work like they do in darksouls 1 and 2. And then there is the fact that you fall like a sack of lead bricks whenever you try to ""jump"". As it has been far too long since I've gotten it to get a refund (Which I honestly would've gotten before), I will beat this game and then never touch it again. I don't even care if I get the ""True ending"" or whatever. I just want to beat it, and never think about it ever again for the rest of my life. This game is hot trash to me.Edit: After having played through the entirety of this game, I decided that I would only EVER use bows in this because they felt the LEAST horrible weapon to use in this game. And yes, I killed the gimmick Giant without using Storm Ruler. Did the entire game (no dlcs), including optional bosses, were slain. The first two/three zones are garbage. Some zones later on are just poorly designed, namely archdragon peak and its ""wyvern"". The final boss, I 1st tried. The Unknown King was a better fight than the final boss sadly. I give this game a 5/10. Get it discounted and not for full price. Or play Elden Ring. Elden Ring is so much better than this in entirety.",0

Negative,"I don't usually write reviews bud there is too much circle jerk about this game, back controls, bad game play, clunky feelings controls, no PC options all only xbox (really?) I came to the game to try it because people said it was a hard game, it isn't hard it has bad mechanics. It's not difficult it's difficult to control because of terrible coding. Just avoid it unless you have the patience to get used to the crappy controls.",0
Negative,"To be honest, I suck at this game. But I suck at Mordhau, too, and still I enjoy playing Mordhau while I find playing Dark Souls abhorrent. Mostly this is because this is such an low effort port that demanding 60 euros for it, is like a big, fat slap in your face (I paid 10 euros though!). The game is locked at 60fps and there is no changing that. Game gives you plenty hints and tutorials but ALL THE BUTTONS shown to you are from the Xbox controller so if you wanna know which button to press, you have to look it up in the menu. The implementation of AA is poor at best, ridiculously blurry and/or grain (sic!) most of the times. Controls are clunky as hell. Now, now, I get it. The beauty of this game is mastering the clunky controls and then just internalize all the right movements so your very own body is the one playing this game and not your videogame mind. However, I refuse playing a game in which your enemies can change the direction of a strike in the middle of the animation while you yourself are forced to strike in the direction you clicked. That renders your enemies highly dynamic while you are just completely static. People like it, obviously, but I find it pretty cheap design. I had much more fun with Sekiro, it felt much more fluid to me. But even here you have that other ""feature"" that makes your enemies respawn whenever you die or you rest at a resting place. More often than not you have to kill a dozen of enemies over and over and over and over and over again to get to the boss, then get slaughtered by the boss, then repeat that, then almost beat the boss but get defeated eventually since your character was just standing there, then you repeat again until you made it. You come to realize that you have just spent 2 hours on a small portion of a level. For me, that is a waste of time.Hey, and before you cry about me being mad because I am bad, you must understand how utterly ridiculous such a statement would sound if you only knew what kind of games I usually play. Summa summarum: I wouldn't mind biting my teeth into this game to git gud but the pisspoor port, the bad graphics, the clunkiness and the highly artificial difficulty discourages me from the get-go whenever I come around to re-install this game.Oh, and btw: the mouse settings! 1 of 10 feels like, well 1 of 10 but increasing the mouse sensitivity to 2 of 10 is ridiculously fast all of a sudden. Yeah, so good luck trying to find the right setting with a 144hz display.",0
Negative,F*ck this anti-PC game. FromSoftware couldn't be bothered to accommodate the most basic widescreen and keyboard/mouse conventions and I regret having spent both the time trying to make it work and the money to buy it. This game belongs on a console.,0
Negative,"i thought id try it just to see what the hype is all about. upon playing, i realized that i would probably spend most my time resurrecting and redoing the stages over and over while leaving no room for actual fun gameplay. shame that this wasnt just for everyone.",0
Negative,Does not support 3440 x 1440.Like previous DS games it looks and feels like a cheap console port displaying confusing console controls. Very disappointing and certainly not worth the money! Wait until it is discounted as it should be priced as a 6 year old port it looks and plays like.,0
Negative,"Note that coop is part time ghost Co-op only. No progression for Co-op partner. Co-op partner is rendered as a phantom. Co-op partner is only available for a limited duration after collecting specific resources in game to enable Co-op play. Once expended, resources must be collected again.

Negative,"They took ""The Dark Souls Game"" and heaped piles of faeces on it.Rolls are queued and still action after the player character takes a hit (even after a single button press). Camera is the greatest enemy when facing larger bosses, they are all larger bosses. Give us ""Bloodborne"" for PC you cowards.",0
Negative,"what if you took the enemy design and aggression of bloodborne, but kept the swing speed and character mobility of dark souls? good thing the ashen one doesnt have a stomach for all the rolling you're constantly expected to do.",0
Negative,"This game is amazing! BUT.1. I'm a mouse and keyboard guy, and this game has very poor support for keyboard and mouse controls. I had to customize my keybindings which is normal. But all messages are like press R1 to slash. I had to keep on going back to the keyboard bindings menu to know what is R1 in keyboard.2. Does not support ultrawide screens 21:9.3. 60 FPS lock.If you don't mind issues I mentioned above, then I highly recommend this game. Gameplay alone is so good. I like the feeling that every enemy is like a boss fight. You have to take each encounter seriously. No rushing in because you got big guns, that's what will get you killed. That feeling of dodging those epic boss attacks is trully the best feature of the game. You only have a split second to decide if you are going to block, parry, or roll in a certain direction, dash in or out, attack, and what kind of attack, or just wait. Combo attacks need you to press the button fast but this forces you to do the combo, which means you are open if the enemy can dodge or take the initial attack without flinching. If you press the buttons too slow, this gives and opening to your enemies and they can roll out or counter.- This part is a steam refund story -So my reasons for wanting a refund were because of those 3 mentioned above. And there was nothing in the game description that it doesn't fully support ultrawide screens, the keyboard and mouse support is subpar, and nothing about 60 fps lock.Rules for a refund are it has to be within 14 days of purchase and less than 2 hours of playing. My problem was I spent the first few hours creating my character. The background was black so I didn't notice that this game just fills the sides with black bars to ""support"" 21:9. There was also an option to change the resolution to 3440x1440 which is 21:9. So I assumed that this game supports it while I was making my character.I was all excited playing this game at first that I didn't notice the black bars. There was so many epic moments from the start of the game that kept me busy enough to not notice them. The moment I realized my problem was when I got the binoculars item. It's an item that you can use the view your surrounding. I saw black bars when using them, and black bars when I took them off. I went through the settings, but still black bars.I had to download and use a third party program so that I can view the game without black bars. Finished the game, again it was so awesome. But I will not recommend this game, not until they support 21:9 resolution, and they properly support keyboard and mouse controls in their dialogues.",0

Negative,"Score: 6/10 DARK SOULS III is a game that s well-known for its punishing difficulty, but for many players, that challenge can cross the line into sheer frustration, making the experience more aggravating than rewarding.The game s combat, which is often praised for its precision and depth, can feel more like a test of patience than skill. DARK SOULS III is unforgiving, sometimes to a fault. The difficulty spikes are frequent and harsh, often requiring repeated grinding or perfect execution just to progress. This isn t just about learning enemy patterns or mastering mechanics it s about enduring the relentless barrage of obstacles that the game throws at you, sometimes with little room for error. While some players might relish the idea of overcoming these challenges, for others, it can feel more like an exercise in frustration.The bosses, while visually impressive and creatively designed, are often a source of intense aggravation. Many of these encounters rely heavily on trial and error, punishing players with one-hit kills or relentless attack patterns that leave little room for recovery. This can lead to extended periods of retrying the same fight over and over, chipping away at your patience and enjoyment of the game. Rather than feeling like rewarding tests of your skill, these encounters can come across as unfair hurdles that you just have to get through.The difficulty is compounded by the game s checkpoint system, which can be brutal. The distance between bonfires (the game s checkpoints) and boss fights or tough enemy gauntlets can be extensive, meaning that failure often sends you back a significant way, forcing you to repeat challenging sections multiple times. This can turn what should be a tense, exciting journey into a frustrating grind.Technical issues also play a role in the difficulty. Frame rate drops and stuttering, especially in high-pressure situations, can lead to mistimed dodges or missed attacks, adding an additional layer of frustration. In a game where precision is key, these performance problems can make an already difficult game feel even more punishing.The multiplayer aspect, while a core part of the Dark Souls experience, doesn t do much to alleviate the difficulty. Invasions can disrupt your progress at the worst possible moments, adding yet another layer of challenge that might feel more like an unwelcome interruption than an exciting feature. While summoning help is possible, the inconsistency of the multiplayer connectivity can make it a hit-or-miss experience, leaving you to face the game s toughest challenges on your own.In summary, DARK SOULS III is a game that prides itself on its difficulty, but that same difficulty can be its downfall. While it s a well-crafted game with impressive visuals and deep lore, the relentless challenge, combined with technical issues and a punishing checkpoint system, can make it more frustrating than fun. If you re a glutton for punishment, you might find something to enjoy here, but for many, DARK SOULS III will likely be more aggravating than rewarding.",0
Negative,dark souls 3 sucks big wang the people suck,0
Negative,"I have finished a couple of ""Souls like"" before, but I had no idea how much harder the real deal is: even after 40 hours and putting a third of my points into stamina at level 55, playing that game is still extremely stressful and physically painful to me. You *never* get any time to relax. There will always be a trap, an enemy that you didn't see or just cannot be seen (like slimes falling from the ceilng that cannot be seen in advance) that will destroy half your health out of nowhere, or a group of small enemies that are simply impossible to kill because there are too many of them.The difficulty of the game resides it two main things: every single enemy hits extremely hard, and they all have infinite stamina (which is what determines how much you can dodge, parry and hit). On top of that, all the dangerous enemies (more or less 30% of the enemies, not counting bosses) are much better than you at everything: more reach, faster, stronger, more health. And again: INFINITE.F*CKING.STAMINA. When you try to hit the shield of an enemy, you will bounce off it and will be briefly opened to counter attacks. Most enemies don't have that: they can just keep hitting your shield again and again without interruption and without bouncing off it until you have no more stamina, then finish you off, or just constantly spam a very powerful, uninterruptible combo with very few openings.Not impossible, but I'm not sure I'll have the patience to keep going.",0
Negative,"Unbalanced game with cheese mechanics that are both counter-intuitive and broken to a certain extent. Complete lack of choice and freedom.PvP is summed into item swaping on the fly and indiscriminate use of consumables (where nerds dictate that one cannot use healing pots called Estus Flasks, everything else is fair game because they have ways of circumventing the need of healing pots, through, again, ridiculous item swaping)So you have to learn everything about the game before being able to do anything in it, while guides may give a wheelchair for some PvE content, mostly you must use everything in the game extensively to learn all of it's patterns, ranges, speeds and specials (called ""WeApOn aRtS"")There's no happy pvp (fair game where you 50/50), since the game relies on trash p2p connections you WILL lag a lot if either pvping or giving a helping hand to anyone, unless you gang friends to do stuff together. Which brings me to the ""gank gangs"" where fair fighting is out of question, if they can 100v1 you, they will pre-summon 100 friends and 100v1 you the moment you spawn with that 100 years length animation, and since the game is unbalanced as F, you can't even take proper ""revenge"" in any way. This all without mentioning cheaters (blatant amounts of those), who simply run around with 1hp unable to die, speed hack, become impossible to stagger, etc.Than there's the PvE which distances itself from the ""fair game"" DS1 was, AI cheats too, poise, never-ending-stamina, never-ending-mana (FP in this game, idk why the fancy new names to already known effing standards for any RPG-eske game). Builds are also quite unreliable, you basically max out dmg output or get stuck, defensive builds suck and mostly won't work, so it's all about rolling and offensive buffs (because you basically can only hit anything in small windows). Backstabbing was nerfed from DS1, so it isn't as a reliable tactic for the game, parrying became counter-intuitive cancer.Circumventing all these issues what are we left with? Use same weapons, if not, use same moves with different weapons for melee, roll attack twice, roll away, roll in, attack twice, roll away: rinse-repeat 99.9% of the game, than we have the 0.1% of locked mechanics = kill things this very specific way, or fail, or take 350 years to kill something through normal means. Another ""viable"" way is to use spells, which have awful aiming through binoculars (that take two centuries to play the ridiculous ""pickup binoculars look through them"" animation), or free aim for wasted mana, or lock on only when the enemy is on your face, not to mention the awesome controls for lock on, which basically spins your camera because if nothing is in range the geniuses from ""FROM"" decided to make it a camera centering bind, which you cannot unbind/change.Summing up: game is garbage, awful controls, bad interface, even worse mechanics that basically ask people to fiddle with their disgusting UI due to lack of proper basic key-mapping, while what is key-mapped is just awfully combined with unwanted commands/actions. Even messages on the ground can create problems during a fight due to this.Than we have the mongoloid train in Steam Forums of toxic kids who think they are ""DS3 PROS"" (as if the game had any Pro scene or was any sort of E-Sport, flash news: IT ISN'T BECAUSE IT'S COMPETITIVENESS SUCK, even the ""world record"" holders for speedruns rely on glitches and exploits to do almost the entirety of their runs, including constant quit/reload, navigating with noclip glitches, etc.) Basically it's community is a sum of a human cess-pool of failure.So yeah, can't really recommend this game. Used to love DS1, but as always, franchise went to feces like the rule of thumb for gaming industry demands.Have a nice one, hope you don't waste your money on this crapPS: Came late to the party, 6 years in my review doesn't have any effect nor helps much with anything.",0

Negative,PvE is just fine so about 40 hours of fun in the first walktraough. NG+ doesnt make sense because you just do the same thing again. PvP doesn't exist. as far as i get lvl 130 nobody invaded me once. and invading other players takes years and when you finaly find some1 to duel with its so lagging you want to cut your veins. thats because the game doesnt have dedicated servers.,0
Negative,"I played this game a bit in April of 2016. I didn't understand, why is it SO bad back then. Now when average online is 6-7k, it's absolutely unplayble. (DS2 was fun with 6-7k). Zero signs cause there is no rewards for help. even sunbros can get medals BY INVADING. There is no any arena that requires tokens. It's the most mainstream DSgame. Thats why so many egoistic persons play it. If u would ever find a lonely sign it will be placed in front of fog wall (not at the start of hur-durr location or even at nearest bonfire), Thank miyazakil for useless bonfires in every boss's room. But it's impossible to level up Darkmoon Covenant for example, cause U CAN'T INVADE SINNERS. Srsly, 'sin' means nothing in this game. Even in storyline. OFC, killing several NPC's has consequences but it's not about sin. U will never be summoned to defend a member of 'WoB' cause nobody uses this covenant cause there is no rewards for them.Can't deny that some boss fights r very beautifull, but that's not enough for single player game.

Negative,"Don't buy this on a PC and expect to play with a mouse and keyboard. It's not playable without a console style joystick game pad; there are too many combo button presses, and everything is described in terms of what game pad buttons to press together. The PC keyboard usage isn't functional; for example you don't bind ""parry"" to a key, and find it ends up being something like multiple mouse buttons pressed together. I have a Razer naga with a 12-button keypad on the side and some functions end up mapped on multiple side buttons. I have only one thumb to press them with! It's simply not physically feasible to play without a gamepad. And I hate console joystick controls (or I'd use one!) - so this is $60 flushed down the toilet IMO.",0

All the same key - and you can't map those movements to different keys. The UI is a controller UI - and cannot be changed. Even as you play the game the ""hints"" you receive are controller hints - and meaningless if you are using a keyboard and mouse.

The camera will swoop around in a full 360 degrees any time you try to look only a smidgen in a different direction, and any time you defeat an enemy it will try and do a Final Fantasy style victory pose even when, say, you have other enemies you still need to fight that you now can't protect yourself against because the camera has you looking at the sky. There are no settings to turn this off, and turning down the mouse sensitivity (a feature my mouse had) did absolutely nothing.There's no skill here.

Negative,it not alright,0
Negative,This game freakin sucks.,0
Negative,Dark Souls 3 is poorly optimized with tons of random crashing and bugs. This game is also a terrible console port with the developers too lazy to implement mouse UI. It's also much easier compared to the older Dark Souls games. So If you are going to buy this game have a controller and wait until they patch everything.,0
Negative,"As much as I love the Dark Souls series, I honestly cannot recommend this game. The only positive I can honestly think of for this game is the graphics, they're gorgeous. Littered with issues both Online and Off.To start my biggest problem with the entire game of Dark Souls 3. Estus Flasks. This seems to fit in with part I'll mention later in the review but to start off, they returned Estus back to it's Dark Souls 1 roots. Which is not neccesarily a bad thing; but it is, it really is. Estsus flasks are a life saver regardless of what situation you're in, you can sort of walk and move while healing now, and it instantly fills most of your health bar, so if you're in a dire situation ever you can just chug that sweet Lucozade energy, low on health? Chug. Low on health AND about to be attacked by an enemy? Chug anyway, you'll be fine, just take the hit and drink again, then maybe you can think about getting out of the way. It's a hundred thousand times worse in PvP though, if you're in danger of dying just roll away and mash that heal button, chances are you'll heal and wont be punished due to how incredibly quick you heal and put away the flask, so PvP tends to boil down to nothing but an endurance contest seeing who can run out of flasks first, then and only then can you get a kill because punishing shit in this game is a mess. I personally preferred the slow heal of DS2 as it required to player to strategise when to heal and when it's not safe, making a wrong move means death. The speed of DS3 is more on par with Bloodborne however so it's understandable why they changed it for this one. It's less slow and methodical compared to 2.Rolling is also terrible, it's too easy, it gives too many i-frames, it barely uses any stamina. You can just roll and roll and roll around enemies in both PvP and PvE and be basically invincible. Completely saps any and all fun out of the game. Anyone with an inch of sense knows how to dodge in an unpredictable fashion and be impossible to punish. Poise is disabled and doesn't work. What this means; Online is people spamming the straight sword/Estoc because it's easy, and works surprsingly well. Incredibly effective if you mix up the swings so people can't parry it. Offline you can be stunlocked by a rat or two wearing either nothing at all, or full Havels. And that's the game, basically it seems some enemies in this game have poise, but most of the time it's just no poise, I spent a good hour trying to get the parry timings down for enemies in an area later on in the game, the parry window for one certain enemy seemed incredibly out of sync with how his swing attacks performed, but regardless of this, it was completely pointless as I could kill the enemy within seconds by repeatedly tapping the swing button and stun locked him with death. Pointless. Armour is absolutely useless in this game, the defenses you gain wearing the thickest armour in the game is negligible compared to wearing rags, so if you liked to play a tank character in DS1 or 2? Too bad. It's roll or nothing in this game.I understand they were going more for fashion souls in this game? I really don't care because it ruins heavy armour for those who like it. The game also has a decent amount of hackers that seem to have the ability to get you yourself banned from online play simply by hitting you.A recent revelation I've also read about online is phantom range, a large amount of the weapons in the game have range that extends beyond their physical hitbox, this seems to allow weapons like the straight sword to have range equal to greatswords. It also doesn't end there, the basic swords or rapiers have damage that is almost equal to most of the heavy weapons in the game, that swing infinitely faster, and require infinitely less stamina so to sum it up - there's little point to using any of the weapons other than the basic swords, unless you want to make it so much harder for yourself.This game is really disappointing to me as the previous two games were fuckin' wonderful, DS1 had the superior world and the lore, DS2 had the mechanically superb game/swordplay, which it seems they have largely thrown out in Dark Souls 3 for a much more boring, less intricate system, you also can no longer power stance weapons and instead are forced to only dual wield to specific weapons of the same type, which is incredibly upsetting as I loved mix and matching weapons to power stance in DS2. Dark Souls 3 however, has very little of it's own to offer aside from graphics, many of the areas to me are incredibly hard to remember, the swamp areas and the dungeon areas all just merge into one as they look incredibly bland. This is only saved however by the few areas that do in fact look fantastic and stand up on their own legs, areas like Irithyll of the Boreal Memory I won't soon forget. Which leads me into another point; the fellating. Dark Souls 3 has the biggest hard on for a previous game I think I've ever seen in any game series ever, this game of course being Dark Souls 1. In Dark Souls 3, From Software removed the shield breaker in favour of the kick as it was in Dark Souls 1, not only that, but the light roll animation has been changed back to the weird looking incredibly floaty roll from DS1. Now I wouldn't mind this at first, but the references keep coming strong and hard and really just fucking slap you in the face. Shortly after the tutorial area you stumble upon a building, upon entering this building you're met with a name - that name is ""Firelink Shrine"". Ok. Fine. You stumble around the area to get your bearings and then you hear a metallic clanking sound and you approach it. It's a blacksmith. The blacksmith. The exact same blacksmith from Dark Souls 1 - Andre of Astora, looking as if he hasn't actually aged a day since the events of DS1, despite it being seemingly numerous centuries after said events. And it just keeps going and going, another large one that I wasn't sure about how I felt about was an incredibly important, non optional area in DS3, you progress through an area and come to a lift, upon using said lift you are greeted with the sight of Anor Londo. I was disappointed by this because it feels fairly obvious that the entire area would have crumbled away since we first met the place, especially since an entire city seems to have built itself under it's foundations? Fan service is all well and good, but there's a point where it's just excessive.In the end, I found the gameplay of Dark Souls 3 to be rather incredibly unfun, tedious, repetitive, and quite boring. And I'm a big fan of the series, playing both DS1 and 2 multiple times in anticipation for the release of this game.Probably worth buying if you're a fan of the series but I honestly had a hard time finishing the game once I began nearing the end.TL;DR Summary I guess; The PvE is repetitive and boring, environments look great, PvP is incredibly boring and the worst in the franchise; even made worse by the fact that invaders are constantly at a disadvantage due to gank parties and spawning with less estus than the host.",0
Negative,"This game is a port, which will always result in poor production value.- This game is 'accepted' as requiring a controller to use due to the poor mouse emulation. I would love to be able to play this game free aiming my spells, looking in the direction I want and not being forced to take my finger off the roll button to rotate my camera.- 'Camera reset' button being the same as the 'target', this will get you killed, constantly, it is a constant stress knowing that you camera angle may suddenly face you in the opposite direction to the enemy. This is ESPECIALLY prevalent on bosses/mobs that teleport or jump out of your range due to your character automatically dropping target lock.- Peer to peer PVP - the lag/de-sync in pvp is the worst of any game I have ever played in my 20+ years of gaming, it breaks mechanics and results in a sloppy mess. It will, without a doubt, result in you trading blows with an enemy that should have been a 1 sided affair.- Partial parries - should flat out be removed from the game.GAMEPLAY, to be PERFECTLY CLEAR.You don't attack enemies, you swing => if the enemy is in the way => takes damage.Mobs/bosses do not do this, they have direct attacks that target you with incredible range and speed - you will never have access to this level of control.This is why Dark Souls games are 'hard', you as a player have a very basic moveset that makes you weak - this game was likely developed and your character/ weapons/spells were nerfed until a 'hard' level of gameplay was achieved.",0
Negative,"Without doubts the worst in the series, it isn't a bad game, mind you, but it does mean that I can't recommend it.I have much love for some parts of the pve experience, but due to a couple changes to the core mechanics (poise, stamina costs, infusions) the game just falls flat compared to the others in the series. It's like Fromsoftware took the worst out of both bloodborne and ds1, and mixed it together into this game. However I'd still recommend this if this is your first from the Dark Souls series, since it is the easiest to get into of all of them. But if you've played Dark souls 1 and 2, prepare to be disappointed.The good:-The ""story"" mode feels good to play through, DLC is good albeit a bit overpriced for the content you receive (mainly looking at ariandel here)-Cool bosses-Combat is unbelievably smooth-As usual, the games in the souls series have immense replayability-Lots of armor/weapons to pick and play withThe bad:-Enemies never seem to run out of stamina-Weapon balance is terrible in PvP, there's a couple weapons which you will encounter every other fight-Phantom hits in online play-Shields are pretty much useless in PvE/PvP-All areas are made out of either a brown or grey colour, which gets tiring rather quick-Poise mechanic is executed poorly-It barely matters whether you equip heavy or light armor.-The newly introduced Weapon Arts, while cool, lead to an incredibly stale pvp-experience where you will encounter the same kind of repeated weapon art combo every time.-Weapon arts are pretty much useless in most of the PvE content compared to regular attacksHaving said all this, I'd give Dark Souls 3 (Including DLC) a solid 6/10It's a worthwhile game to pick up if you're fresh to the souls series, but as a fan of the souls-series, I can't recommend it.",0

Negative,"While I love Dark Souls 3 as a game I can t in good faith recommend a game that bans people that have never cheated, this has happened to both me and a good friend of mine. I don t know if he did the same as me, which is deleting all save files and starting a new character, but the outcome was the same for the both of us, we got softbanned.In case it matters, I did not use CE/Sweet FX or anything along those lines, the only programm I have been using while playing the game was DS4 to get my controller to work with the game.So yeah, the game is great, their anti cheat/security system is utter trash.The only ""positive"" thing about this situation is the fact that you can bypass the softban by using family share, which would force me to start over again.Thanks FromSoft.",0
Negative,This game has an awful pvp system. Its a fun game and i love it but its extremely dumb how people who completed the game can come and invaded early levels and bully them none stop. You shouldn't be allowed to complete the game and invade fresh characters. League of legends has a better balancing system than this game. I give this game a thumbs down because League of legends is better at balancing and that deserves the ultimate punishment,0
Negative,"Previously, I would have recommended Dark Souls 3. However, after more than 6 months of the online services being down still, and still having the audacity to sell this as a full priced release is uncalled for, a game released in 2016. It's a 6 year old game, I think it's time for $29.99 for a solid single player experience.",0
Negative,"Its hard to deny that Dark Souls 3 is a good game. I had fun with it, and it did a lot of things well. However, there are still some massive flaws that kill the experience in a lot of ways for me. And shockingly, one of my main gripes is with lack of difficulty in many cases, something I've never thought I'd ever say when talking about this series. It is an objectively good game, but in terms of the Dark Souls series as a whole it is somewhat lacking. This review will focus on PvE, since enough people have burned the PvP in this game.FromSoftware did a lot of thing right, and they do deserve praise for those. First, humanity is finally well balanced. They changed the name to ember, and the only difference there is that being hollow is now optional; you retain your human appearence while not embered. Plus, being embered gives a 30% health boost, which gives reason to using it aside from multiplayer. Most of the bosses in the game are amazing. There's a lot more consistancy compared to Dark Souls II, with the really good ones being completely original bosses. Abyss Watchers is still one of my favorites, Pontiff Sulyvahn and the dancer are well designed and hard, and the tutorial boss is one of my favorites yet. The secret final boss has great design, breaking the trend of getting under the legs to win. The final boss is not as original, but its still such a good fight I honestly don't mind.Miyazaki is a genius when it comes to level design; almost everything in the PvE portion of the game is great. However, there's a few large problems I have with it. My main problem, and a rather game breaking problem at that, is that the enemies will almost never be in your way. Unless you need the time to look around and explore for items, or are doing co-op, it is almost always disadvantageous to fight. Sure if you mess up you will get ganked and probably die, but not many enemies will be able to keep up with you while sprinting. From what I've found, its usually only the dogs or the pontiff knights you have to worry about. Almost every area in the game follows a pattern of putting a lot of elite enemies right at the start of a level, most of which will aggro in groups unless you lure one at a time with a ranged weapon, and after the first bonfire they're spread out evenly. The idea is clear; you're just supposed to lose your ember at the start, and since you often don't have enough time to light and rest at a bonfire, that's often a suicide run, and that strategy gets repetitive and boring.From when I found this strategy late game to ng+ to my second character, just running will allow you to skip most of the difficult sections throughout the entire game. I still have trouble beating the winged knight at the start of the game, but I never had to learn because the first time I could just safely kill him with a bow and he couldn't fight back, and the second I just ran past him and made some return suicide runs to get all the nearby items. The iframes on animations means you never have to clear out a room to move on, so you never have to git gud until a boss.Second, levels never loop back into a previous level. If you go one direction, you will often be going down a linear path to either the next objective or a piece of loot. It lacks Dark Souls's interconnected levels, which made all of them feel more memorable. Dark Souls III has II's overworld map, but with each location being as well designed as the first. Its better than II, but the first is a lot more interesting.Also, its missing, as Yahtzee put it, Metriodvania level progression. You only really have two directions you can go at any given point, and both of them are mandatory. There's a way to get into the final area of the game in the first level, but since its blocked by a late game boss its more for new game + players than anything. Even then you have to go the normal direction eventually, so its not a good speedrunning tactic, and you can't suicide run a high leve area to get some good loot early on. Ignoring that example, at every point in the game it goes linear, then you get to a point where there's exactly 2 path to take, before going back to being linear. For those of you who have played the game / don't care about being spoiled, linear from the start until road of sacrifices, then you have the path of Crystal Sage -> Deacons of the Deep and Abyss Watchers -> High Lord Wolnir, linear for a short time again until the distant manor bonfire, then Pontiff Sulyvahn -> Aldrich and irithyll dungeon -> profaned capital, then when you're supposed to unlock the final area, its linear to the end. You can't even do your first optional area until you're at the final level, and all but one of the optional bosses are in those areas. Simply put, I want the option to sequence break / skip certain bosses and areas, and do them in a seperate order. Even if they won't be used often, or if I'll have to go back anyways, its always nice to at least have the option. I like being able to skip to the final section of the game right at the start, but there's simply not enough of that throughout the game.While the tutorial is good, and gives the basics, the things it leaves out are vital to know. First, they kept the Dark Souls II two handing of pressing or holding to chose which hand to use, something I didn't understand coming from Dark Souls and the simple message of ""press y"" didn't make me understand there was a second version, until I tried Dark Souls II and learnt it there. Second, the iframes on rolls. This is a huge one, since many bosses require that you roll through attacks. The huge amount of iframes made me realize I was basically untouchable if I could time my roll to the boss's attack. Then, there's poise. I understand having things be cryptic from a lore perspective, but hiding a mechanic is too muchThere's naturally a fair share of bad bosses along with the great bosses. The dragon boss is an asylum demon copy (the first level copy of running away and coming back for a plunging attack, only now its a 1hko), the deacons mob boss is boring and easy, and Wolnir is a dps test, who can be impossible to kill if you don't do enough damage and the rng has him spamming fog.Co-op breaks the bosses. Bosses are at Bloodborne's speed, and having anyone to take the aggro off you means you can alternate free heals. Plus everyone gets a ton of estus to spam, so you only lose if you die in a combo or trekked the entire level beforehand.One of the changes I personally love, however, is the shortened run back to a boss. It might be a grueling trip to the boss the first time if you stop to kill all the enemies along the way, but usually after reaching it once you can unlock a shortcut that skips all the enemies. Sometimes I feel they go a little overkill with it though; my prime examples are in the last area, where the two bosses have a short gauntlet of foes before the boss, which should create a scenario forcing the player to take risks. The option should be fighting all the enemies, costing precious estus, or ember before the run to drop a quick summon, risking losing it to the enemies or getting a summon failed after entering the boss fog. However, there's a lift before both fights, right after unlocking a shortcut right before it. The final and hidden final bosses don't even have a run of any sort; there's a bonfire right before the boss. The only one without this is untended grave, since they remove the bonfire. I view this as a positive change, since with most of the bosses being well balanced, it will probably take most players a few tries to learn the pattern. I disliked this game because I beat it easily, and never had to git gud. There's no penalty for using the optimal strategies I did, and co-op is overpowered. Phantom estus needs a nerf, and enemies should block your path more often.",0
Negative,"Recommend this on Console, but not on PC unless you have a Steam controller, or your happy to fix the prompts through mods and play offline.PS4 Dark Souls 3 = AwesomePC Dark Souls 3 = Bad PortThe game itself is amazing with a variety of cool bosses and an experience you will never forget.Lots of pain but a huge sense of accomplishment when your patience and persistence pays off.The reason why I gave this a negative review is beacuse; - My PS4 controller wont work properly, - The port is bad and, - No Mouse & Keyboard promtps even though as this is on the PC. which sucks. Secondly Modding is banned online, some texture mods seems to be fine for some people but not for others, maybe it's the way they have them installed? But non texture mods are a definite no online which I can understand. So if you want to use either the PS4 Prompts or Keyboard & Mouse Prompts mod, there's a chance you won't be able to play online with friends and a chance it might work fine. In the Steam discussions there's some people that can play with texture mods and others can't. Even friends using the same texture mod, one is fine, the other is not. Again maybe its how they installed it or how their computer is set up, idk though.Edit: They removed online and haven't replaced it with a local coop. But the biggest issue I have is that the game now crashes every 10 minutes. PS4 controller works but had to tweak some settings and I don't have any mods to change the button prompts so no idea why it's crashing.",0

Negative,They haven't done anything to convert this from an xbox game to a pc game. The buttons are all mixed up and camera sensitivity is so high it makes this game unplayable and I could not get a refund. Worst steam purchase I've made,0
Negative,"Nothing changed in DS3, since the debute of the Dark Souls franchise. It's still a grindfest with broken hitboxes, outdated graphics, horrible PC port quality (developers didn't even give an F about the control revamp - just let you guess what the X button stands for). Gameplay mechanics are cursory, more of a dance-roll simulator than a swordfighting experience. And the enemies themselves? Unresponsive meatbags that can take dozens of hits without even making a sound, specially the bosses. I'm not sure why is this called ""Hardcore"", because all you do is typically grind the boss to reveal all its attack patterns and moves, then come up with countering measure to beat it. That can not be called hardcore, but a mere exercise in patience.I've beaten up the first boss and this was an utterly boring battle of kiting and repeating the same moves over and over again until he fell dead. Then I uninstalled and refunded. Reiterating it one more time - for the practice makes perfect - the graphics and animations are incredibly outdated by multiple orders of magnitude compared to virtually any other game on the market, instantly crossing out the visual aspect of whatever this software is supposed to be.I gave the Dark Souls franchise whole 3 chances with each game, but it seems that it just wasn't the right approach.Dark Souls 3, like any other of its precursors, is a niche game for masochists or people of a very particular cast of mind, who enjoy dying a lot; because you practically can't defeat a boss without dying (to learn their move lists, of course), which is time consuming and tedious.Not recommended for purchase.",0
Negative,"The Souls franchise has a reputation as being hard, unforgiving, etc. Dark Souls 3 isn't challenging, it's needlessly difficult. It's not difficult because of clever encounters, great AI, or tricky resource management it's only hard because normal enemies hit hard. That's it. If you were to tone down mob damage, even a little bit, the game would be easy. That's not great design, it's lazy. Combine needlessly hard hitting enemies with very questionable hitboxes, lack of quality of life mechanics, a camera that frequently ends up inside large enemies or goes bonkers next to a wall, and you have a very frustrating game that doesn't feel rewarding when you succeed. My experience with the first boss, embodies my experience with the game as a whole. It seems pretty basic and straight forward, halfway through it sprouts an huge black gelatinous mass. After several attempts did I feel triumphant in my victory? No, I was shocked and underwhelmed, as I beat it almost completely blind as the black gooey monstrosity consumed my camera.I only had real difficulty with one boss, The Abyss Watchers. In my defense, this is my first Souls game, I was still learning much of the ins and outs at that point. Most bosses were fairly painless. That being said, the boss encounters were the highlight of the game. Bosses like the Deacons of the Deep, the Crystal Sage, The Twin Princes, and the Nameless King all stand out as very unique experiences. So it's somewhat disappointing that the game ends with a fairly generic boss fight.If you're a fan of the Soul franchise, I know what you're thinking: ""git gud"". You see this time and time again in the Souls community. Watching streams or Youtube videos make it apparent ""git gud"" means;- learn enemy positioning so you can run by them avoiding combat all together- when combat is necessary find a ledge, a doorway, any obstacle to get the enemy stuck on and exploit it- when it doubt, cheese with ranged weapons.I died more from weapons defaulting into single-handed wield than everything else in the game combined. I could not even begin to speculate how many times I charged at an enemy ready to attack with L1, only to stop dead in my tracks, buff my weapon inches from their face, and get punished. Why would the game not remember whether I single or two-handed a given weapon before I switched? If that's too tricky why is there not an ""always two hand"" option? Am I being too nit-picky? I could be. but then I think, what possible reason could there be to single hand a Bow & Arrow? DS3 is filled with many oddities like this. Dark Souls is praised because it ""doesn't hold your hand"", but it most certainly banks on you having prior knowledge from Souls games, or using Google. excessively. Would it kill the experience to offer a halfway decent description on such unfamiliar items like the Dried Finger, or a couple words on how Summoning Crystals work? I'm not asking to be whisked away mid gameplay to a floating floor in the sky so I can be directed to walk to a point and practice using a crystal. I'm asking for an extra sentence in the item description. From what I gather there's a lot of great lore. However, I just can't bring myself to be interested in the lore when there's no narrative. Apparently there are quests, but they don't feel much like quests. You explore a map, find an NPC, and talk to them until they start repeating themselves, occasionally you kill them.I found very little enjoyment in playing Dark Souls 3; The world is drab and brown, the style and design is generic, the story is non-existent, and the combat system is clunky. The hardest part of this game is finding the desire to play it.",0

Negative,"I bought this game on sale to play coop with a friend, but that is just impossible with the toxic community. We got ganked constantly by invading players that have more healing flasks, more variety of spells and weapons. This game is impossible to play coop for a new player.",0
Negative,"If you don't have a controller for this game and want to use keyboard, don't play this. Everything is ported from xbox making it difficult to figure out at what to do as all controls shown are for xbox. Wanting to play co-op however nothing makes any sense even after watching video's on it. This game isn't designed for pc and isn't any fun with a keyboard and mouse.",0
Negative,"I honestly don't see why this game or the franchise in general is held in such high regard. Maybe playing on a console would be a better experience for this (and the rest of the series), but there are so many technical things to complain about I don't know where to begin.Good: -Atmosphere, graphics (sorta), sound.Neutral:-No actual story to speak of. Yeah, yeah, I know there is a lot of lore. But you're picking up puzzle pieces and eventually saying ""well what do you know, turns out this thing is fleshed out after all."" If that's your style, cool. I found myself annoyed by this approach though.Bad:-Well known issues with framerate drops for an insanely inordinate amount of issues. Even if you have a super computer, you will likely find yourself running through a 20 page check-list to ensure you don't encounter stuttering due to some strange issue that only plagues this game. -Controller mapping is terrible. And that is another well known glitch that has never been addressed.Bottom-Line: I had more fun just reading through the wiki than playing a single title in this series. I will probably give the series a chance on console just to see if the technical issues are non-existent. But shit, as much as it pains me to say, for your own sanity and the sake of your monies, stay away from the entire series on PC.",0
Negative,Im gonna be honest if you are casual and dont have a gaming pc DONT get this game first the frame rate is trash if you dont have a good pc and two it can be pretty boring after a little bit but i havent even been anywhere close to beating it so my opinon in just for the starting part,0
Negative,bad game its the worst game fortnite is better,0
Negative,i wont play this game anymore cuz im sick of going the same route 10 times and not figure out what to do,0
Negative,"While this game is incredible by itself. I did finish it multiple of time with different type of weapon or style. Finishing it level 1 with a broken sword was the most challenging.I can't recommend it at the moment, since the multiplayer is down and doesn't seem to come back. It was a nice relaxing game for me and my buddy while drinking. People would invade us and being polite chucking their potion and waiting to see which of us go first.Now we can't enjoy a couple of item in the game and we can't play with friend. Helping random people while they were invade was fun and challenging.EDIT: They did fix the multiplayer, but it did take 7 month to fix it. Which actively reduced the online community. Naturally that happen at the launch of Elden ring, which is a pure coicidence.",0
Negative,Ok so I off the bat want to clarify that I don't recommend this game for certain players. Obviously from ratings this is in fact a good game. Just not a game for everybody. I am one of those people. If you don't do well with being patient and enjoying learning how to beat a enemy by dying a lot. Then don't get this game. I'm just one of those people who can't get how to play this game well. I really don't enjoy dying a bunch of times to figure out how to get past a part. Just gets too frustrating and not enough of enjoyment once I got it. Also the story is very vague as far as I've gotten and they do very little to introduce you to the workings of combat and managing your equipment and upgrading.,0
Negative,"A game that solely revolves around timing and knowing enemy movesets. It reminds me of cramming for spelling class in elementary school, except the only difference being; what you learn is non transferable to any other game, thus being completely useless in every regard. The gameplay itself is bland and uninituitve with no real way of aiming your attacks other than trying to line it up with A and D or lock onto an enemy and be forced to lose track of your surroundings. The camera controls are also quite bad to say the least. The game shoehorns you into a weird camera angle with unchangable FOV and mouse sensitivity. To add insult to injury, mouse inputs translate very poorly when panning and moving the camera around that gives the game an overall feel of being very janky and poorly designed.Ontop of everything aforementioned, the game also has very noticable and aging engine limitations makes it a poor excuse of a PC game, featuring a framerate cap of 60 that is directly tied to physics simulation which cannot be remedied even with mods.I also find it quite hilarious and pathetic that the entire tutorial is written in controller layout with no kb/m translation to be found anywhere, i.e. use your right bumper to perform x action etc. I don't know whether that is due to bad planning or the sheer lack of due diligence when designing the game, but that hardly matters at this point.Thank god I've only paid $10 on G2A for this game, it's a waste of time at best.",0

Negative,"I believe that games should contain hard quests and puzzles to solve. But facing hard bosses is something, and being unable to use some very simple game mechanics is another. Just google how many people are searching for clues for only how to (kick) or even (jump) in Dark Souls 3. Even the hard bosses you have, beating them requires spamming rolling behind them, and hitting them in the back. It's very hard, but doesn't require any high intelligence. It's stupidly hard. It's a waste of time.",0
Negative,"It's a pretty fun game overall. I miss the monster/boss drops from DS1. Combat is a tad more fast paced wich is good and bad. Weapon skills and mana are immensely useful. Now I can play a mage without feeling like I am cheating. It has its problems, sure, (such as dual weapons becoming obsolete in later playthroughs) but overall it's pretty good; a solid 7/10.The reason I am giving it a negative review is the anti-cheat program they use. I am one of the many who got soft banned, despite never using a hack or editor. All of my characters and items are legitimate, yet I am still banned. As it turns out, almost anything (including controller drivers) can get you banned. In my case, I think the cause was a me backing up a save. My HDD is dying (and there is no cloud) and I wanted to make sure it would work, so I tested it out. You get a warning telling you to stop using the characters who are in violation of the rules, but even if you delete everything like I did and start fresh it doesn't help. So if you never use almost any 3rd party programs, even things like FRAPS, and don't mind not being able to back up your data for any reason, then the game is fine. This could be remedied by allowing us the ability to host our own servers so online play with friends and others is still possible (even after the shut down the official servers like the did with DS1). If any of this BS changes, I will happily change my review.",0

Negative,"Got banned w/o warning for downloading the DLC content 2 weeks after buying the game. First souls game and i didn't even finish it because i get penilized for buying the dlc now can't play with friends.

Negative,"THIS REVIEW IS NOT RELEVANT IF YOU ARE PLAYING SOLO.I'm sure this would be a great game. IF I could actually join the one person whom I want to play whis game with. I know, I know, you can. But it feels incredibly tedious. Great game. Kinda tedious matchmaking. I bought this game on another website, that gets censored if I type it, as I'm poor and couldn't afford Steam's price, therefore I can not refund *wipes tear from cheek*. I feel robbed of money. In addition, the PC controls are somewhat derpy, nothing game breaking (could just use a controller). Recommended for those of you solo players. I will say that the matchmaking isn't awful, it makes sense. But I don't want to spend more time summoning my friend than fighting bosses. I don't recommend the game, only because I'm a salty potato. I hope you enjoy if you do purchase <3.",0
Negative,"This game has pretty serious issues. Nearing a year since release, and it will still randomly freeze and lock up your computer. This problem has been known since release and there is still no official communication to indicate any sorts of steps are being taken to fix this. Im running it on a 1070 gpu, 6600k cpu, 16 gb ddr4 3000 ram and from a nvme drive. And even after turning everything down to low, it will freeze up randomly after killing monsters, sometimes just by running around, when leaving a bonfire and when loading into an area. I have tried having it installed on a normal ssd. Increasing virtual memory to 5x the normal. Downgrading drivers, using beta drivers, disabling steam overlay.Also, i even did a complete reformat of my computer and tried having just dark souls and steam+ drivers on it. Still get the random freezes. Unfortunately, I got the game from humble store, so i cant refund it. The game is broken, and a very bad console port to pc.",0

Negative,"I wasnt into getting molested by a video game before now.EDIT: Nevermind upgraded to 21:9 and they dont have support and apparently that makes me a cheater . The game isnt difficult , not getting banned for stupid reasons is . Nvm the recommend ive had before.",0
Negative,"Okay so this is the 5th souls game I've played and it's fun just like every other one, the only one I didn't fully enjoy so far was Bloodborne with the excessive grinding which didn't feel justified at all but the game itself had probably the best fights in the series. I don't even wanna go into details of why all these games are good cause y'all probably already know how good the series is, I'm here to complain.The co-op sucks, not only on this game but on every game in the series, I know the game isn't designed to be co-op and I wouldn't even complain about it BUT the networking is already implemented and it's pretty good, so the co-op sucking is just a design flaw that feels like so much lost potential. Sure you can just play the whole game twice and have a somewhat decent to mid co-op experience but damn it'd be so easy to have a bit of quality of life in there, y'know? Sadly the only access to it is thru mods which for this game in particular have a warning about a potential ban, splendid, I just got into the game and if I want to actually play some co-op I have to risk getting banned, I don't even understand the game's online system enough yet to know the consequences but damn this could all been avoided by a little bit of better design.In Elden Ring the co-op mod we played was absolute fire, it made everything work so well and seamless and it just makes me feel that it's not justified for it to be this bad by default, difficulty scaling could even be customizable to increase boss hp, reduce their stagger on hit so you don't stun lock everything and so much more, with flexible rates so you can make it as hard as you want, multiplayer item loot, having to unlock things just once, I don't know man the potential is infinite with a game with such great gameplay and mechanics, normally the barrier is the networking/servers being terrible but they already work pretty well so I don't see the excuse. Why is the multiplayer so bad? No clue. I don't even want to get into how the invasions are so poorly balanced too that they don't feel fun at all, which sucks cause I absolutely love PvP but the minmaxing allowed as the main filter is just level to determine fairness in PvP makes it annoying if anything.I'll probably just play the game offline and I'll have lots of fun but you had the chance to make an incredible online co-op game for almost no effort and you decided to make the online experience terrible by design.",0
Negative,"I really tried to like this game, I really did and at just two hours over 600 hours played it can be said that I got my money's worth from this game. From all of that take my honest opinion, this is the worst game in the souls series. The pvp is bland and unbalanced, everyone can roll a nearly infinite amount of times and cannot be touched inbetween rolls, they can just use the bloodring if that isn't working out for them and be absolutely untouchable. Twink builds are more common for me than in the late days of the original dark souls, I encounter mulers and hackers way more often than is acceptable. With the new change to poise tpeople can just use exclusively r1s, stack poise and win. There are like 8 different weapon types and almost every one uses the same moveset as the leading weapon in its class just with worse stats, there are but a few exceptions to this, besides that there are almost no players who are playing to have fun, most all of them are there to win. The pve is the only good thing i can findd about this game, but that isn't free of garbage. It can be cool and breathtaking, really enjoyable for a while, but then you get slapped with move-queing at one point then unresponsive controlls at another. Certain bosses are a joke and others (particularly in the new $15 dlc) have too much health to be soloed. On top of all of this despite my computer being well over the recommended specs on release, the game still runs terribly. My game will turn from a perfect frame movie to a powerpoint slideshow mid-fight, in both pvp and pve. I honestly do not recommend this game. If you have played every souls game feel free, it's a fun experience for the first or second playthrough but after that it is just terrible if you are trying to have fun with it.Update: 100 hours later nothing has changed. In 1v1 duels the game turns into a slideshow, dropping more frames than is acceptable, the game has had it's final patch ffs. Pvp is still a mess, good luck if you try anything other than arena, pontiff area is so swamped with hackers that it killed my second wind with the game. My llast session, roughly 4 hours, 8 hackers. Ridiculous. This remains to be the easiest, and buggiest in general controls and gameplay, in the series. A shining turd on the top of the heap. Uninstalled for good, final hours on the game: 674, with probably a third of that being pleasant.",0
Negative,"Edit as of 4/17/2022Bring the servers back or this will stay Negative forever.Don't get me wrong, Dark Souls 1 through 3 are incredible games, but until they bring back online functionality, even as anti-piracy as I am, I recommend you just pirate the game. I encourage everyone else to change their reviews.",0
Negative,online play is broken for long time ! no conection at all shame!,0
Negative,fuck you dark souls,0
Negative,The co-op tag on this game is misleading. This game requires in-game items in order to sync up with your friends. and it also changes the experience so that random folks can join. I like playing hard games with friends. this game did not provide that co-op experience from the start. Be mindful of the 2 hour refund policy if you try the game. My friend played an hour extra longer than me and was not refunded by Steam.,0
Negative,"Very badly optimized for PC, even though I was using a controller, I had to use a mouse to look through inventory , and to change settings as the controller DID NOT RESPOND IN MENUS ! My controller was not being recognised in game at times also, so getting killed became a pain. I Decided to go keyboard & mouse and only got prompts for controller. Why the heck is using one control control system NOT enough?Ended up getting a refund.",0
Negative,"So many reasons to be dissapointed with this. It's a shame, too, because there were some fantastic moments which I will never forget, such as battling the Abyss Watchers.It's funny, I thought that the largest bosses would be the most fun, but they were always the most clunky, shitty hitbox bearing pieces of shit.At the end of the day, the experience is also just roll2win: the game.",0
Negative,"Dark Souls 3 unfortunately fell prey to being dumbed down for a wider audience. The game is much easier than its predecessors, and enemy variety is lackluster, with most bosses being a humanoid with a ""swing 3 times"" moveset. The game lacks in difficulty Sure, it looks nice, but it lost the essence of what Demon Souls and Dark Souls originally brought in. They attempted to bring back all the rose tinted feelings of previous games shamelessly as well, as the main hub is basically the Nexus, and there's another Anor Londo visit because.They fixed some of the glaring multiplayer issues from the previous games, which is appreciated, though modders can still cause other players to be banned from online play entirely. That's not a good system. The PvP is also still jank due to stamina not being an issue, and animations being as non-committal as possible, because they wanted to rake in as many people as possible.It's a shame because the few improvements that actually benefit the series are overshadowed by the design choices. Season passes are also a disgusting practice.",0
Negative,"This game doesn't need another like. It is what it is. I hate getting invaded all the time and I hate how the design team created a game where playing with your friends is a bad thing. It's not like it's fair either. Invaders find the best weapons and gear and when they're about to loose they run into a group of mobs that's sure to give them the advantage (I know there's a seed that makes mobs attack an invader but it's a hassle to get and invaders can still have superior weapons/armor). The invader gets the best reward too, whereas killing an invader hardly yields any benefit. The game is amazing, don't get me wrong but with the balance of the game encouraging invasion, it's too frustrating. The game is hard enough without having a 30 minute standstill while the invader keeps running away. It takes a lot of fun out of an otherwise great game.",0
Negative,"The game might be very good, but I've never seen such a poor port to the PC. The tutorial gives you the playstation buttons, then you have to look up what key they actually mean in the keybinding menu, etc. Even then, it's very counterintuitive in many ways. Don't get this for PC.",0
Negative,"So by now everybody probably knows that Dark Souls 3 is not a bad game. However, I feel like it made many bad game design decisions. For instance, why in the world do I need to walk back 2 minutes to every boss when I get killed. This game revolves around dying and trying again, so why would you encumber the player with something useless and time consuming like that. You're supposed to run past the enemies anyway, so there's zero challenge there and takes away immersion as well.Furthermore, the currency/leveling system. You can ""farm"" souls from NPC's that respawn and level up as far as you want. Why? Isn't this game supposed to be challenging? I found myself deliberately NOT leveling up or collecting souls, because that would undermine the challenge and accomplishment of the game.Then, there's almost zero lore. I don't care what the wikipage says on it. It should be in the game. Not a singe boss gets ANY kind of introduction or bit of story. You're just fighting big things and have no idea why. Just a lack of the story-component of a game. Then, the combat. There seems to be a delay between the input and an action (including rolling), and since many enemy attacks are faster than that delay, there's literally no way to avoid getting hit without knowing exactly at what point the animation will do an attack (which some people see as a challenge, but is just memorisation). The camera can get really annoying too. When locked-on you often can't even see the upper body of the enemy (because they're so big and the FOV is so narrow), so you can barely make out the animations. A lot of bosses just boil down to ""poke them in the ass"" as well. Also attacks go through walls. Furthermore, what's the point of stamina really? Is ""resource management"" really a challenging and exciting mechanic?There's no ambient music and some of the boss music is just obnoxious. Though the main theme and some others (Abyss Watchers) is quite nice.There are many fps drops as well.All that said, I think all the environments are really beautiful and I love the gothic fantasy vibe. Armor, weapons, spells and enemies look cool. I'm glad games like DS3 exist, but I just disagree with some things in it.",0
Negative,"This game is amazing, and a must for fans of Souls/Elden Ring. However, they took the servers down as far as we can tell forever, and removed all mention of online play in the store. This is pretty shady. CyberPunk shady.",0

Negative,I can play Witcher 3 on med-high settings at 35 fps on my current card. I have everything on low in this game and I still get as low as 15 fps in lots of areas. Thankfully I've only crashed once. I know lots of other people crash all the time. At the time of writing this review. FromSoft hasn't done anything to fix this games terrible optimization. I run into enemys all the time that seem to still be able to hit me in mid roll. It's much worse in pvp. I've still managed to beat this game and all of the bosses. I honestly am done playing until this game is fixed. The fact that I was able to still beat it is amazing. I'll be watching for updates. Hopefully they come sooner rather than later.,0
Negative,"Whoever finds it fun to invade other players who casually play this game for a few hours a week tops are TRULY the armpit of the earth. I don't want to ""GiT gUd"", I want to enjoy playing the game. The game is just about unplayable by yourself and then when you get your friends to come and help you out, you're invaded by some guy sitting by himself in his parents basement while he taunts you and ruins your game. He taunts you in the game when in reality he's too scared to even talk to his 6/10 cousin without sweating or stuttering. As south park would put it, I'll refer to these players who invade as ""he who has no life."" IF this game had a feature where you could play with your friends without having to worry about ""he who has no life"" invading your game, maybe I would recommend this game to others. Since there doesn't see to be a "" sword of a thousand truths"" in the game or should i say ""art"", this game is the most frustrating game to play if you enjoy frustrating yourself and screaming obscenities at your screen while your cats run and cower in a corner, then this is the game for you!",0

Negative,"i get what the hype is about but its really just a poorly put together game. maybe it's better on console with less glitches. The sad excuse for a story is one thing but its the bad combat mechanics that bother me, so i'll just list them off.-sometimes while fighting the camera does a dramatic change like you are about to see something cool but then it just zooms in on your face. you cant stop it until its done, so hopefully you already killed who you were fighting.-the camera is unable to move every time after hitting an enemy, unless you put a movement command in. So you cant just turn the camera sometimes which is huge in this game.-enemies frequently get stuck in the terrain and are unable to be hit but can hit you all day.-not all hit boxes are correct for attack animations-all in game commands are for the controller, so you spend a lot of time just trying to figure out what button does what on a keyboard. - literally nothing gets broken down or explained in this game. it gives so many combat numbers but not the important ones. If you want to see the dmg from your FP using special attacks, you have to google it. want to know wtf unfaltering prayer does, you better google it. you want to know how much poise your specific unfaltering prayer gives, google it. want to see a spell's ratio to your spell buff? google it. get the idea? its just laziness. Its super inconvenient to google everything when the game should just tell you the numbers to begin with. I'm a numbers guy, so this really bothers me more than anything else in item based game.- if it wasnt $60 i would understand all the problems with the game. but the basically made a pretty decent combat game, gave it a camera from the PS2 days, put some of their numbers together for you to see, explained nothing, and called it a hard game.- tired of the camera staring at my guys face, the wall, or straight down because i used the lock on.",0

Negative,"I just finished the game and wanted to say that yes, this IS the best Dark Souls game, and I've played all of them.That said, I'm keeping this review with a thumbs-down until the following is done by the publisher, Namco Bandai:- Stop banning non-cheaters and allow cheaters to keep playing.- Allow for Cloud saves so that players don't have to back-up their game on their own, which might save them from corrupted data (courtesy of said cheaters).- Write patch notes in clear ways that explain what EXACTLY is being changed instead of making the player base do experiments on their own in order to figure out the new ""balance"" patch.- Take care of its players' problems by responding within a reasonable time period (i.e. less than two weeks).- Admit that ""poise"", an important game mechanic, is NOT working, and shouldn't be displayed in the game because, well, it's misleading.",0
Negative,"Almost everyone is experiencing crashes, framerate issues (5 -10 fps) and poor performance.Even people with 980's and overkill hardware have issues. There's a huge problem with this games optimization.People crash at bonfires (your savepoint) which is ridiculous, some have even lost their save game entirely.The gameplay is good and atmosphere is there, but the game isn't stable, it's unplayable.The steam community hub is flooded with over 1000 cries for help because the game doesn't work.Another 1000 posts on Reddit by people looking for performance fixes, multiple threads on /v/, neogaf, gamefaq etc. Every PC game at launch has issues but it's fair to say this hasn't been a smooth PC launch considering the sheer amount of problems. People with high end systems struggle to run the game/suffer from crashes, so the problem is the game itself. I'm one of the lucky few who can play the game, but even then I had to spend hours doing work arounds and tweaking settings until the game worked.Don't buy this game until they update and fix the problems, there's far too many to overlook even for the most loyal of souls fans. (Don't trust some of the positive steam reviews, one of the top rated ones was by a guy who only played the ps4 version. Don't be fooled by blind fanboys or video game journalists who barely even played the game)",0
Negative,stupid fucking questlines,0
Negative,PVP is straight trash. if you enjoy pvp don't buy this unbalanced piece of shit. if you like to 3or 4v1 all fucking day long then go ahead and try this out since this is the only form of pvp you will get. fuckin literal 2/10PVE is fantastic however.,0

Negative,"game is ment for people with no life. I played the game story twice now.its a cool story but the game play/ leve design lets it down.you must do hours of research to do anything in the game. amor dosent matter so enemy will allways take chunks of life away. even rats a low leve enemy.WTF? enemy will stun lock you but you cant them.also some times your hits wont register even when you clearly hit them, had this happen when I was farming.A lot of weapons are copy pasted reskins of one another even down to weapon art.Playing pvp is a mix bag due to laging.overall get the game on sale for around 10-20$ play story and drop it since thats all thats good.",0
Negative,"This game touts itself as a very difficult game that can be mastered. However, this is more of a test of patience with bad design and technical issues.The good portions can be seen through the PC techical issues. The enemies are hard and, when the framerates cooperate, it can be quite fun to learn their attack and finally take down a hard armored enemie. The loot is about standard and, from what I can tell, there is a decent system in place that allows experimentation.Then comes the issues. The camera design is very much for a controller. Even with a controller, it is terrible. This is further exacerbated by the technical issues. The frame rate would randomly decrease in the middle of a fight, inevitably just as an enemy was winding up an attack. Then you would randomly loose lock, causing the camera to swing wildly and making it that much more difficult to even dodge/block.In the end, this just makes the game an excercise in patience as you see if you can challenge a particularly hard enemy blocking your path when the game isn't acting up. I would have loved a hard but rewarding game, but this is just cheap.I can definitely see a good game under these issues and maybe it is for the console players. However, for PC, this seems to be another Resident Evil 4 PC port.",0
Negative,"This game was literally designed to make you hate people in real life. The reason its called ""Dark Souls"" is because it actually manages to make you track down people in real life so you wanna kill them. Laggers, hackers, some fucker called Tarzan, you should only see this game as a singleplayer game. In the small time I've played this game's singleplayer, its actually really fucking good, like the atmosphere is amazing. Still I wantted to play because Co-op. But I think this multiplayer is actually a response to millions of people asking for co-op. The designers of this game purposely made it so if you wanna play co op with your friends, you'll be analed by asshole with 1012 hours despite being new to the game. If you're unlucky you'll see a dipshit in a top hat who whips you and shoots fire, and voice spams Japanese pornstar sounds; so dirty you'll feel ashamed that you've ever jacked off to AV Models.Rage/10",0
Negative,"Modders were* keeping this game alive since FromSh1tware decided to give up on all their past work (which is quite good in general, not considering DS2 ofc) in order to complete development for the most broken and hype failed game we now witness spreading all over, thinking they could somehow manage to craft a decent open world game that lives up to the name of all Souls saga. Not only they aren't capable of polishing their own product game after game repeating the same formula, they also invite a man who never finished his own stories in 10+ years to help designing a whole ""new"" world based on his all fucked up small minded (leak of) imagination AND they recycle like 90% of DS3 making it a ""new"" lame excuse for moneygrabbing. Genius, and I also congratulate those who were jebaited by their new ""gem"".If you never played any Souls game before, I'm sorry to say but don't bother paying for it anyhow nowadays - IT'S NOT WORTH IT. Ask if a friend can share their library instead so you can enjoy (?) roots soulslike experience while confirming every negative review going on from multiplayer issues that are never fixed to all deepest shit that never got any dev attention.Have no friends? Well, sounds bad. Wait for a critical sale then with discounts so high they can't pay for a single cup of coffee on their end.DS3 is an okay game for today's standards tho, great when running modded since it adds a huge replayability potential, even greater when you throw some challenges and overhauls in the mix. You'll be hardly bored or disappointed for a long time (unlike Elden Ring) but always keep in mind your journey may be surrounded by unbalanced and bugged shit alike.-* I say ""were"" because many active devs suspended their activities to check out how broken and shitty Elden Ring was gonna be so idk when they will return, IF they return. All their brilliant work still up for everyone at Nexus, of course.",0
Negative,sad excuse for a new game played both dark souls and honestly this just seems like a remake with a few new things added in and a new story i mean dont get me wrong i love the story but game play is still the same as always,0

Negative,"I really, really wanted to love this game. I've played every Souls game and DLC starting with Demon's Souls and enjoyed every minute of it. And I even started off loving Dark Souls 3; the environment is rich, the world is fascinating, and the combat is everything that previous games have taught me to expect. But then the bugs started showing up. Enemy attacks clip through walls. Enemies get stuck in the ground and still pursue and attack you. The targeting has a nasty tendency to choose the furthest of two options. And the design does little to help these issues. Enemies not only attack through walls, but also target through them. The game's difficulty is higher than in previous games, which I'd normally love, but that only makes things worse when compounded by the technical problems. I love this series, but I honestly have no motivation to finish this game.",0
Negative,"I would like to tell you more about the gameplay and world of DS3, but i can't. It crashes so often that i can't be asked to bother anymore. Crashes occured randomly, most likely when bonfires where involved. Graphic settings, especially lightning, on low help a great deal but there's still the chance that the game will randomly crash if visiting a bonfire. The issue mentioned above will eventually get fixed but was already known by the time review builds where out. I So, what did they do in the four weeks it has already been released in japan and the two months in which preview builds where out? Was the whole thing just to create coverage instead of creating a meaningful day one patch? I don't have any idea. But for me and many others, the game is barely playable.",0
Negative,"A soul is precisely what this game lacks.(and probably what some of it's diehard fans lack too)For real overrated doesn't even describe it,Even this being it's 3rd part it still has no moving mouths and endless vague monologues. Like a good friend of mine once said on this matter: ""it's a cheap way to makeup for the lack of story"".You really have to be either a drug addict or stuck with you head in the clouds in order to beable to appreciate that sort of thing because boy let me tell you, this one aint for the down-to-earth amongst us but let's move on to the combat:First you pick a difficulty/class the two are tied together where's Knight is easy and Deprived is hard and all the others are somewhere in between, then after that all you have to do is roll-dodge, attack, repeat oh and sometimes drink a potion when you made a mistake.Don't get me wrong the proper execution of this certainly is hard (yet not as hardcore as people claim).In fact the hardest ever-present bossfight is it's awkward camera angle, that's when this game's difficulty truly shines.Then there's the 'multiplayer' it's sad that it was so half-arsed for it is the only thing that made this game somewhat fun well at times. I guess it's random encounter pvp is there just to add another level of difficulty being matched against random tryhards out there whenether you where just about to save or turn in a quest or just prepping for the usual bossfight. People tend to call it a 'unique' pvp system but it's nowhere near as unique as it's especially unique co-op system: You require items to summon up to two or three friends where's 2 out of the 3 just get instant disconnected most of the time (doesn't refund the item btw) but in the rare occasions it does succeed (after the necessary retry or 6), you've got yourself a party in all colours of the rainbow out there. Now ofcourse there's a way to appear 'normal coloured' in a friend's game but that requires another item, same with the communication emotes by the way which is the epitome of uniqueness: You have to throw rocks at one another in order to say; ""hello, thank you, very good, I'm sorry"" I only got them very late after I finished the game already but that might've been just me. Wish I could've just had a chatbar honestly but yeah sure it's funny I'll give it that.Speaking of humour, the only likeable npc aside the onion knight who has produced the most interesting dialogue so far is probably the blacksmith that says slightly less incoherent stuff with an actual moving mouth! And with him having the only moving mouth in the game I had long suspected of being the secret final boss or somebody important, well more important then that lady that keeps telling you to 'touch the darkness inside her' atleast but ah well.Now I could go on for abit there (there's quite alot of points to still comment on) but as I've received this game as a gift from a friend I find it rude to stomp it any further. That's right I never would've gotten or played this game if it wasn't gifted to me, heck I'd be ashamed to have this shitty game in my library otherwise. Especially after witnessing how abysmal it's first game already was back on one of them consoles at the time.But for real I'll stop there, you see I'm not usually one for writing long ass reviews on a piece of scat but what can I say. the quarantine has hit me hard enough to waste some words on this shit-stain within my library. In short:Couldn't get enough out of it's previous parts already? Then go ahead by all means buy it, you probably won't be disappointed for this is exactly that very same game (roll-dodge to win + no moving mouths or coherent story included).New to Dark Souls and thinking of giving this 'RPG' a spin? I would really suggest to pass on this one. In all the time I was playing this lineair shizzle I kept thinking: ""Hey I could give Dragons Dogma another try, heck even Dragon Age. or some other RPG"" along the way I was even thinking of Namco's field expertise and conjuring up thoughts of giving their actual good games a try like Tekken. And after snarky comments like: ""You're just old!"" , ""you just don't like hard games"" I suddenly realized I started to miss games like (2D) Castlevania and Metroid or other games that are genuinely hard without the help of an awkward 3rd person camera and 'ring outs' in way too small fighting arenas (or oversized bosses, take a pick). You see I think this is one of those games that tried to be a little of each genre but came out pretty mediocre in each of these. So again don't go expecting a solid RPG, a fighter or a proper metroidvania because it aint.+it works with a mouse + keyboard (I've played the entire game with it due to the lack of a controller at the time and can safely say it is doable -ish)-it doesn't show which keys do what (yeah you have to figure out those yourself by trial and error but that's just extra gameplay right?)I was asked to give my personal opinion on the matter, take it for what it is.",0
Negative,"Dark Souls 1 had the best PVEDark Souls 2 had the best PVPDark Souls 3 has the best graphics.Do not play it if you plan to mainly PVP, you will not have fun. But i'll keep playing it anyways because I am a huge masochist with no self respect.",0

Negative,"I played most souls games on console an liked them so I wanted to give the PC version a try. But this PC port sucks hard. Cant even properly get though the character creation as only controller keys are shown and you can't click to confirm some changes. The mouse sensitivity settings are a joke, even on lowest settings its way to fast. Bought an hour ago an will uninstall it before even playing. What a waste of money.",0
Negative,"I hardly ever write reviews. I felt compelled to write one for this in the hopes of preventing someone from making a mistake in buying this game for PC. It's a console port, and it's the worst I've ever seen. There is literally NO support for keyboard/mouse. The tutorial doesn't explain keybinds, just controller buttons. You have to literally guess which keybinds correspond to which buttons. Some functions just don't have a keybind equivalent that I could find. If you manage to do figure out the controls, the character movement is still terrible with mouse/keyboard. It's clear they put zero effort into porting this over, yet are still charging $60 for it (I got it on sale). Do NOT buy this game on PC unless you are ok playing with a controller and are ok with supporting zero-effort-cash-grab PC ports. Literally unplayable with mouse/keyboard.",0
Negative,"So I have been trying to play this game but even with trying every single fps fix I could find online its impossible to get my framerate about 14. This just makes the game unplayable and quite honestly, it's the worst way to end a series on. I can't even give anyone who reads this an indepth view into the game when it comes to how well the game mechanics were etc because it was literally impossible to play at all.I have already contacted support twice (just sent the second email, they ignored me the first time). I don't recommend this game to anyone, it's clearly broken as a lot of people have this issue. If you haven't finished the game at least enough to make it playable, even so longer after it's release. just do everyone a favour and stop making games. This is a disgrace to the amazing series that is Dark Souls.",0
Negative,"Feels like playing QWOP wile fighting bosses. It only tells you how to use a controller, but there isn't anything telling you how to play on PC. You have to fight the camera the whole time and its hard to see whats going on. Don't buy unless its on sale, and even then i'd suggest against it. Its not worth $15 let alone $60. Great game idea, Great graphics, Bad mechanics. Reminds me of League of Legends",0
Negative,"I think that the best thing I can say about this game is that, the more I played it, the more I liked Dark Souls 1.DS2 was a disappointment, DS3 even more so.I keep reading about how good the combat mechanics is and I am absolutely baffled by this, the combat is pathetic, it is nothing more than spam rolling. People say that 'it's more polished', and I can only think that it's a polished turd.",0
Negative,"This game has a horrible UI. The UI is incredibly confusing, and if you want to play with a keyboard and mouse, well good luck, everything is labeled for a controller which is just lazy. There's also no way to customize your keybindings, and the entire process is made that much more frustrating by glitches in the UI that make things jump around in unexpected ways.",0
Negative,"There is a known bug with rolling-buffered-inputs that has not been fixed, Problems with connecting to friends online to play multiplayer. These two glaring issues ruin any enjoyjment of the game. Rip off",0
Negative,I thought they were kidding.,0
Negative,"I Platinumed this game on PS4. Overall, this game is quite simply a clunkfest where your character has the ability to do insane damage. But, in order to do that damage, you need to farm like crap. Overall, 4/10. I loved the Nameless King fight as well as the Champion Gundyr section of the game. Irithyl Dungeon (and to anyone who has been through that hell, I commend you on your dedication) was the most disappointing area of the whole game. In my opinion, Demon Souls is still the best souls game. Personally, I would rather pick up Sekiro or Bloodborne. Bloodborne is a faster, more aggressive take on Dark Souls. Sekiro is an amazing stray from the repetitive combat of Dark Souls or Bloodborne. I hope to get around to playing this game on PC, I just haven't had time.",0
Negative,"Yeah, i got ""penalised"" for having invalid data when i played the game despite not having done ANYTHING even remotely close to a glitch or hack, AT ALL, EVER!.fix your online systems, fromEdit: with the most recent patches i was un-penalised, and the game was balaanced very well, so i can honestly say, i love this game, and would recomend it, as the ban waves affecting innocent poeple have been stoppedanother edit:i spoke too soon. i was apparently softbanned once more for, again, NO REASON. im dont with this game. gonna go back to BB cause that game at least works, and dosn't ban you for no reasonone final edit: it's april 17 2018. i've been un-softbanned and re-softbanned twice more.if dark souls remastered has this same anticheat system i'm refunding it",0

If you're into that, cool, if you're not, not cool.That whole crash bug with the fire pits is the most idiotic thing in the world too. It's like if Super Mario Brothers crashed when you jumped on a Goomba. How do you not find that bug in quality testing? It's harder to avoid the bug than to stumble on it.If you haven't played the series before, get an earlier version. It's cheaper, and not much has changed.

Negative,camera is fucking abysmal,0
Negative,"This game has some of the strengths that made the original Dark Souls amazing, but ruins a lot of those strengths with its other flaws.This game lacks the slower paced, more strategic game play of either of its predecessors, trading that off for faster paced combat. Weather that is preferred or not by any player is entirely based upon them.For me, though, I don't have the reaction time required to do what this game asks of me. No matter how much I play or practice, I can't change the fact that I wasn't born with a reaction speed high enough to respond to the enemies in this game. I honestly think this game is amazing for people who have that talent - but If you don't, there's zero accommodation for you.Enemy attacks are barely telegraphed at all, and come out extremely quickly. With the removal of the poise mechanic, many alternative play styles have been removed as well. That means that where in the older games you could Taylor your build to your own strengths and weaknesses, you simply can't do that here.""Slow"" weapons attacks come out in less than a second. ""Fast"" weapon attacks are nearly instant. Quite frankly, this game isn't really anything like Dark Souls at all.The world is entirely linear - you can kiss the open, sprawling and beautifully crafted Lordran goodbye.Struggling through an area, hoping to god there's a checkpoint around the next corner? That's gone. Now there's a checkpoint around every bend. Sometimes twice, side by side.You can't go down your own path - there's a specific, set in stone route through this game that you can't deviate from whatsoever. there are some side areas, but as far as doing things in whatever order you want, that's gone.Just want to point out here - at the start of Dark Souls 1, imediatly from firelink shrine, there are more than 10 areas immediately accessible for you to explore. (The great hollow, undead burg, darkroot garden, the cavern of drakes, blighttown, demon ruins, New londo ruins, Ash lake and more.)This game gives you 1. And when you beat that 1 area, you get 1 more. And so on and so forth, until the game is over.Enemies scream at you. A lot. The enemy design is no longer story driven, lore rich immersive, but instead biological horror, and ear splitting screaming.Graphically, everything is brown and gray. There's hardly any color on anything. I don't know where this comes from - the game looks like mud. The OG game has bright, vibrant colors are areas, all the time. It was beautiful. that's gone.This game refrences the OG game constantly, like it knows its a masterpeice, but proceded to carry over nothing good from it. I don't understand why the devs of these games never even tried to make anything like the origional game ever again.DS2 was full of BS traps and instant kills, terrible hitboxes, ect. This game isn't even anything like either of those games.The sucess of this franchise saddens me, in a way, since I think DS1 is a true masterpiece of a game. I wish that another developer could make something similar without it being a ""souls clone"", and that completely diferent games like this, which have NOTHING to do with dark souls beyond the title alone, would not be considered a ""souls like"" game. Or even a souls game for that matter.All that defines this genre anymore is difficulty. And that's a huge loss.",0
Negative,"Very underwhelming game. With the amount of hype this game received, I thought I would finally buy it and get stuck in. I like the whole dark lore of it and the intro into the game is really neat. It really got me hyped up. But when the game started, I was met with clunky controls and movement, and subpar fighting mechanics. There isn't much of a story line to go along with it either so I felt like I was just playing another hack and slash game. The AI have no intelligence and there is not much in the way of strategising attacks. One thing I do appreciate is the level of difficult this game offers. You will die! All in all, it's just a basic hack and slash game that looks good, but just doesn't hold my attention.",0

Negative,"Dark Souls is punishing1. Start the game with zero info and end the game with almost none. Average players will require wiki to learn anything.2. Every enemy pretty much kills you when you first encounter it, then you're sent back to restart the whole area. Die again? Punished again. All enemies respawn as well, so you better hope you can beat that enemy which killed you or repeat again.3. Bosses are formulaic and require precise memorization to beat. You simply cannot go into the boss fights and win from skill, you MUST memorize. Some great players can, but the developer should empower the player to be able to win on the first try or at least learn then win shortly thereafter. Souls bosses like Nameless King and Pontiff have so many movesets that dying 10+ times is not just common but expected. Every boss attempt that fails requires you to slog through the entire area. You can't even enter the boss fight with full health because enemies can even kill you on the way there!5. The above punishment encourages running past enemies because all you want is to fight the boss again. Your punishment is to speedrun. What you want doesn't matter. Bad design!6. Enemies often lie in wait in key moments. For example, you see an enemy walking but his back is turned. You carefully sneak up but then 3 enemies fall on your head and stun gank you. So many times I died to those dogs in Irithyll that were at the top of the staircase where you could not see. Memory saves your life the second try, not skill.7. Enemy difficulty is artificial- they have ultra health and deal awful amounts of damage. If bosses were truly hard, then they would still be tough even if you and the boss did similar damage with similar health. No, Souls games stack odds against you. Dancer, for example- you can perfectly dodge every attack except the tail end of one spinning combo. you die. This is artificial. It's their bigger numbers vs your lesser numbers=difficult. Apparently, in the Souls fanbase this difficulty is acceptable and rewarding.8. Soulsborne series as a whole and the community encourage exploits. For example, in Bloodborne within the first 20 minutes you're forced to fight two werewolves blocking your path- Fextralife wiki states to lure them to a house where they get stuck in a door so you can just whale on them. Another example from wiki, Dark Souls 3 prior to the Road of Sacrifices an ice knight which few could beat, you will read to lure it to an elevator shaft where it will stupidly fall to its death. BAD. DESIGN. When this is considered good advice the game is seriously messed up. None of this was even patched.I could go on for another block paragraph but you get it. 128 hours of Dark Souls 3 and 110 hours of Bloodborne, I've learned I love it all for what it does right and overcome its glaring faults. This, plus memorization was required to fully enjoy the series. This should not be so.As for the game itself, it is clunky, full of bugs, camera issues get you killed hourly, crashing is common every 15-60 minutes, massive input lag, server lag (so awful when invaded by players as they skitter all over the place), poor hit detection which is both a cause of death to you but also something you can exploit, walls cause a stun on you if you are too close with a slashing weapon allowing enemies to combo you, stamina system creates undue hardship as you have to manage stamina as if it were just another health bar, shields do almost nothing forcing player to dodge which is not realistic combat for a game which fans praise as realistic.The list of bugs goes on. Most can be overcome, many will persist. So much in battle is considered, including bugs which increases difficulty even more. You will learn to remember not to swing near walls so in a hard fight you have to plan your dodges for better positioning to overcome this dreadful issue. That's my most hated issue.The deadliest enemy in the entire Soulsborne series of games is. the. freakin. CAMERA. It's maddening because every time you fight a boss you are always in a crowded area and the camera is physical so it goes crazy, even reversing direction or flat-out refusing to pan at all because of nearby clutter. A great example, in Bloodborne Gascoigne is in a graveyard and every single tombstone hits the camera causing the above. Cleric beast, you are on a small bridge with a hulking beast whose arms are so long it can swipe the entire width of the bridge and who is so tall locking on will cause you to lose sight of yourself. Yhorm the Giant will absolutely send the camera into a mental hospital. The delevopers are laughing at you.There are innumerable instances where hulking enemies are in tiny halls that you eventually realize this is intentional from the developers. It is not a 8ft tall knight with a sword either, it is an 8ft tall knight in a tiny hallway with a 20ft glaive, but does his weapon hit the walls. nope but yours does. How ab when an enemy getstuck in a wall, eas kill huh? Nope you cannot hit him but he will hit you.I am done! Rant over. I will likely play this game the rest of my life. Don't ask why. I'd rather not say anything good about it. Off to play more Souls and cut myself because that is how I get meh gost these days.P.S. The Souls series fanbase has regular ""Souls-bashing"" thread watchers. Just like every other forum and post that a newbie complains on, there will be 500 Souls fans on patrol to make him into a liar and a troll. Don't be fooled. These people patrol forums more than they play the game. Actual statistic shows only 10% of people who play Souls games ever finish, so they represent an extreme minority. Prepare for the trolling if you play this game then bash it.",0
Negative,"What do you do when your game is so badly polished graphics wise, it consumes way more out of a GPU than it should? Why it's simple! Increase the GPU minimum requirements from a GTX 465 to a GTX 750. And just my luck. I got so excited about DS3 coming out I didn't notice the changes they made for the minimum requirements just as the game got released. 85 and 40 frustrating hours later, I came to learn how refunds work! You can all guess how that worked out for me. Since I ""played"" over 2 hours and all.I lowered all my settings to minimum, kept fiddling with the resolution, downgrade graphics drivers. The game isn't playable for it keeps sending me to offline mode because of some fps drops every now and then.The game itself is fantastic.

To make matters worse, the game won't allow you to play in online mode with a low framerate. Your game session also terminates if your framerate falls too far. The entire UI is obviously designed for console users, and there isn't even a quit to desktop function. You have to exit from the main menu.Other than that, the game is itself is pretty fun. The difficulty is what you would expect, and the sword play is faster than Dark Souls II. I just can't recommend the game due to its bugginess. I shouldn't be getting drops like this on a 390x.",0

Negative,"Unfortunate i have to give everyone a big warning before buying the game. The game is not well optimised at least for the PC, and while the frame rate in enclosed areas is very stable, it will constantly stutter in open areas, from which the game will have many, since as the trailers show, you will even be able to ride on this big worldmap. Especially when a Boss makes a special move. Since Elden Ring is a game where you have to dodge/react to the opponents attacks in under a secound, this makes Bossfights frustrating beyond believe and honestly kinda unplayable at least in my eyes. I dont mind having to try a boss over and over because i make a mistake, but constantly dying, because the game freezes for 1 secound so i couldnt see which type of attack the boss is throwing at me is not the kind of challenge i am looking forward to. I hope that one of the first Patches will fix the horrible stutter problems that the game currently has, and i am really sure that once the problems are fixed, that the game will be absolutly amazing. But as for now, if you are still thinking if you should buy the game or not, i would highly recommend to wait for a while.",0
Negative,"As an avid souls-borne player, I really tried and gave this game my all. I wanted to like it so badly, but I can't bring myself to even complete a second play-through. This review will contain spoilers so I advise skipping this review unless you have thoroughly completed the game.Firstly, I'd like to start off with the great things this game does;Better Melee Variety: I love how there are different viable attacks when fighting with melee weapons, ashes of war (while some are quite busted), is a great mechanic to shake up monotonous melee combat. I love that charged strong attacks, and jumping attacks are not only viable, but some of the strongest attacks you can do. I love how shields can be altered and tweaked to match your build wonderfully, and how useful they feel when performing guard breaks.World Design & Aesthetics: This game, while being a souls-like, does an amazing job at separating itself from the look of the other souls games. The high-fantasy themes really show through in this games most beautiful areas. Even enemies and bosses themselves look amazing. This game easily has the best visuals, aesthetics, and design out of all of fromsoftwares current titles.Exploration, Sense of Scale, Level Design: This game feels massive with so many different things you can do, and so many enemies to fight. The legacy dungeons are all so fun to explore, and make for some of the most classic souls-borne gameplay.Now on to the cons I have with the game;Boss & Enemy Design: Truly the most upsetting thing about this game for me. The simplest way to sum up this issue is that it feels as if your character in Elden Ring is from Dark Souls 1, and the enemies are ported from Dark Souls 3. I really have no issues with bosses having never-ending combos of attacks, granted that I have the equal and opposite ability to properly react and evade. The combat in Elden Ring often feels challenging in the wrong way. Bosses more often than not have combos that never seem to end, and also an apparent fetish for aoe moves. I also find the bosses enjoy falling into a loop of repeating moves time and time again, spamming the same moves until your corpse is butchered to a pulp. My character ended the game with 60 Vitality, and it still felt like I never had enough hp. Armour seems to have little to no purpose, as I have to invest in endurance and sacrifice one trinket slot to have a dollar tree version of Havel's Ring in order to wear armour that feels no stronger than paper mache. The amount of repeated bosses in this game is really disheartening. After exploring catacomb #59 and finding the misbegotten warrior and another trash mob in an arena, the sense to explore is a fleeting feeling. It is tragic, and feels horribly lazy and under-cooked. No other fight drives this point home better than the Godskin Duo. If you've been playing the game to the highest extent, then you've fought these enemies multiple times: Caelid Tower, the Witches Village, Volcano Manor, etc. Already, you've seen these bosses far too many times to count. However, the creme de la creme is awaiting you at the Crumbling Faram Azura where you have to fight them for one last hurrah, both at the same time. This is an essential fight you need to do to beat the game. I really implore anyone that avidly enjoys this game, what was the purpose of putting this fight there? I find myself asking this question far often than I should when I encounter a reused boss in an area that didn't need a boss.It seems that a major strategy of Elden Ring is to avoid engaging with the boss, most if not every ""challenging"" boss follows this same logic. Fighting Radhan? Just hit him a couple times stage one then spam the summons second stage and never attack him directly. Fighting Melania? Just stun-lock her and use mimic tear to take aggro off you so when she uses her 1000 hit combo the fight just doesn't abruptly end. The list goes on with people listing ""just use bleed"", ""bloody slash"", ""use magic"", ""use x ash of war and spam it until they're dead"", ""use the rotten stray and proc scarlet rot"", ""insert exploit here"". None of these are proper solutions. Did you feel a sense of accomplishment when you bloody slashed the 27th boss to death? Did you feel satisfied when your mimic tear summon solo'ed the boss? Did you have fun watching scarlet rot tick down that boss you've been struggling to beat? You shouldn't have to re-spec to fight certain bosses, every fight should have viable solutions and a sense that every play-style has a chance to win. Whether that chance be low, or high, it should always feel possible, and it shouldn't feel like the odds are so stacked against you that you have to make do and essentially exploit the game to continue on.This entire game comes to a climax inside the Erd Tree, in easily the most disappointing final boss in all of souls. I still remember the first time I fought Gwyn, Gherman, and the Soul of Cinder. Each of these games built up their final fights so immensely well, it was a challenge I was overjoyed with. Walking through the fog gate into Gwyn's boss room is a feeling I will never feel again. The dread, knowing that everything that I've accomplished has come to this final moment, and when I win, I can finally fulfil the prophecy foretold to me. I felt nothing when I got to the Elden Beast. I felt no sense of accomplishment, no joy, no fear, no happiness. just nothing. It felt like nothing had led up to that point, there was no build-up, no emotion, no struggle, no sense of accomplishment. Just a gauntlet of two mediocre bosses back to back.I really tried to enjoy this game, I really did, but the boss design in this game really brings it down many pegs for me, and kills all replay-ability this game ever could have. If you enjoyed this game, I'm happy for you, but I just want to voice my feelings for others that may have felt the same way. If you didn't like the game, that's ok! If you did, I'm happy you enjoyed it and could see past the things I took issue with.Overall, as a souls-like, this game simply does not do it for me, and maybe others may share my feelings as well.",0
Negative,"Do not buy this game right now on PC, do not give them your money until they put in the effort to make a functioning PC port.I love FromSoft games, have for many years but the PC ports are always neglected. This time though not only a 60 FPS cap but also extremely poor performance and stuttering in fights, and very frequently in the open world. Sometimes they can last a second or longer becoming extremely frustrating. Walking around stuttering is frequent, my CPU is running at 4.8Ghz regularly on one core and yet and most of the other cores are sleeping, GPU usage is only 40% or so and I've tried lowering settings but to no avail. I have a Radeon 6800XT, 5900X, 32GB 3733 MT/s CL 16 RAM with an NVMe drive running the latest 22.2.3 drivers and it runs extremely well in other AAA titles. This level of performance is infuriating, and quite frankly makes the game unplayable. I will likely be refunding the game if this is not resolved soon. I'm not even the only one experiencing these issues, so I'm pretty sure it's not my hardware.https://m.twitch.tv/cohhcarnage/clip/NastyPrettyAlmondPipeHype-ih1OrBYVEOwP17N2Digital Foundry has done a full piece on some of these issues, which many people have much worse:",0

Negative,"I know many will handwave away any criticisms of this game as salt or reply with git gud, but as a fan of Fromsoft games since Demon s Souls, this game has felt like the most punitive and least satisfying of the games. While the setting is undoubtedly beautiful and there is a fascinating story and interesting characters, the design philosophy of this game is especially punishing. To put it mildly, this game feels as if the character has the moveset of Dark Souls 3 (with the additions of Counter guards and jumping attacks) while the enemies have the moveset of Bloodborne foes and the tracking of Sekiro enemies. Foes in this game are more punishing than ever with delayed attacks, enhanced tracking, and better AI. While this works, it feels like a bit too much in some instances. It feels like almost every enemy has some 2880-degree combo spin move, giant Area of Effect explosion, or some mix of both. In addition to these challenging attacks to deal with, enemy attacks are harder to read than ever, with many different combos having the same start-up or coming out incredibly fast. While this may be a product of the performance issues of the PC Port, some enemies feel as if they are fighting with a lag switch even if the game is not dropping frames or otherwise functioning normally. I have had numerous occasions where torrent your trusty steed will suddenly drop dead seemingly out of nowhere or instances where enemy health bars will strangely refill or moments where I will seemingly be dead angled by attacks hitting me head-on. These factors are compounded by the damage enemies can do. It is not uncommon to see some field bosses or more challenging opponents doing 900+ damage in an attack which is a death sentence for numerous characters, especially when these attacks are also fast swinging and usually accompanied by area of effect damage. Simultaneously the game feels very starved when it comes to runes. While numerous rune farming areas have been discovered, it is surprisingly disproportionate regarding difficulty and the number of runes enemies drop. Some of the easiest foes in the game that can easily be stunlocked and killed without difficulty will drop over 1000 runes. Meanwhile, literal giants that can, on occasion, pose a threat drop similar rates of runes. It feels bizarre and unrewarding to see genuinely challenging regular foes drop so few runes instead of the commonly farmed areas. Speaking of being unrewarding, while this is probably a personal problem, I do not feel accomplished from defeating bosses in this game. I remember the hype of beating Ornstein and Smough, Gehrman, Pontiff Sulyvahn, and Isshin, the Sword Saint. When I power through and defeat a challenging boss in Elden Ring, I feel annoyed. Despite some of these bosses taking all of my skill and ability to beat a boss in Elden Ring, I do not feel the same excitement I did in previous games. I do not feel like I have accomplished something. It just feels frustrating. I am not entirely sure what causes this, but the game does not feel rewarding. Still, I will continue to play, and I will beat it. Perhaps once that is done, I will update my review and give a final score. However, this has been the least enjoyable of the Fromsoft games I have played for now. If you personally enjoy it, that is great and more power to you, but I have found the game unrewarding, annoying, and far more draining than any previous games. Rather than being left with a sense of accomplishment after clearing any milestone in the game, I remain left with a feeling of annoyance as if I have completed a tiresome chore rather than an epic boss battle. Update: It is a shame I am not playing Salt and Sanctuary, for this review has been a lucrative salt mine.Update 2: It appears this review has gotten quite a few responses! Welcome! As mentioned before, I will finish this game. Sunk cost fallacy or not, I paid for it, and I am far too deep to refund it now. As of the writing of this update, I am currently a level 90 pure strength build (I abandoned my original level 60 character after feeling like I had hit a wall with a two-handed quality build). At the moment, this character has hit a bit of a wall with Commander Niall. If this information helps with your headcannon about me, you are welcome!Update 3/Final Thoughts: Now that I have become Elden Lord, I still stand by most of what I have said. While there are moments of the game I genuinely enjoy, bosses such as the Fire Giant and the Godskin Duo are pretty emblematic of this game's boss design and philosophy. Tedious, frustrating, and more of a chore than something that can give actual hype. While there are genuinely great bosses that can get one hyped up and good early open-world design that allows the player to roam around without being walled off, I think many of the bosses feel less like a test of skill and more like a war of attrition, a war that you can lose highly quickly. However, it is a war I ultimately won, a feat that, at the time of this being typed, .8% of players (on steam) have achieved. I abandoned my first character after over 20 hours of gameplay and managed to beat it at level 110 in a little over 34 hours after some experimenting. There are good elements of this game, the world is beautiful, the fashion souls are as great as ever, and the customization has been taken to the next level. At the same time, though, the boss design is, in my opinion, some of the worst it has ever been. Simultaneously, there are many reused bosses and enemies, even for a Fromsoft and/or open-world game. This has always been the case in Fromsoft games, but this goes beyond even the Dark Souls 2 Pursuer level of reuse. There is good here in the game and moments of hype and excitement. However, it feels especially punishing for certain builds and playstyles at the same time. You don't need to ""git gud"" to beat many of these bosses if you ask me. If you check in on any guide, the answer seems to be most of the time, you simply need to ""git bleed"" or perhaps ""git spells.""Update 4 (seamless co-op mod): Since I first played this game until now, Elden Ring has had several significant patches and quite a few changes (real ones will know the pain of 1.0 Radahn). However, with the advent of mods, especially the seamless co-op mod, the game is substantially more fun. The co-op has been a saving grace of many Souls games, not necessarily because of how it can make things easier but also the fun community shenanigans that can occur. While I still think that, on its own, this is probably the weakest entry in From s current line-up, the waves of patches that came in have made the game decisively better, and, furthermore, the seamless co-op mod has allowed something genuinely magical to come about. The game is substantially more fun and a lot more wondrous, in my opinion having a constant companion to play it with FAQ/Q&A: Did you try to adapt to Elden Ring mechanics?Yes! I used consumables, the mimic tear ashes (which is borderline mandatory in some bosses), jumping attacks, Torrent, followed the advice of seemingly everyone on the planet and got a bleed weapon, and I even dipped into faith to take a helpful incantation. These items can certainly make certain bosses more manageable especially bleeding. Since we are getting to the point where bosses regularly have over 25,000 HP, max HP damage feels more and more mandatory to make the game feel more playable. Will you continue to play the game?I might. I am thinking about maybe playing a character that focuses more on incantations or sorceries. I also desire to help struggling players against bosses I have beaten and be a friendly summon that can hopefully make their game less frustrating. To be honest, this is the only real grinding that I enjoy. No Maidens? I rushed through the game (from a story standpoint, not an exploration standpoint), so I did sacrifice her to become Elden Lord.",0
Negative,"I would give a mixed review if I could. Elden Ring has a lot of issues that could be a deal breaker depending on your preferences. I'll list the positives first and then the negatives.Positives:The story is quite good, if you're willing to put in the effort to read all item descriptions and carefully listen to all NPCs. The world itself looks fine depending on how good your PC is. The unique bosses are mostly fun to fight and the combat is as it always is in a Souls game. There s a variety of weapons and spells to use which gives a lot of choice in playstyle.Negatives:The largest issue with Elden Ring is also its main advertised feature: the open world. The open world is too large and there is too little to do there. There are so many open fields with just 3-4 crafting materials in it and nothing else that is worthwhile. It feels incredibly empty. Furthermore, there are way too many copypasted structures in the open world. Every church, every shack, every ruin is the exact same. The bosses in the open world are usually copypasted and you ll encounter the same bosses in multiple areas. Sometimes even a unique major boss is repeated in an area where it makes little sense. The open world also causes many issues with NPC questlines, which are harder to keep track of than ever and the use of a wiki is pretty much required to follow them. While the world does have a lot of dungeons and caves to find, these have many of their own issues. Anyone familiar with the Chalice Dungeons in Bloodborne will immediately recognize that the dungeons in Elden Ring are much the same. They are all copypasted and just not worth the time. There are around 4-5 unique dungeons which you ll then see repeated literally everywhere. It s so boring going through the same dungeons over and over again. The same enemies can be found in all dungeons as well. Mines will have the same miner enemies; catacombs have either skeletons or gargoyles. There s no variety at all. The boss at the end of the dungeons is copypasted and the same bosses can be found in different dungeons, just with health differences. The reward at the end is not worth the time in most cases either.This leads me to my next point, which is that the performance of this game is really bad. If you have an older CPU, be prepared to run into a ton of issues that are caused by the game not using the threads of the CPU properly. Invisible enemies, the world not loading correctly, bosses not appearing, these are all things that can happen because the optimization of the game is so bad. The online connectivity of Elden Ring is also incredibly poor. I played Dark Souls 3 on release and never experienced any of the problems that Elden Ring currently has. Playing co-op with more than one person will result in one of the summons randomly disconnecting very frequently. Playing co-op with one person is more manageable, but there will still be random connection errors, even during boss fights. The connection problems also affect invasions, with invaders randomly encountering connection errors. The last thing I want to mention are the current balance issues with sorceries (require intelligence) and incantations (require faith). Many powerful sorceries can be found from the very start of the game, making an intelligence build the easiest way to play from the early game onwards. Sorceries can easily deal twice as much damage as incantations. Good incantations can be found only in the late mid game to end game, and even then, they still aren t as good as sorceries. The early to mid game has around 5-6 sorcery-focused areas, while incantations have absolutely nothing until the late mid game. These balance problems could be solved down the road, but currently it really sucks that one build is clearly inherently better and easier than other builds.Conclusion:If you don t care about copypasted structures, enemies, and bosses then you might still enjoy Elden Ring. You should also forget about long co-op sessions or consistent invasions. However, for me these aspects ruin some of my enjoyment of the game and make me hesitant to recommend it.",0
Negative,"(Just to lay down my bonafides, since every negative review here is instantly spammed with 'git gud' or some cringe 2011-type beat: I've 100%ed every Dark Souls game. I've done speedruns, challenge runs, the whole lot. When I call things in Elden Ring hard, it is NOT for lack of experience.)Elden Ring has a lot of minor flaws (sparse armor early game, some jank w/ teleporting field bosses, boring crafting, boring catacombs, the hundreds of spirits and flowers I will NEVER use), but I can basically forgive all of those, because the game (at the start) is honestly incredible.However. about halfway through, the development budget totally falls out, and every area is now a ten-mile corridor full of enemies that can 2-shot you *alone*. The placement feels almost random at times, and it gets tilting fast. There is an entire lategame subcontinent with *three* graces. That means, if you die to any of the 2-shotting wolves or patrolling archer hordes, you have to cross the entire thing again. The two areas after that are nearly as bad, to the point that sprinting through is the only viable option.Once again, I can totally forgive some bad levels! Every game has some. but the larger bosses feel like pulling teeth.Trying to beat every shardbearer (major boss), you'll find at least two that are literally unplayable. One early game that is easily cheesable, Starscourge Radahn, and one lategame that is entirely unforgiveable, Malenia, Blade of Miquella. The latter has an attack that is almost entirely undodgeable, with a half-second tell that only helps if you're 30 feet away, and takes me from 1500 to 0 in a second. After all the shardbearers, you get the semifinal boss, a damage sponge who can 1 or 2-shot with every attack, who has an entire phase where every attack is a room-filling AOE, and who then phases into a grab machine that will instakill you with its comical grab hitboxes and 12-attack combos.If you can beat the AOE/Grab-machine, you get the honor of fighting the final boss. which has a fun-if-unfairish first phase, followed up by a ridiculous final phase full of camera-breaking nonsense and a very childlike idea of ""Cool Final Boss"", which singlehandedly ruined my belief that the writers had ANY plan for this endgame. Like, we had a cool final boss in phase one with Radagon, but they got swapped for ~the idea of the elden ring~ like a ridiculous Soul of Cinder parody. Once the comical, humiliating damage sponge is taken care of, you get your pick of ending! There are effectively two, with one obviously bad third choice where you literally burn the entire world, because why not, and overall, we leave with very little idea what any of this was about, what our ending choice even means for the world, or what we've really done in the first place. Yay! Game done! After 90 hours, I feel totally numb and ambivalent to this!There are a lot more things to talk about, like how finnicky quests become with an open world, but fuck. I think the worst thing I can say is that I spent all of Elden Ring planning new runs and build ideas, and now that I've beaten it. I just feel tired. and let down. (But the OST does 100% slap, and I do love Torrent, as well as a lot of the NPCs. 100% A+ for them, you can hug a woman, which is more than I can say about my love life)-EDIT: There is actually precisely ONE thing from the comments I'd like to add to this review. If you see anyone saying Elden Ring has 'six' endings, let me break them down for you.There is the basic ending. There is the true-ish ending. There is a bad ending. Then, there are three more endings. These are all the basic ending with a color filter over the cutscene and a single word of dialogue changed. Nothing new is added, and they amount to: Become god, become god but bad (grey), become god but VERY bad (red), and become god but catholic. These feel like extremely late additions, and they only highlight how vapid the difference in non-apocalyptic endings really is. They're meaningless enough that Elden Ring *basically* only has three endings.Also, I only learned after writing this that the game features a field boss who is literally the first shardbearer! The dude from all the trailers just. shows up in the field with a different name, and you fight him again. Elden Ring's copypasting problem is seriously everpresent, and I've not touched on it as much as it deserves, especially considering how mandatory catacombs are to the game. It's fun for one run, but by the second playthrough, I'd really prefer if spirit tuning components were just distributed throughout the fun parts of the game.",0

Negative,"I would recommend this game for most people, it is beautul and sad. Well Done. The gameplay however is much to one-sided especially for an older player, such as myself (77) and not allowing a easy play mode really limits the people who can really play and most of all ENJOY this game. Balance is also important it's a little daunting to have everything thrown at you in tunnels but, mainly just an easy mode would be nice for some of us older people. So as is I would not recommend this game for myself, but would for younger adults, who can remember every bosses moves and abilities Thank You for allowing me to express my opinion.",0
Negative,"Elden Ring on PC is a technical mess and I can't recommend it. The world, Bosses, and Core Gameplay look great but the issues are simply unacceptable for this age of gaming. A 60FPS cap in 2022 is ridiculous, And unfortunately even a stable 60 seems unachievable. With a Ryzen 5900x and a RTX 2080 I encountered FPS Drops, Stuttering, and a Unresponsive and frustrating to navigate menu. For some reason it Shows PlayStation Controller inputs with both my Xbox Controller and M&K. Don't bother Playing on M&K as it has some insane delay and acceleration that makes it unplayable. Also less important but should be mentioned: co-op in this game is awful. The need to use fingers to group up and then regroup whenever you do bosses or enter a dungeon. Progression in co-op is only for the host, so you have to run it for every party member in your group to not be locked out. I know this system is in Dark Souls but this is a new IP and having advertised co-op i expected a much better system. It's really disappointing it hasn't improved after all these years.",0
Negative,"I really really wanted to love that game. Got hundreds of hours in DS 1/2/3 and pre-ordered 2 copies of ER. Dark Souls open-world sounded like a dream come true. The biggest initial problem with Elden Ring is indeed the lack of adaptation of the Souls formula to the open world concept. This is essentially Dark Souls 3 with huge open spaces. FromSoft decided to apply its same old dying hostile world concept and the result is you soon realize this open world is nothing but stretched out Dark Souls levels with random mobs scattered around. Once the illusion is broken, it's impossible to unsee it, and you spend the remaining 3/4th of the game experiencing the open world as mostly a dash and run chore on your horse.Actual dungeons worthy of FromSoft's legacy confirm that game development companies cannot reinvent themselves at will. Stormveil and Leyndell Royal Capital are where the game truly shines. At last, FromSoft gets to display what they're actually great at: intricate, inter-connecting challenging level design. The problem is, you have dozens of hours of frantic horse riding and petty dungeons in between those. By the time you reach Haligtree and Farum Azula it's way too late in the game, especially after experiencing the lackluster endgame regions. The time spent on those should have been spent on fleshing out the first 2/3rds of the game.I'm not even sure what to say about the post-Capital areas, except it's obvious reviews would be really different if they were the starting ones. They are simply rushed and unfinished. Endgame in general makes you realize how rushed the game actually was and how it needed a year minimum to be somewhat close to what it aimed to achieve. Recycling of content is one of the banes of this game. You'll have pretty much met everything you will ever fight til the end before you reach mid-game, bosses included except for a few exceptions. This is another huge stepdown for FromSoft and another clear indication the game needed more development time. It doesn't just stand for enemies either: you will inevitably encounter the same graves and catacombs, churches, shacks and ruin models over and over again. This harms the entire premise of a believable living world immensely.The saddest part of all might be that even the gameplay is subpar to previous games. I can honestly not believe this isn't being brought up more by the Souls community. Input buffer is messed up and anything that isn't an attack doesn't register half of the time, resulting in your character just standing there after their animation recoveries. As a result you end up spamming inputs to make sure they register which is pretty much an insult to what used to be FromSoft's gameplay standards. The removal of the one button press to switch from 1handed to 2handed is also a huge downgrade and renders using the new 2 buttons combo virtually useless in battle as you have to wait for your character to recover from any animation before using it. There's a weapon swing combo limitation which renders your character unable to continually swing more than 4 times in a row even with stamina left over. All of this, coupled to the fact jump attacks become pretty much the only viable option to deal sufficient damage for melee builds, make up for a subpar FromSoft experience overall.Balancing is all over the place in every aspect. They clearly intended Elden Ring to depart from previous games by giving more options and versatility to players which would have been fine if they had actually followed by balancing the game for every build type like they always had so far. As it stands though, it feels like the game was tested and optimized solely on the basis of a handful of OP mechanics that make using anything else feel like self punishing. Melee veterans in particular will experience the strange feeling of playing an underperforming DS3 character against legions of the most beefed up enemies from the same game. PvP of course suffers even more from it with a handful of OP builds still reigning supreme 2 months after release. This again reinforces the feeling that the game needed more time to be fine tuned.Bosses are for the most part the least solid FromSoft have designed, ranging from too easy to broken hard by design. The game starts off nicely with Tree Sentinel and Margit but from Godrick and onwards, you realize bosses pretty much follow the same pattern of increasingly long stun locking combos followed by AoE attacks, except for the ones being straight up gimmick fights like Rykard. There are a few exceptions like the Fallingstar Beast that genuinely feels like a Souls boss. Pretty much all of those bosses of course get re-used several times throughout the game, even many of the major ones, paradoxically decreasing the game's scale of grandeur the more you expand it.And this is the end note you face as you near the end of the game. What seemed grand and full of possibilities when you started has shrunk in size the more you've played it, rehashed content after rehashed content, making you wish in the end it was smaller, shorter, but richer. I'll end on a special note on multiplayer. This is by far the worst experience me and my friends ever had playing a FromSoft game in that aspect. The constant disconnections, unjustified invisible gates, gating off of entire regions once random bosses are defeated and broken PvP made playing with friends a very unpleasant experience. There again, FromSoft should have adapted their decade old model to this new genre they decided to tackle, but they didn't. They slapped what was an already convoluted system on a completely new game concept and it works worse than ever. On top of it, the Dark Souls 1/2/3 servers are still down after months and might never come back, which is insult added to injury to their old fanbase.I won't touch too much on the PC performance as many others did but it is pretty bad indeed. It is also clearly bad optimization as the game is roughly DS3 with unremovable filters and the latter runs a lot better. The EAC anti-cheat bandaid they applied to ""fix"" the exploits discovered pre-release is for sure partly to blame. On top of it, it prevents you from installing any harmless mod if you want to keep playing online. So if like me Chromatic Aberration filters hurt your eyes tough luck because there's no official options to remove it.Finally, what a shame. The game is beautiful and full of ideas and potential. It would be unfair to not state it did take my breath away numerous times. I was actually ecstatic in my first 20 hours, but the feeling never stopped degrading after that, except when I reached the Capital, only to fall from even higher after it. Again, I really really wanted to love it and it was that close. The game needed more time, more development, more fine-tuning. As it stands, it is ultimately a mess if you look at it in it's entirety.I would have chosen something more neutral than ""Not Recommended"" if it was an option, but it's not. Obviously this review focuses on negative aspects as I feel those aren't shared enough. I think the game desperately needs criticism after the ridiculous ""Flawless 10/10"" official post release reviews. It's really not.",0
Negative,"Best summary for this game: the more you play it, the less you'll like it.Elden Ring starts off as a superb, engaging exploration of a wide world with many (fixed) encounters that you learn to navigate and overcome. But eventually, overcoming challenges only means finding one of the various cheesy weapons and spells available, and spamming the hell out of it. This issue overflows in PvP where despite a wealth of equipment available, you will always face off against opponents using the same few strategies. Because cheesing is encouraged by the core mechanics of the game, and doing anything else becomes increasingly drawn out and frustrating, you'll burn out and some point and start outright skipping normal PvE encounters because they aren't worth the time and resources they take you to defeat, and you just don't care anymore. I've played every ""Souls"" game before and, while each had a shitty level here and there, it never felt generalized like that.Elden Ring seems to be lacking this unique quality present in previous Souls game where you could do fairly well with any equipment that you felt comfortable with, both in PvE and PvP. It may be because some Ashes of War and spells are simply too good, too spammable in this game, while previously you mostly relied on basic attacks and movement no matter the weapon; special moves were there but didn't take center stage. Enemies didn't need to be so numerous and spongy, PvP didn't need to be a cheesefest; the few offending weapons were patched and many people who beat you were actually good and deserved it.I'm still gonna play Elden Ring for a while, but I think their design decisions are such that this drawn-out, cheese-to-win design is irreversible and won't be mended until their next game. It is because because I *know* that From Software can do better, that I am posting this negative review. Feel free to play and see for yourself!",0
Negative,"Erdtree update: Ill buy the expansion when they unlock ultrawide that has been here since the base game launched (as they just letterbox it - see original review section for details on that.)Updated review: I played the base game for about 5 more hours. I feel like they have fixed a lot of the networking (though have not played long enough to try more secluded locations)I am now playing under modded conditions. With the seamless co op mod, I can now direct connect to my son and now his friends whom have picked up the title. Just don't have invasions, while I have mixed feelings on this, as some jolly pvp can be fun. It's kinda refreshing to just know we can sit down for 2 hours, get into game, and just do what we wanna do and not have to struggle with getting wiped and resummoning. Because of seamless coop, I am able to fix ultrawide and it is glorious. Honestly, it was coded into the base game, you can tell once you play a while with it unlocked. I couldn't go back to 16:9. I am leaving this review as a thumbs down untill they unlock base game ultrawide support. It should not have to be modded to this extent. P.S. (as I have seen this argument before, adressed in comments as well) No, ultra wide is not PvP breaking. It's no different than using suround sound headsets to pinpoint your opponents location by sound. No amount of debate will change my opinion on this. Original review: Son got me the game for someone to play with, so I'm playing it. It's fine as a single player game. However the multiplayer system is so broken. About 75% of the time I get failed summons or people will get summoned into my game only to get disconnected near right away or shortly after. When they do get disconnected, it ""soft bricks"" my game. It makes it so I can't ride torrent any more (I hop on and then hop off right away) like the game thinks I'm still in co op. And then for some reason the game won't let me quit. It greys out my ""quit"" button on the menu. So I hard close out the game only to log in to it nagging me about not quiting properly. Every time I get that stupid message, I'm about ready to ""not quit properly"" forever.Then there is no ultra wide support. And because of EAC I can't fix it myself unless I play offline only. With how broken multiplayer is, I could just do that, however it defeats the purpose of trying to play with my son. (I have had the game load up for a good minute in 32:9 with vignetting, so it is programmed in the code to work with ultra wide screens, they just disabled it for some stupid reason. it was glorious for the short moment it worked.)I dunno if this next complaint is tied into my rant about multiplayer not working or not, but I personally feel the ""open world"" aspect hinders the game more than it helps it really. The world is so big that the players are so spread out that I see few to no summon signs near boss fights and dungeons. Could be a fault of the networking.When you finally do get the multiplayer to work, it has that dark souls magic that is really fun. But fighting most the time to scrape out some chunks of fun, ain't all that fun. Lol.Also due to the massive world size. Multiplayer should have been handled differently this time around. The sign system don't really cut it. 1. Stop dicking around with summon signs. It works in the more linear titles, but not this. Signs could remain as a system for picking up randos, however:2. Let us just connect directly with friends and literally hook into their world and play together. All players also need use of torrent as trecking this massive world on foot is a joke and ya just opt not to and play by yourselves. Also:3. Stop kicking friends back to their own game after a boss is defeated. With a project this scale and there being ""lesser world bosses"" after we beat something, we should be able to continue our treck to the next open world boss or next keep\castle. All it's doing is adding another attempt at summoning each other that will probably fail and soft brick the game again. It's just silly.It all just proves to me again to stop buying games at or near release. I literally have a 1 year policy where I don't touch any new games for atleast a year and Elden Ring was gonna be the same if my son had not bought me a copy.Now I'm near 100 hours in, my son has pretty much quit due to the fact we are rarely able to play together and I'm too invested to quit. So, here I am frustrated at a boss room writing this review as I look at 3 summon signs on the ground that I know when I activate them, they will fail.Sure do love this new world of games we have had the last decade or so where devs just release broken titles with intent to ""patch it later"" /sAnd no, it's not my internet. Every other game works like a champ, we are a 4 person household with over a dozen PCs, a hand full of tablets, phones, PS4\5s and Switches. You name it. We got 1000 down and 200 up with 10-50 ms Latency and any device that can be hardwired, is hardwired. Also rocking new MU-MIMO WiFi 6 mesh network. Basically my review needs a middle grey dash option. But since steam don't have that, I'm giving the big red thumbs down button til the matchmaking is fixedNetworking issues aside. I'd say it's a pretty decent title. Wait a year or more for patches or get a GOTY version with xpacs bundled in.",0
Negative,"First sections of this game were fun. Exploring both Limgrave and Liurnia was a joy and you could tell a lot of care was put into these zones. My enjoyment really started to fall off after these areas however as the problems of the open world and FROM trying to one-up themselves on difficulty started to become apparent. I had to go back and play the original Dark Souls a bit to make sure I wasn't crazy and wasn't simply tired out of the formula.A big draw of these games, the bosses, are simply unfun and tedious in Elden Ring. Here, FROM has given so, so many bosses combos that are way too long. Normally, this wouldn't be too big of a deal, however they can cancel their recovery often enough to add extra hits to the combo if they feel like it just to screw over your attempts to punish. Too often in ER I feel like I'm standing around waiting for the enemies to finish their epic chain combo before I can even maybe have a chance to land a hit in. Compared to the original Dark Souls where enemies had explicit combos they could pull off and gave the player time to punish and strike back.It is also entirely unforgivable how many times I've gotten to the end of a dungeon or catacomb only to fight the same half dozen or so bosses for the 4th time, only this time around there's two of them or there's accompanying minions. It's also exacerbated by the skyrim levels of copy-paste that every catacomb, mine, and cave have going on, they all look and feel identical to traverse.I'm 100 hours in and I still don't know what it means to be tarnished or to be Elden Lord. I don't know why I would even want to be Elden Lord. Meanwhile in Dark Souls, it's laid bare who you are and what your goals are. There, in the intro you're told you're the chosen undead destined to ring the awakening bells, link the flames, and save the age of fire. In ER, you're told nothing.Outside of the NPCs in Limgrave or Liurnia, they have a horrible habit of never telling you where they are going or what they expect of you. Upon completing a quest they will thank you and say they are continuing their journey and that's it. The open world design might ensure you never run into or see this character again as they are now hanging out in a zone you cleared and have no reason to return to.Overall, the game is interesting to see and explore for a while. But the open world has really worked against it and the combat just isn't fun anymore. Many enemies have such insane speed and long combos, they feel like they belong in a different game and it not fun standing around waiting for them to finish these moves just so you can have a chance e to play the game too.",0
Negative,"Elden Ring is a fantastic disappointment. No, this is not some review of someone new to the series asking for an easy mode in this game, neither is it a free outlet to bash on the PC problems this game had on launch. But instead, this is a genuine review from somebody who played all the previous games and has now completed this one. Also, someone who can appreciate that this game made a lot of good decisions, but also just as many or more bad ones. Unfortunately, I am not able to give this a mixed answer that is neither recommended nor not due to steams ""yes"" or ""no"" format. But I rather take the stance or approach that is ""This game is good, but."" Overall this is not a giant hate review on the game telling you that you should not buy it. Instead, if you are into SoulsBorne you should definitely try it and possibly develop an opposite opinion to mine which is fine. But I do indeed want it to be known that this game has its flaws past all the PC issues that hold it back from being a 10/10 masterpiece or just better than past souls games in my opinion. To name off the positives, the first 30-60 hours reminded me how much I love FromSoft games and the amount of fun I had back then on DS3, DS1, BB, and Sekiro. The first couple regions are great (with the exception of Florida) and so is the world along with the lore. Intriguing quest lines and characters as always from Miyazaki. I was extremely invested in Ranni's questline and her entire outlook and connection to the Erdtree and Demigods. Working under her along with Blaidd and Iji was probably the most connection I had with any characters throughout the game. Along with the plethora of cool weapons, Talismans, spells, and ashes of war, this game steps up its combat and options that make this game way more diverse than past titles. The armor is especially done well in this game as the presence of Fashion Souls is very much alive in this entry. Torrent is an amazing mount who in most cases makes horse combat really fun( Agheel fight especially) which is mostly hard to do in video games. The implementation of stealth and jumping was of course weird at first, but then quickly became natural and otherwise essential to some ways of this game's mechanics. The sheer curiosity and ability to find the underground worlds in this game and simply look in awe of the gorgeous regions of the Siofra River Well as well as Nokron City truly did make the discovery aspect of the game shine at the time.But on to the negatives. The last 20-40 hours of this game were probably the most tedious, frustrating, and annoying moments that I have felt in a Miyazaki game. For me, this decline started roughly after exploring Leyendell Capital and fighting Morgott. Both of which were probably my favorite boss fight and area. The game simply seems to lose its open-world value as you continue to find and fight through the same catacombs and caves with the same layouts and mobs for mediocre rewards and a summon that you're definitely not going use to over mimic. In most cases as well, these mini areas use the same bosses or a gank with 2 previous bosses you have already fought. I genuinely could not handle seeing the Crucible Knight for the 6th time as a boss or the Burial Watchdogs ( To which they just say fuck it and make them both trash mobs late game). It's not like ganks are impossible with amazing bosses like Demon Prince, Ornstein and Smough, and Abyss Watchers. But it's not even comparable with the gank fights in this game such as Godskin Duo, Valiant Gargoyles, and the lion with a sword for the second time paired up with the 4th crucible knight. Astel, a unique looking boss at first that is a part of Ranni's quest, shows up again in a cave during the late game just with a different name now and the same move set. It also doesn't help that the dragons as well are complete copies of each other, with the only thing making them different are their elements and 1 special attack. This adds more annoyance to the bosses as it makes the entire fight more of a chore rather than a new experience. It seems that the trade-off for the expansive open world was a more quantity over quality approach with the bosses which makes the game longer with more content, but makes a lot of the bosses easily forgettable compared to previous entries. In most open-world games these issues might be overlooked or forgiven, but with FromSoft games, we know from past experience( DS2) that this route usually is not the way to go.The jump from mid-game to late is absolutely insane. Bosses go from fair to absolutely crazy if you're not pumping in 40 points in Vig. The last 4 bosses consist of Sekiro tracking, 7-8 chain combos, and all of them have some sort of AoE attack that one shots and rarely gives you any openings. As a melee build even with the 40+ Vig, I still found myself getting 1-2 shot in late cause boss damages are so high. All of this is especially the case for a certain red haired late game boss who has an undodgeable one shot move and the health bar of an Ancient Dragon cause of life steal. Usually, I enjoy a boss being hard since that is the image and brand of FromSoft games, but it feels terrible relying on RNG, based on how many times she does the one shot move per attempt. I'm guessing some balances and difficulties were amped up based off players using summons, but for those of us who don't, we seem to be stuck in a weird spot to which the game is either too easy for some bosses or overly difficult in an unfun way for others. The 2 final bosses in this game in my opinion are underwhelming and I didn't feel all that much after defeating them. After the Whale ran away from me trying to make every attempt as long as possible, I had already lost interest as it felt more like a tedious chase rather than the climax of a game's final fight. Never have I felt so disconnected by a game that I have 100+ hours in. By this time I just wanted to finish it and move on so that I could truthfully review it with no biases. I genuinely feel like most reviews of the game or opinions of it are made up in the beginning/ early middle of the game to which I would completely agree with the good ratings at the time. But I simply cannot agree with anybody in good conscience who has finished this game calling it a 10/10 or GOTY. At most, in my opinion, this game is simply a 7/10. A decent open world game, but a weaker souls title that overstays its welcome. It's not terrible by any means with great atmosphere, story, weapons, armors, spells, and great bosses like Margott, Mohg, Makileth, and Rykard. But for the title that was supposed to take this series to next level, this game takes 1 step forward and 3 steps back.I truly do miss the adrenaline of dueling and learning bosses moves rather than an entire run ending in 1 hit if I'm not running a full hp strength build. I do want to eventually replay this game, but as of right now, it is simply an unbalanced mess between bosses and summons as well as a game that only has about 10 truly unique bosses( which is the lowest in the series) throughout its runtime. As of right now, I do know that I'm in the minority with this review, but I feel like once people start completing the game and are over the honeymoon phase they might lean towards my perspective on the game a bit more than right now. I truly want to see Elden Ring succeed but I am indeed a bit concern in the direction that FromSoft is going in. I do not wish to see them hear that they are making a perfect game and proceed to not fix any of the issues that are currently present.",0

Negative,"It doesn t matter what I think of Elden Ring.This game sold over 20 million copies in a year. In the era of games as live service, it demonstrated that an incredibly difficult single-player experience can be a blockbuster. It s Fromsoft's biggest hit and has cemented them as one of the most iconic developers of all time. The world has spoken - this game is great. The fact that I didn t like it very much is totally irrelevant. But I value honesty in review, and in this case being honest means going against the grain. That s kind of daunting as a reviewer - who among you is brave enough to critique the Mona Lisa, or Taylor Swift s latest album? These sorts of juggernauts are hard to approach, but I ve summoned up my courage, and I m ready to be a contrarian.My first complaint is the switch to open world. The Dark Souls games are a series of branching corridors, with paths opening or closing dynamically. There s a real sense of momentum pushing you forward from bonfire to bonfire, delving ever deeper into your own personal quest. It sets a mood both claustrophobic and expansive.Elden Ring, by contrast, feels too large. Simply following the critical path will get you maimed, so you re encouraged to spend a lot of time just wandering around the landscape. It s a beautiful landscape to be sure, but there s altogether too little happening in most of it. Liurnia in particular is a dull slog, but all of the areas suffer from a design that emphasizes scenery over a sense of flow.Speaking of a sense of flow, bosses also feel like a downgrade from previous titles. The core of the combat in these games is learning the attack patterns of your opponents. Starting with Sekiro, the design became a bit more meta ; as we predict the bosses, the designers predict us right back. Things like, to use examples from the game, a stomp attack having a little leg hitch to draw out the animation unexpectedly, or a sword swing that is actually a bluff for a downward slam.These little bait animations ruin the fun. Dark Souls felt good because the demon lifted his club to strike, you guessed the timing, and the demon missed you. Elden Ring, by contrast, will make the timing janky just to catch you. It moves the combat away from visual prediction and towards rote memorization, which lessens it. All of this could be easily forgiven if the story was gripping, and I was very optimistic on this front, considering George R.R Martin s involvement. Sadly, the story is garbage, told poorly - and you know this to be true, because you watched a Youtube video in order to understand it, rather than go through the torture of trying to learn the lore through gameplay. Understanding the story is hours of disjointed investigative work, struggling through side quests that become uncompletable at a slight breeze and reading item descriptions for insufferably vague context clues. If it wasn t for VaatiVidya and his ilk, we d all be completely lost - that s simply poor storytelling.It all felt like vague allusion for the sake of vague allusion. So much was left open to interpretation that the line between loose end and plot hole feels very blurred, which fundamentally weakens the narrative. Nobody s motives are explicable and thus nobody s motives are interesting. Elden Ring honestly just feels like a Dark Souls knock-off. One could argue that Bloodborne and Sekiro were the same, but to me, they felt like interesting and compelling innovations on the core mechanics established in Demon Souls. Elden Ring didn t innovate. It just slapped on a coat of paint, went open world, and called it a day. Souls became Grace, Lords of Cinder became Rune Bearers, and mechanics were almost entirely rehashed from old titles. Boring!Ultimately, none of my complaints are important. 20 million copies, remember? This review is going to get drowned out by positive reviews from people who had a great 150 hours with this game, and honestly, that s probably for the best. There s clearly something really special here that a lot of people love, and that should be celebrated. But as a FromSoft fan, as an RPG fan, and as a fan of challenging combat games in general, I was left disappointed by Elden Ring.",0
Negative,"Quick summary first I've played every game from Fromsoft starting with dark souls and I view BB as the best, I have roughly 1400 hours across the series and have done everything in this game. Elden Ring fails as a souls game and it is with this opinion I would not recommend, despite that it could be a great open-world game. it has fantastic visuals and the world is interesting (sometimes) but it has awful repetitive bosses, copy-pasted enemies with different coats of paint, zero direction for the player, a useless crafting system and unrewarding exploration.The story is easily missable as the exposition dump character only appears at certain graces and only if you notice the talk to her button appeared. I normally don't have an issue with the story in these games as the environment and item descriptions do the telling but not knowing why I need to become the Elden lord or how the world got the way it did kinda sapped my motivation which consisted of exploring and find a new thing. From what I can tell its the same thing as dark souls with fire being integral, big trees, and really boring naming convention (Eld, Erd, every name starts with a goddamn M. Seriously we have Marika, Mohg, Mohgwyn, Malenia, Melina, Miquela, Millicent, Miriel) and runes instead of souls.Not having a scooby where to go is par for the course with the series but is exponentially worse with the open-world as the graces only point towards the nearest lord, not the medallion you might need, some legacy dungeons are horrific Stormveil comes to mind, I couldn't imagine being a new player and experiencing that fresh hell as the game encourages you to go there first instead of the nice southern area to get +3 tears, having three secret areas within itself is some dumb design the consecrated snowfields, the Haligtree and the blood area can be missed despite the fact they each hold one of the lord bosses that drops a great rune.The reward for exploring is pitiful see that item behind the illusionary wall and protected by a hard mob? It's a crafting flower that has an infinite respawn area. You just killed a hard boss? Useless ash summon for you. 90% of the armour I had was farmed by enemies or bought from merchants.I honestly think dark souls 2 has a better enemy variety which was lambasted as ""dudes in armour"", in this game when I go to a different area it is the exact same knights and footsoldiers in different coloured armour and composition of allies. I get that some enemies have to be reused but seriously I should not see them in every area, oh and some reskinned mobs from previous games make a visit like the demi-humans are reskinned monkeys from Sekiro.The world looks phenomenal especially the underground environments like Nokron despite some goofy stuff that might be a reference but takes me out of it like the Nights Cavalry aka Nazgul, Godfrey Joestar, Blaidd who is literally guts.The crafting system brings nothing of value to the formula, I think I crafted one stack of arrows and an item discovery boost as arrows can be bought and are of better quality, buildup resist items were never necessary, firebombs and the myriad of variants were borderline useless as hitting the thing with a stick is quicker and less likely to get you punished for missing. Usable items only challenge runs should be more interesting now.The bosses are horrific, there are multiple slightly beefed up mobs with a health bar and name, gank fights happen too often to artificially pump up the difficulty, some bosses are too big for their arenas so you fight the camera (tree spirits suck), some can fly so high you can't see them so dragons consist of ""please dive bomb me, don't breathe fire"". Most unique bosses have fast high damage attacks, glue-like tracking, multiple distance closing attacks, most standard attacks have AOE effects (think twin princes overhead from DS3 or Lawrence from BB), some form of delayed attack like the nameless king. Now can you see the issue? Bosses went from most of the time playing on similar rules as the player as big weapon = long reach + big damage - slow even Bloodborne to a lesser extent understood this like Ludwig, AOE attacks used to be limited to 1 attack that had an easy tell, a fast backhand attack would do little damage but now borderline one taps even if you overleveled vigour. Not a single boss was enjoyable no memorable greats like O&S, Artorias, Gwyn, Maria or Friede, Gael, Soul of Cinder, Genchiro, Fume Knight, Ludwig. I went through this game praying for a good boss and the closest I got was Malenia who while fast and stupidly hard-hitting felt fair until she spammed one bs attack, killing her was pure luck that she never used that move. Every other souls game I looked forward to the next boss and learning the fight like a dance, now it was sheer dread as to what flavour of Lawrence will kill me this time? With Bloodborne being my favourite game high speed gameplay is what I love but this game suffers for it as you don't have the mobility to keep up with the bosses.Apparently, the optimisation is also rubbish worked fine with me but your mileage may vary.This game was not meant for solo players it was very clearly designed around co-op and spamming ash summons which goes against everything I knew about the series. I honestly do not want to play it again unlike the others where I was excited for NG+. Now because I went against the almighty Miyazaki I expect to see a shill in the comments hitting me with ""git gud"" or ""you have x hours how can you not recommend"" please do not disappoint me.",0

Negative,"Elden Ring is a good game. Perhaps the best game FromSoft has made, give or take Sekiro. There are a lot of people who are going to play it and love it. Unfortunately, there are also those who will read the ridiculous aggregate reviews-rife with some unseasonably lofty claims-and forget that this is, absolutely, a FromSoft game. I came into Elden Ring as someone who has never really enjoyed FromSoft games, hopeful that this would be the one that finally snags me. I mean, look at the reviews, right? Despite my distaste for the sub-genre, I've played and beaten each game at least once (for reasons more to do with social circles than aught else), so I feel like I have experienced enough of FromSoft's content to be well-versed in how each game flows. I was thus expecting Elden Ring and its open world to be the major shake-up the series' gameplay desperately needed (in my opinion).Sadly, this was not the case. Essentially, in place of an engaging, rich open world, I found a Dark Souls themepark; it's vast and overflowing with Dark Souls things you can do. Everywhere you look! Dark Souls! Under that rock. In that cave. Look at that castle on the hill-guess what's in it? That's right: Dark Souls. If you like Dark Souls, you are going to have an absolute blast. Elden Ring is an incredible, unforgettable Dark Souls experience. In fact, for you, this review should not be taken as a negative but as an overwhelming positive.That said, if, like me, you have not historically enjoyed Dark Souls? Don't expect there to be much gameplay left beyond that classic loop to make up for it. Elden Ring is a Dark Souls game through and through. The rooms are just wider.Edit: Horse is pretty cool tho.",0
Negative,the white dude at the start called me maidenless and it hurt my feelings 1/10 do not recommend,0
Negative,"I had enormous expectations having put a thousand hours into Dark Souls 3 alone. Sadly, ER is tainted by design decisions not fully thought through, and a refusal to question the ideals of a framework first established with Demon s Souls in 2009, and I ended it wishing I hadn't played it at all (more on this later) - or that Steam would finally add a neutral rating.For context, excluding a discarded run and multiplayer, my completionist and almost entirely guide-free solo run lasted around 150 hours, beating every boss barring Malenia without summons.Let s open positively: Elden Ring inherits DS3 s DNA, particularly combat: The same crunchy brawls, responsive controls and top-tier animations that characterised DS3, aided by expanded enemy, weapon, and ability variety with magic being more diverse than ever.From s signature storytelling returns, requiring piecing together environmental details, item descriptions and other vague information to decipher the full picture, avoiding interminable cutscenes or overbearing HUD notifications.The Lands Between is geographically impressive. It fuses aesthetically and mechanically diverse biomes into vertiginously stacked layers, threading interesting discoveries through challenging navigation, aided by a time of day and weather system that adds subtle gameplay changes.So why the thumbs down?DS3 is great because it s meaningful. It s an incredible fantasy brawler, but shines with its premise of a cursed world having its blighted existence artificially prolonged by an age of fire unnaturally lengthened by Gwyn and his tragic legacy s followers. The Ringed City DLC literally warped and smashed the series together until only ash remained at the end of the world and time itself in a manifestation of cosmic decay from a realm prohibited from moving on. Its creatively defiant metacommentary rejected a pop culture engorged on commercialised nostalgia and humanity s obsession with the past impeding a new, better world being built, using From s own ludography to show stagnation blocking progress. It had to innovate to avoid hypocrisy, so it repurposed old combat mechanics and weaponry into new rhythms, and tonally shifted from quiet hope in the face of graceful sadness to crushing desperation - not to fix its cursed world, but to euthanise it and start anew instead - while retaining the series unrelenting melancholy and heart of gold.ER ignores that. It retroactively invalidates DS3 s message of moving on from an unsustainably tired world by repurposing years of content, and when it does deviate, it does so uncharacteristically clumsily for From. This is why I wish I hadn t played it: DS3 made me laugh, cry, and stuck in my mind for years, and was ultimately about something bigger than itself - and powerfully resonated for it. ER contradicts DS3 s critique of wheel-spinning by indulging repackaged nostalgia in the same way Disney s maligned Star Wars trilogy has left people feeling worse towards the franchise than if no new films had been made at all.The story is shockingly conservative, with almost identical plot points, settings, characters, and themes to From s back catalogue. We again have well-intended rulers cursing the world in an attempt to save it, religious fundamentalists, spurned vengeful offspring, agents of chaos, and a tarnished (now literally!) player enforcing a new world order. The biggest change is a bloated chain of divine command, expanding DS' demigods with Empyrians, Fingers, the Elden Beast, aliens, and cosmic gods, but it brings few new ideas. This is the reanimated corpse of a concluded story that meta-commented on such narrative necromancy, and is immensely disappointing for it. Worse, what little new exists is often explicit and definitive, trading the intriguing mystery of DS s nebulous motivations and history that still produce seismic theories a decade later, for a story nearly entirely resolvable in a single playthrough.There is a tonal shift from quiet tragedy to bellicose grandeur of divine infighting exploding into total warfare - but if anything interferes with deep emotional investment, it s unlikeable middle managers arguing over who deserves the office promotion. Conflict between irredeemable villains is a far cry from the turbulent power of DS s Greek tragedy, particularly in a setting largely morally binary and with a less charismatic cast. Standouts like Rya or Blaidd don't impact like Solaire s devastating misfortune or Siegward s surprising nobility. Characters were the emotional core of DS, but are neutered here by worn tropes and the meandering pacing inherent to open worlds.Gameplay is also a missed opportunity. DS3 s combat is great, but Sekiro s is easily the best ever in a game of its type - yet we re back to DS3 s unbalanced weapon classes and abilities, inconsistent magic, and same old movesets, lacking Sekiro s thrilling posture and counters mechanics. Dual wielding, ashes of war and guard counters are small improvements rather than an overhaul that had six years to materialise, and the camera is as bad as ever. Content suffers from repetition too: Dungeons keep cropping, with the same music, bosses and presentation, occupying a huge chunk of a completionist s playthrough, and the non-dungeon biomes feel interminable as you re incentivised to be extremely thorough in these needlessly enormous areas in search of equipment, lore, and quests.Quests are as obtuse as everyone s saying, borderline impossible to complete without guides, a From staple magnified by the overwhelmingly gigantic map diluting quality even further. ER s first areas are exciting, but fifty hours in become tedious, particularly with the second half s environments primarily being single-level plains with occasional repeated giant assets.The initially impressive scope grows tiresome in its enormity, and leads to a game that s harder to balance and populate with unique content, particularly evident in the later difficulty spikes and clearly unfinished areas and encounters, including final bosses that pale in comparison to the thematic or mechanical significance of DS3 s Soul of Cinder and Slave Knight Gael. Bosses are just bad across the board: Most movesets chain four or five attacks together leave you waiting for an opening far longer than actually fighting, and many require specific builds to overcome damage sponges, homogenising combat into a wait - wait - wait - wait - single attack - wait loop. ~150 bosses is too many for From to make each interesting, fair, memorable, or downright enjoyable.ER s multiplayer is also From s worst since DS1. Hits can sometimes take over ten seconds to register and disconnects prevail. Reduced summon counts neuters fight clubs, invasions are overly unbalanced and spawns are terrible, and with covenants gone, so too are the emergent player dynamics and roleplay.Finally, ER s presentation is mixed. Its style is outstanding: Characters are strikingly creative and full of personality, environments are dense with detail, and sound effects are as satisfying as ever, though the music rarely reaches DS3 s heights and is often repeated. But From s ambition far outpaced their technical capacity: ER is graphically antiquated, but the elephant in the room is the worst shader compilation stutter in years, paired with disappointing framerates, considerable crashing, and cheating aplenty. The stutter single-handedly ruined the first third of my playthrough, dissipating after about 70 hours but never fully resolving, and is bad enough to alone make this review a thumbs down.ER wavers between being a retread of old ideas and a failed attempt at new ones. It's such a missed opportunity. If all you want is killing enemies in brutal combat, it s great - the DS template alone earns ER inherited praise - but if you re after an emotionally and philosophically challenging story, pick up DS instead.",0
Negative,"After patch 1.02.1This patch claims to address some performance issues. First of all, on my rig, the loading times became noticeably slower. Before, travelling to Sites of Lost Grace was almost instant, now it's very much not. I checked with my friend who played before and after - he also noticed the same.Furthermore, now I see stutter in some indoor ares, whereas before I had it mostly in the open-world areas. Outdoor areas are not working any better for me, too. Basically, I have worse experience than before the patch.Original reviewOK, the core of the game is brilliant. Sadly, I can't recommend it now (as of patch 1.02). I disregarded all the technical reviews where a lot of people complained about performance. Most of them didn't run the game on the highest end hardware, so I thought - hey, my specs are better, certainly my hardware will manage. No. This is definitely not subjective, not specific to only my software/hardware, as you can see all over the Internet - people with 20 series and 30 series are having the same problems as I am.I have STRIX RTX 3090 OC, i5-12600K, 32 gigs of DDR5 and WD Black SN850. I also have the latest video card drivers (the ones that explicitly mention Elden Ring support), the latest Windows 10 updates. The game manages to drop frames as low as 40 on pretty much any settings. I also have VRR monitor and it helps but not much - I can perceive frame drops without any FPS counters as it reflects on the gameplay. It's especially noticeable in the open-world areas and affects not only the visual fluidity but also the flow of the battle for me. Basically, not only the frame-rate drops make it harder to time a dodging roll just because the game suddenly stutters right during a boss attack, it also directly translate to input lag where pressing a button does not immediately result in a corresponding action. This game requires precision and the stutter cripples that. In ""dungeons"" (literal dungeons or areas behind the fog) it runs pretty well. For instance, I had no problems during the Margit fight and enjoyed it a lot. But fighting Tree Sentinel was so choppy, I just had to quit the game for good. Edit after playing more. Godrick the Grafted - which is not open-world and is not optional - fight was pretty awful performance-wise. Most of the time it was smooth but at random times, when I was very close to the boss and he would do some attack, the game would stutter. Only because of that it took me almost twice as long to defeat him.Now, on the same hardware I can run Dying Light 2 with all the ray-tracing effects on at 4K (with DLSS) with locked 60 FPS (well, it drops very, very rarely and I can see it only from the counter, it doesn't affect the actual gameplay). If I disable RT in that game, it runs so well, my PC is dead-silent (doesn't stress anything enough to engage fans to make them audible enough). This is mind-blowing. I mean, Elden Ring looks great but it doesn't have any of the interesting technical effects (I wouldn't call this game next-gen in any sense). It doesn't have photorealistic textures of Horizon Forbidden West, it doesn't have incredible shadows and illumination of Dying Light 2.Sadly, I can't refund this anymore: more than 2 hours played. Most of that time I spent trying out different video configurations and going to different areas of the game. Finally, I went on and bought the game on Xbox Series X. In performance mode it looks good (never scales up to 2160p in open-world, so it's not as clear on 4K display as the PC version) and runs perceptibly better (it does have FPS fluctuation but it doesn't effect the gameplay as much as it does on PC). Furthermore, XSX runs the game dead silent, while my PC is very audible in open-world areas, as the game makes the GPU card clock speed go to the maximum (frequencies are higher here when in Dying Light 2 with all the RT).Please, don't support this sort of attitude from the developer with your money, I regret that I did. This is the only new game that runs worse on my PC than on the current generation of consoles. It's beyond ridiculous. If you have the chance, go for the console version, if you don't, just wait for some patches.Some additional information for more clarity.GeForce driver 511.79 (has ""Game Ready for Elden Ring"" in the release notes)Things I've tried in the game settings.- Changing pretty much every setting from lowest to max- 2160p resolution- 1440p resolution - pretty much the same issues. I mean, on RTX 3090 - what the bloody hellNow, it's a D2D12 game, so it has direct access to low-level APIs, which means I had little hope in any of the suggestions found online would help, but it didn't take me too long to try, so I did:- The ""High performance"" thing in Graphics Settings of Windows- Unlimited ""Shader Cache Size"" in NVIDIA settings- Disabling ""Microsoft Device Association Root Enumerator""None of the above resulted in a smooth experience. Basically, whatever is causing the stutter, would cause the stutter no matter what settings I had. I can run at 1080 with lowest settings and get stutters at exactly the same places as with 2160p and maximum settings. The game is not bottlenecked by any of my hardware, it's something wrong about the way the developers used D3D12, it seems.Out of curiosity, I've underpowered my GPU (from power target 100% to 80%), lowered GPU boost clock from 1860 MHz to 1674 MHz. Listen to this - no effect on the performance whatsoever! I mean, Elden Ring was actually utilizing the GPU to the max and stuttering. Now it works absolutely the same with significantly underpowered GPU.Now, as for comparison to XSX version, as I've played it a bit more now.- Initial loading time (continue from main menu) is twice as slow on Xbox Series X as on my PC! This is a bummer.- Looks like loading time on death are slightly better than the initial loading, but it's still much slower than that of PC.- In open-world the resolution is very noticeably lower than 2160p. Furtermore, the frame-rates are very eager to drop. My current go-to for testing is the very early Tree Sentinel fight. On PC it's jarringly bad. On XSX, in addition to having sub-4K resolution, the frame-rate here goes pretty low but it doesn't feel that bad with VRR. I actually almost killed the boss with the initial-level character on my first attempt on XSX. On PC I struggled to kill him even after gaining levels and downing Margit - only because of the major stutter.In conclusion, please don't give money to this kind of developer. I see already that the game sold very well on PC and it's sad. I mean, who forced the company to release the PC version without properly testing it? I am awfully sure, they were aware of the performance issues when they released it (otherwise they had zero testing, which is even worse). Why not release the console versions first and delay the PC version? Also, I scanned the Steam forums/reviews and there are still plenty of people claiming they have a smooth experience. At this point, I don't believe they do. By now I know some people tend not to pay attention. I've seen plenty of people - before current-gen consoles - claiming they are totally happy with 30 FPS in their games and saying that 60 does not improve the game. Now look - since the PS5 and XSX started having plenty of games supporting higher frame rates, the console crowd is loving it and complainign about new games running at 30 FPS. Now people are saying that anything higher than 60 is unnecessary and not even perceivable (yeah, right). In a couple of generation the consoles will have 120 FPS in plenty of games and people will enjoy that.",0

Negative,"This is basically a negative review for people, who like soulslikes and all previous souls and sekiro games. If it's your first game it might be fine for you (albeit very hard on the main bosses). I've played for 13 hours, beaten about 2-3 major and 4-6 minor bosses and I want to say, that it's honestly underwhelming. Firstly, as usual, it recycles a LOT of previous enemies and bosses from dev's games. However, what NEW it adds, makes very little sense and does not feel thought out at all at times. As if this game was composed by ubisoft. So, now we have crafting. What it does it do? You can craft arrows and some consumables after hunting down some animals and searching for plants. Is hunting animals fun, you ask? No. Is looting plants fun? No. In previous games you simply bought all the stuff but honestly you usually didn't bother at all, because consumables aren't required for progress. Then, there's ""open world"". It's basically same as crafting, as in I have no idea why they added it. Now there's maps, there's monster camps of sorts and there's dungeons (we get on this one later). Maps are aquired very easily and only reveal landscape. Even without it there's no difficulty in navigating, but the problem is, once again, there's no real fun to be had. Interesting encounters are almost non-existent, and there's nearly no good loot to be found (and even if there was, you can't tell if your search will provide you something useful). I must say, the dungeons are obscenely bad. All dungeons are structured similarly and their bosses often are very halfassed. There's next to none story or interesting feel to the dungeon, usually it's just some random caves or crypt with cruelly placed enemies and single obscure item in the end. Other than that, this is basically a Ubisoft game which was built over the stronger DS3 base. You want more of DS 3? Then you can get this. You want something closer to sekiro or something more original? Better get nioh 2, it's way more fun. Honestly, I'm surprsied Miyazaki did such a poor job on the new mechanics he decided to implement, but I also have some faith that latter parts of the game will be better than what I saw so far.Edit after ~60 hours:So, as I'm closing to the finale of the game I have a better grasp of its problems. Basically, the closest comparison I'm willing to give, it's a Dark Souls 2 all over again, some parts are better, some worse, but it's basically underwhelming to the premise. The core problem of the game is that it tried to go 'open world' and adapted the worst parts of it without addressing the ingame issues which make this awkward. Many of those aren't seen intially but become apparent the more you play.This is not true openworld. ER has no quests (as in visible, trackable quests you can do for fun), no activities, barely any feel of exploration. Worst of all, the areas are VERY restricted at where you can go. There's also no cool movement stuff like glider, graphook or really anything but basic horse. I'd not really like to present this as an issue (except for people who genuinely wanted an open world game), but as ER was advertised as such, the intention has clearly failed. Worse even, by trying to go 'open world', the game plays very awkward after you progress a bit and go into areas which clearly were planned to be progressed earlier. And there's a LOT of those. The game has astonishing amount of repeating enemies and bosses. There's probably like 10 dragon fights which have same model and similar movesets. There's about 6 (or more) golden knights. It's actually easier to name a boss which wasn't reused multiple time through the game. The enemies aren't very different either. Remember how every skyrim dungeon had draugers? This is it, same stuff different hp and damage everywhere. Before I finish, I want to name some more issues, which really should've been fixed but didn't. Why not every boss has a respawn point by it? Just look at Sekiro.Why you introduced new respawn points which are terribly hard to see in a murky pallete? Why not make it glowing?Why weight system wasn't reworked so player would not have to juggle stuff like bows and torches out of their inventory? Just look at Nioh 1/2.Why not make souls autopickup when entering boss room (which also does not alloiw you simple escape anymore to save it). Just look at Nioh 1/2. Why not allow us to use runes/items at the campfire/shop? Why close the inventory after you've used 1? Why weapon damage system wasn't reworked? The problem with DS weapon system is that you can't realistically know how good is the weapon later on without upgrading it and having stats for it, so more often you end up with a weapon you've started with or planned to play with. You can't switch weapons most of the time because anything you find will be unupgraded. This is simply bad design for an open world game with a variety of cool weapons. Just look at Nioh 1/2. I'd also like to critic the combat system but I'm willing to accept that it's a dark souls 3 system and they are unwilling to change (even though I believe sekiro is vastly superior), but at least fix the management systems. Speaking of some stuff I quite enjoyed and welcome:Summons are kinda cool concept even though it's very stupid you can only summon them at specific points. Like, why?Talisman pouches/memory slots is a good concept (even though they were already existing in like hollow knight)Weapon arts are really cool, albeit fairly imbalanced. Also the ability to change your weapon enchant for free for your current situation at the camp site is great.Similarly, buffing potion is good, albeit pretty weak.",0

Negative,"I wish there was a neutral recommendation, but whatever. The game up to Lyndell is awesome, but then the quality of the game drops substantially. Recycled/unbalanced enemies and reused dungeon designs, for example. The open world has beatiful landscapes, but there is not much incentive at story level to go through the dungeons, or the loot is bad if you are not caster. Also FS should have improved the gameplay, like they do with Bloodborne or Sekiro, but they choose to keep the old school DS movesets. The thing is that the enemies attacks were improved lol (I'm looking at you, Malenia). Anyway. 6.5/10 for me. A really really good game, but with serious flaws; some of them from previous games, like the camera against giant enemies.",0
Negative,"I feel both sad and glad to have seen a company rise to glory and fall to stagnation and complacency. While the open world is incredibly impressive, the game becomes a self parody through badly designed bosses, copy paste bosses, enemy spam, horse combat, unbalanced abilities, a OST that is basic DS boss music without any inovation or personality and a world that can not account for player levels (you are either blowing up everything or barely scratch enemies). It is incredibly depressing that this is what from soft will stick with, since they are being blasted with positive reviews. It started off like exactly what i expected and hoped for, but fell apart the further i got. If this is your first from soft game, just spare yourself the trouble and play DS1 instead.",0
Negative,"that's what happens when you have a console-exclusive beta. we're paying a full price for this game too, and we deserve a perfect experience too.dark souls was terrible, pc modders fixed that. 11 years later, from software releases another unplayable pc port. fix your game and take us seriously. your amazingly beautiful games are no excuse for these bad ports.",0
Negative,"UPDATE: Finished the game after 60 or so hours, including the secret areas. I've skipped some optional ruins and minor dungeons. Gonna leave the original review below for reference. Again, this review won't talk about performance and optimization issues, widely acknowledged by everyone and still (hopefully) to be patched sooner or later.First, the good: it's always nice to be back to Souls games. The formula behind these games is a winning one: addicting, charming, challenging. They are good games and, with the right mindset, very enjoyable ones. Elden Ring is no different in that sense it manages to deliver the same engrossing experience we all came to love during these years. For the record, I've been playing souls games since Demon's Soul, which remains still one of my favorites.Now, let's tackle the issues I've got with Elden Ring.- The gameplay formula is my main gripe here. There are other problems I will address later but this here is the true source of my frustration, which inevitably spoiled most of the enjoyment I had. People say that it all started with DS3, but personally I believe it was a slow process of ""memification"" of the Souls genre gameplay. The git gud mentality behind it all which steered all design decisions towards what I consider now a pure CBT and ultimately unfun experience. The perfect summary I've read around is: ""it feels you're playing Dark Souls while every enemy is playing Bloodborne"".Slow, uncancellable animations are sometimes so annoying it feels you're playing with 500 ping all the time. Most of the bosses (and even enemies) are hysterical, aoe spamming madlads with perfect hit tracking, inconceivable hitboxes and so many AOE moves that sometimes they feel copypasted. Imagine Pontiff Sulyvahn on crack. Not enough? Ok now imagine zoning AOE bosses, sorta like Laurence of crack. That's 90% of how I felt my experience with Elden Ring.And it makes me sad to think about bosses like Rennala (it felt like i was fighting a real witch) , the Fire Giant (aoe monster but slow and earth shattering) or even the stupid Mimic. How unique and interesting they felt. Even Radahn had an incredible concept but holy mother of god in the end it became spam Y to summon meat puppets and dodge the oneshot hits.I'm not gonna talk about Malenia.I'm not gonna do it.Too soon.- Said that, the other (secondary but still quite perceivable) issue I've got here is the amount of recycled content and how derivative most if the world feels. Is the ""open world"" empty? Not really. But I believe they've chosen quantity over quality. The more I played the more I felt diminishing returns in exploration and boss fighting enjoyment.Some bosses appear again and again during the game, sometimes as minibosses, sometimes as slightly reskinned new bosses, sometimes OH WAIT THERE'S TWO NOW! Areas start repeating themselves very soon and biomes only offer some respite in the creeping familiarity that inevitably kicks in after a while.The most jarring example of this is the Siofra River area and boss. Design: absolutely incredible. Gameplay of the area: not really a fan of aimbot snipers but hey, it's easily rushable so whatever. Boss: simple, fascinating, one of the most memorable music track in the game. They basically copypasted everything, from lightning the beacons to unlock the boss fight to the boss fight itself (with a couple of added gimmick moves). Why? Not only it feels cheap but it manages to take out the beauty and uniqueness of the area you encountered the first time.So yeah, I confirm my suspicions of my early review: Elden Ring feels like a step back for From Software compared to a Bloodborne or a Sekiro. Not only it's their comfort zone, it's the festering Blight Town comfort zone where the Souls franchise is now sitting in semi-stagnation. Open world and jumping are not enough to call it ""the most daring"" Souls ever made.Good game? Yes.Mediocre Souls? Also yes.-Original review:Elden Ring is a classic Souls game, exactly what you'd expect, which is why I find it disappointing. I find the raving reviews talking about the most ""daring"" and ""ambitious"" souls game ever misleading. Compared to the Dark Souls franchise's gameplay, Elden Ring doesn't feel much different: i-frame rolls, parries, critical attacks (jump attacks are just another way to trigger them), poke and repeat. Bloodborne, a game from 2015, tried to innovate the formula in a more meaningful way and it felt different, at least a tiny bit. Sekiro, released before Elden Ring, completely revolutionized the formula and soaked it in crystal meth. How can you say that Elden Ring is the most ambitious souls game when older souls game tried so much harder to shake things up? Sadly to me, Elden Ring feels like a step back.The open world aspect feels gimmicky, a way to follow nowadays trend where every game should have a crafting system and a faraway mountain you can go to. The world so far has felt empty, just a bland grassland linking together various areas and dungeons, some of which are truly wondrous (Siofra River anyone?) but most got me saying ""I've been here before"".All souls game feel like rites of passage: with sweat and pain you git gud and when you git gud you are able to delve deeper in a mysterious world, or enjoy a gorgeous new scenery, or have the chance to wreck a new abomination's ass. This time, the suffering is starting to feel a bit more pointless, which is a shame.Is it a good game? Yes.Is it a good souls game? No, so far I've found it uninspired and bland. One of the weakest of the franchise.",0
Negative,"Not very good PC port. Do not buy the game at this moment. You create your character, watch the opening, then there's a black screen and the game crashes to desktop. And even If you don't crash every 10 minutes, the performance is really bad, even with everything on low. That was my experience and many others' it seems. It's kind of unplayable right now.With this many crashes and frame rate drops, a hotfix is inevitable. But wait until then. Cool character customization I guess. That's all I can say about the actual game because that's as far as I got. I'm sure this would be a great game once the performance issues are fixed.",0
Negative,"Amazing game, I'm quite in love with it. I'm editing this review later on into a proper one, but I'm leaving a negative review because Bandai is at it again trying to straight up rob people with their prices in south america.There's no excuse for these prices, since they can still load their pockets from people who can actually pay for them in first world countries, so I'm putting negatives on every game that updates prices to unreasonable amounts in a market that actually allows for regionalization.And for all my south american friends out there who can't pay for it: Just play the Jack Sparrow version, don't let them get away with it ;)",0

Negative,"I hope I'm wrong, the first two hours of this game left a bad impression on me. A cheap game like DS2! Poorly designed levels and enemies.andI am getting stuttering like crazy, no matter what settings!-Update after 150+ hours:The first 30 hours, the game is kind of fun, but then it becomes boring after that.Why? bc RPG mechanics are the problemLet's take a step back and compare the game to Zelda BOTWYou can go anywhere in Zelda without conditions unlike Elden Ring, but that's not what matters for now.Why would you want to explore? In Zelda, when you find a weapon or an item, you can IMMEDIATELY use it and enjoy the adventure. Elden Ring is limited by its RPG mechanics, which makes it very different. With Zelda, the player is immediately rewarded and his exploration time is estimated. With Elden Ring, the player is given a weapon or an item that does not work with his build, not to mention repeating the same area and the same bosses!. BTW Elden Ring has more than 150 boss but it s actually a 20 bosses repeated!I believe that if they had used the same progression system in The Surge 2, this game would have been the game of the generation.",0
Negative,"Here's an interesting ordeal about Elden Ring: The Souls Formula? It's very much there! Entertaining gameplay? Very much there. Cool bosses? Very much there! Unfortunately, for a title that really does have all the potential to be -the- game of the half-decade, it falls short in the QA, testing, and QOL department. How? Let me give you a list of reasons.-For some reason FromSoft decided that certain things, such as having a check that'll have the game basically insult you for 'not closing it correctly' was more important than fixing crashes. Guess what causes that check that makes the game insult you for not closing it correctly? Crashes! Guess what Elden Ring likes to do? Crash!-Crashing can also corrupt your savefile and if you're not lucky enough that Steam made a cloud backup you're permanently screwed over and have to restart from scratch. Say goodbye to your 100+ hour character!-Did you know that players can place a message at the bottom of a ladder and grief you by making it next to impossible to climb? They can do that! Same thing for the top of the ladder. I certainly hope you didn't fall down a pit in a certain mine and were scrambling to try and find a way up while a giant iron maiden with saws for hands was trying to murder you, because you'll get to it, be unable to climb it, and pressing the interact button will just bring up a message from some moron that reads 'try fingers, but hole!' as the giant 10' fullmetal killing machine grabs you from behind and kills you instantly. Why did they not pick up on this in QA testing again? Oh, by the way, you'll find this at nearly every ladder where something will be trying to kill you while you're climbing it, because people are morons.-Fall damage is terminally inconsistent. There are sections where you can fall ten stories and survive without a scratch, like in some towers! There are others where you'll jump off a five foot high drop, freeze, then die upon hitting the ground.-Stutters! I run this on a computer that could theoretically be taken from NASA's server farm and I still get random times where it'll freeze for five seconds or drop to 1-5 frames for several seconds. Guess when this likes to happen? During boss fights and times where things are trying to murder me.-Were you a victim of dark bead mage twinking in DS3? Guess what they didn't solve? Twinking! You better be ready to get invaded by glass cannons that've dedicated their entire build to INT for using Moonveil or STR and ARC in order to wield the pair of swords that create an instakilling gravity nuke that has an AOE the size of a debate hall. Are you not ready for them? Guess you're never playing multiplayer, then! Because they're the most common invader types you'll run into, and they're literally everywhere.-Looking for build variety in PVP? Sorry! Everyone's either using bleed proc weapons or the gravity nuke swords, you will occasionally find a person with a normal build, otherwise it's going to be pain and suffering all the way down. They're using bleed proc because bleed proc is one of the few ways to compensate for boss absurdity, by the way.-If you're co-oping with buddies whatsoever you're agreeing to being invaded, and as you may see from the 'They didn't fix twinking' up above, take my advice: You should get to the next boss fight fast, because every second you linger is a second closer to another glass cannon invading and oneshotting you and your friends.-The grind to level up is horrendous after you clear level 30! Hope you're alright with having to farm in excess of 10,000 runes for a single level and losing all of them to an invader or an enemy or boss you weren't ready for. By the way, there's a guy in a certain castle that'll just straight up steal a massive chunk of your runes every time you die and you have to kill him to make it stop. Does the game tell you this? No! So.Even if you get them back you're losing progress. Also, he's apparently bugged to the point where his rune stealing will happen -anywhere- you die on the map, have fun with that.-Also on the topic of the grind, looking to play legitimately? Sucks to be you, pal! You're going to be getting invaded by glass cannons, twinks, and people who are nonstop running rune farms left, right, and center.Which means you'll have to run rune farms to stay competitive, which means you'll be spending more time farming than actually playing the game.-Expecting bosses that have attack patterns that make sense? Sorry! One of the first ones you fight is literally a twelve foot tall guy with superheavy attacks that moves like a ballerina and won't stop faking out or hesitating on his attacks which makes learning his patterns infuriatingly difficult. This will happen a lot.-There are multiple spots in the world where you'll just be minding your business and FromSoft will happily drop an enemy far beyond your level and equipment rating atop you as a boss.-Get ready for a lot of ""It's about skill, not gear."" while you're fighting enemies with an instantly casting hitscan spell that drives your character to madness and kills them instantly! Also get ready for deathblight, a thing that exists solely to kill you instantly, and all the people running deathblight invasion builds for this exact reason.-Really, people are incredibly fond of saying 'skill issue' when FromSoft casually drops what is effectively an ancient deity of chaos and madness on you in the overworld when you're sixty levels below where you should be to fight it.-By the way, on the topic of that 'skill issue', a heavily upgraded regular sword can take upwards of 50 successful hits to kill the first major boss while a slightly upgraded katana can do it in around ten swings and two bleed procs. Still about skill? It never was! Equip bleed and watch a quarter of the health of a boss or 3/4ths the health of a PVP invader vanish once that procs.It's a great game with plenty of merit! Clearly it has something to it, because I've played 43 hours at the moment of writing this review and I'm still coming back, but the problem is that there is so much rough around the edges, missed bugfixing, worn spots that need polish, and rust that needs to be buffered out which FromSoft have either accidentally or willfully overlooked. Maybe you'll take it like everybody else and say it's your game of the year! I have to disagree. I'm having fun playing it, but that fun is directly tied to whether or not me and my friends can go 30 seconds without being invaded by another Moonveil twink who has found the most optimal route to instantly kill three people with one use of its special attack the second they exit bonfire range.",0

Negative,performance is terrible.I was torn between this and the PS5 Version.as you can tell I chose wrong. Praise the sun while waiting for patch.,0
Negative,"I'm sorry for leaving a negative review, but I feel like this game is going to be the first step in a long, downward-spiralling road for FromSoft. People are playing this up as a masterpiece of FromSoft's when the issues are even more glaring than when people were screeching about DS2's ""faults"". I don't want this to become the Gold Standard for FromSoft (Pun Intended). My complaints have nothing to do with the open-world, and though I wish there were less carbon-copy bosses, I think it was fine to reuse them a little every now and then to fill out the sheer size of the place. Constant boss duos was miserable though, please stop doing that. godskin duo, magma wyrm and the falling star beast particularly were just awful bosses that i loathe to even remember. Nigh-undodgeable shockwaves that every large enemy constantly spams also really doesn't help. Long combos punctuated by the boss delaying for 13 college semesters, allowing you to write a dissertation and graduate summa cum laude with a doctorate's in patience before he decides to hit you for all your HP 3 times over in the span of a millisecond with FromSoft's patented ""funny tracking TM"" also leaves a bad taste in my mouth.The health and damage scaling in this game is unlivable. Everyone is doing the same 4 cookie-cutter meta builds just to survive the game, let alone do PvP. There is *no* room for build variety in this game, even with so many gosh-darn weapons and armor options. I had to ditch the mace partway through for the sword of night and flame because ordinary, mundane weapons just don't survive into the late game, except for maybe the same greatswords that have been equally-busted ever since DS1. Even with all the weapon upgrades, ordinary one-handers just fall off in damage and the way bosses execute combos with blinding speed or with stupidly-long delays, making windows to attack TINY, it's just not worth having a faster-swinging one-hander instead of a hard-hitting two-hander. I am sick of being buried as a sword-and-board build in every game.On top of that, dying in one hit to one attack in a boss' combo if you aren't actively dumping a third of your total levels in an NG into vigor is unacceptable. If there is a previous game that had this issue, then correct me, but I have never seen it be so bad in a FromSoft game before, especially with how this game packages bosses in a way that they fight like bosses from Sekiro while giving you Dark Souls III movement and controls. It is a recipe for disaster. I have never before now had the issue in a FromSoft game where when I kill a boss, I think ""Thank God that's over"" instead of ""That was a cool fight with neat atmosphere."" of course there a few black sheep bosses in every FromSoft game, but I have felt that consistently with every boss after Godrick (I personally liked his fight). It is a chore to fight bosses, especially when their health gets insurmountably high and one single mistake in a fight with them means instant death.People saying to upgrade summons kinda proves my point because the game is so unreasonable in terms of boss health and damage, unforgiving combos, punishing you for punishing enemies and etc. that you are forced to play a very specific way if you want to reasonably win. I don't like games that have only one way to be played, ESPECIALLY when one of their biggest consistent selling points is offering you a wide range of customization options. Also for God's sake please add a left-handed option, DS2 allowed me to beat the game left-handed and it drives me insane that a game touts customization but then refuses to have an option for people who make up 15% of the freaking population. That's gotta be enough to warrant a left-hand option if devs caved to the pressure of the 2 whole people banshee-wailing about replacing gender with body type.I've got a lot of time in all of the fromsoft games, DS 1-3, Sekiro, I've even cleared all the King's Field games except for the first one with a buddy. I wanted to love this game, it looked like a great co-op adventure, and I was willing to overlook the design decisions inspired by George R R Martin (The kinds of stories he writes just don't fit with FromSoft's history of design, in my opinion, George writes too much about sex and political intrigue, and the lore with Mohgwyn and the lover's spat between Radagon and whats-her-face just didn't feel like it belonged, in my opinion) but this game just really made me sad. I was repping this game all the way up to release.All in all, Bok the seamster was my one refuge in this game. I truly loved his character, he was delightful. That's it for my review.",0
Negative,"The game is great. The multiplayer is not.I bought this game so that I could play with my boyfriend, same as we have in other games. First of all, you do have to farm items to continue to summon your friends. There are a lot in the starting areas but in some others there just aren't any materials to do this, so you must backtrack. This is annoying as I have somewhat limited time to play.On top of that, you frequently experience crashes and disconnects. You have to either backtrack (if it's possible) to collect your friend again or they need to rush the area.What we discovered today drove me to write this review. If you kill enough or a certain boss in an area (I have no idea which one it is), multiplayer is DISABLED FOR THE OPEN WORLD in this region. I cannot play with my friends anymore because I killed something (still don't know what!).This is archaic and stupid for an open world game which has so much to explore. We have maybe 1/3 of the dungeons left to do in that area and now we just can't do it together. Completely outrageous and I may have refunded this game had I known sooner - or at least, I would have skipped bosses and rushed them at the end.Another thing to mention is the invasions which can't be turned off if you want to co-op. since it's an open world game with free progression, most of the invaders have been able to oneshot us from substantial range. Whoops, there goes another multiplayer resource, time to backtrack, and well I'll just forget about my souls after doing all those other fucking chores.Edit: There is now a Seamless Coop mod. USE IT! It's great and what the game should be.",0
Negative,It's been 2 years and the frame stuttering is still happening.,0
Negative,"I have very conflicted feelings about Elden Ring. On one hand I spent more hours than I would like to admit going through the giant world that Elden Ring offers and enjoyed searching for hidden paths and loot. In particular for the first say 20 hours I thought there was a lot variety with enemies, bosses and environments. On the other hand I ended up being very frustrated with the design of dungeons, enemies and gameplay. As the game went on, reused assets and uninspiring level design became increasingly apparant and it felt like the game overall started to crash under its own weight. While the lore at first was interesting, and there are elements that I still like, much of it felt cheap and unsatisfying the more I dwelled into it. The memories of good experiences were increasingly soured by these faults and more.In terms of presentation the game looks great and there are stunning vistas spread around the world, and many of the enemies look and sound great. It is not technically out of this world, but definitely very satisfying to look at and listen to.Gameplay-wise I initially experimented a lot of different tools and weapons that the game had to offer. I played very melee focused and had a lot of fun in finding out how consumables and enchancements could change the efficiency of weapons, and customize my equipment and strategy for each boss. Further into the game though I figured out a combination and strategy that ended up dominating more or less everything else I tried. I tried out using magic as well but it didn't work well with the spec I had, and using spells were also not that fun. There was also an increasing amount of enemies and bosses with attacks that were more tiresome to deal with. Instead of being thrilled from beating a boss I felt more relieved of not having to deal with it anymore. There was a great deal of reuse of enemies as well which made new encounters increasingly boring.Traversing the world as well became increasingly boring, as it is very big but lacks ways for you to interact with it. There are some interesting parts with hidden ledges and paths that lead to secrets but they are far between and you do not readily unlock new abilities or find equipment that significantly changes traversal in the big open world.I was also initially intriged by the world and wanted to explore of it and learn about its inhabitants. There are some serious issues that kept getting in the way however. Quests often involve talking to NPCs in particular various locations. Sometimes you will get a hint to where the next part of the quest take place but many times there will be no hints at all. While I understand the rational behind this design, to make the world seem less 'gamey', the open world format makes it likely that you will not find that place, or so much time will pass that you forget about details regarding the quest. On top of that I found a great deal of the stories and quests to not really have that interesting outcomes with little to no consequence in the greater scheme. The main story itself also ended on a somewhat dull note and there more I look into it, the more pitiful it becomes. There are some elements though that I am still find interesting though, which I hope get fleshed out further in DLC down the line.All in all I end up with a negative feeling from Elden Ring, which is a shame considering the good times I actually had. I think it comes down to my desire to explore every nook and cranny, which while fun in itself was ruined by repetitiveness. If you choose to not do that you might have a much time with it than I did.",0
Negative,"Post SotET: My review beneath still stands and I'd say they've now doubled down. The DLC suffer from all the issues of the base game. No enemy variety, boring and useless dungeons(hope you wanted MORE spirit ashes), boss reuse and bad encounter design. Elden Ring together with its DLC has me thinking that I wont bother with future FromSoft titles. But perhaps we'll see a return to form instead of another filler fiesta.Technical issues aside, this game suffers from many flaws relating to encounter design and encounter reuse (as well as other things). Were I to only grade it based on the scope and quality of its world, it'd get a solid 10/10. But this isn't a walking simulator and that world is filled with things to do, things which start out interesting and fresh but after the 20th dungeon with the same aesthetic, the 10th dragon fight, the 10th Erdtree Avatar fight, etc, it begins to overstay its welcome.What if we ignore reuse? Are the unique encounters, of which there are around 10, rewarding and engaging? In my opinion, as a (ultra)great/colossal sword user, no. Compared to Dark Souls 3, which this game is mechanically a continuation of, the bosses provide far fewer windows of reprieve for me to actually whack them with my colossal sword. During these brief windows there is also a chance for them to spontaneously continue their attack chain for 1 extra attack in order to punish me for trying to punish them. Meaning you can, very often, stand around for more than 10 seconds to just get a single attack in and even then get punished for it. The punishment coming in the form of an attack that hits so hard it 1 shots you in the late game, unless you've put 40+ points into vigor.Based on some statements by FromSoft, I believe this to be partially due to the inclusion of the new spirit summon mechanic. In previous entries you summoned NPCs or players from designated summon signs whilst in this they provide you with a seemingly never ending list of mostly useless summons. They've said that they wished for summoning to be easier to do in this game, leading me to believe that they wished for it to be a core mechanic which everyone makes use of. So how do spirit summons affect the point in my previous paragraph? Well, they make everything far too easy instead. FromSoft boss Ai was never made with multiple targets in mind, so adding just a single extra ally to the players side trivializes most bosses. They'll always focus the target they last received damage from, at which point it's free game for the other ones to do however much damage they see fit at little to no risk whilst the focused target can just focus on dodging, not having to worry about finding a damage window.I have more complaints about this, but the above paragraphs include my main ones.",0

Negative,"Elden RIng is just worse than all 3 Dark Souls games.The only thing it does that Dark Souls doesn't is the open world and while that is really nice at the beginning, it gets old pretty fast,But the biggest problem of Elden Ring are its bosses. There are only like 5 unique bosses, the rest gets used over and over and over in various gank setups in the increasingly shittier caves as the game goes on. And the worst part is, even the unique bosses aren't that good. FromSoft said they want to make the game more accessible and lower the requirements on coop and it shows. It shows so badly. Most bosses just attack nonstop, or teleport around their arenas, so you either summon help or you use one of the broken builds and just trade hits with them. The boss design is just so boring, for the last few achievements, I just used the mimic tear summon and went like 50 levels higher than I originally planned to just to finally get it over with.Closing thoughts: Elden Ring is a huge disappointment, most of the time you'll feel like a DS2 remake with the amount of shitty reskin gank bosses and the few main bosses are very poorly designed. The open world is nice, but gets old relatively fast and very early into the game you'll just ride by everything.",0
Negative,"I'm so conflicted on this. I love this game, genuinely. I've already spent nearly 200 hours on it. I want it to be the most amazing soulslike experience out there because the potential is there. There are so many things that the game exceeds at and what keeps pulling me back in for more playthroughs. I've beaten every boss, gotten every rememberance, I'm currently trying to beat the game without summons and without wearing armor, that's how much I love playing this game.But the flaws in Elden Ring are too great, and that's what kind of stings. It really does feel like Fromsoft started to get high off of their own reputation as ""that one company that makes the insanely hard games,"" so much so that they made a game that's just completely bullshit. There's a difference between something being hard and something being challenging. Dark Souls 3 had so many amazing bosses that were difficult but were so challenging, engaging, and generally all around fun. The final boss of DS3, for me, is probably one of the most amazing boss fights in the entire Dark Souls series. I absolutely cannot say the same about Elden Ring.Gank fights (Valiant Gargoyles, Commander Niall, Godskin Duo) that weren't made with consideration at all with respect to how they would be able to fight with you, so you just end up being unfairly attacked on all sides. Bosses with utterly insane combos (Malenia, Morgott, Maliketh) that force to i-frame through 20 different attack and give you half a second to punish or leave you too much out of stamina to even attack. The insane input reading (Crucible Knight, Godskin Duo, Draconic Sentinel) that causes the enemies to attack you the INSTANT you let go of the heal button. Nigh undodgable AOE attacks (Valiant Gargoyles, Commander Niall, Godfrey) Completely ludicrous difficulty spikes (Everything post Leyndell) where, even if you have 45 vigor, enemies will just two shot you.I'm being genuine when I say Fromsoft is trying TOO HARD to appeal to their reputation for being the company that made Dark Souls. The thing that made Dark Souls 3 so brilliant was that almost every boss was fast and punishing but made with perfect balance so that at all times you knew exactly how you messed up and how you can learn from next time in order to beat them. I beat every boss in DS3 feeling proud of myself. I beat every boss in Elden Ring just stewing in frustration. What challenge is there in trying to juggle two unabalanced gargoyles, or getting instantly killed by Malenia's waterfowl dance? There is none, there's nothing to learn. For a lot of people, they don't feel like they overcame a challenge, they feel like they lucked out because a boss didn't use a completely broken moveset. Compared to Dark Souls 3 or Sekiro, Elden Ring just feels so lazy. Why bother crafting a perfect boss experience when you can just give Malenia hyperpoise every time she attacks, or have the Godskin Duo punish you every time you try to heal?As much as I hate to admit this, I think a lot of the issues I have with this game stems from Fromsoft trying to stretch a Dark Souls game into an open world game, which is a shame because the open world is what I like most. Content recycling is rampant. The same few catacombs are repeated over and over again through the land. I think after Leyndell there are no unique enemies that even appear, it's all enemies you've seen before. I think the most egregious is that out of the 165 boss in this game, only around 5-10 do not have a duplicate boss somewhere else. I was so excited exploring in Limgrave because all of the boss designs were so unique in interesting, it was so exciting just randomly exploring and suddenly encountering a boss out in the wild. That feeling quickly faded once I encountered my sixth Ulcerated Tree Spirit, or 4th Tibia Mariner. The most insane is them reusing ASTEL and GODRICK in completely unrelated areas, completely robbing those bosses of any uniqueness they had. Genuinely, the game should've ended after Leyndell, or at least should've left the Mountaintops of the Giants an optional area you didn't have to go through in order to beat.There are so many things I love about this game, and I wish it could be so much better because the potential is there. But the world design in the second of half of the game becomes so much more stale, and the bosses in the game are even weaker than the ones in Dark Souls 2, in a ""It's a Dark Souls-like game so let's just make things insanely difficult for no reason"" kind of way, I really hope that a major patch fixes some of these issues, or they improve their design in the DLC, because I am not at all excited in the direction Fromsoft is taking themselves, as a company that tries way too hard to play up to their reputation for difficult games that they forget to make it fun first. I saw a comment in a Youtube video a while back that said ""Once the hype dies down, people will talk about this game the same way they talk about Dark Souls 2,"" and I fear they may be right. Too many flaws bog down what could've been a 10/10 game.",0

Insane amounts of stutterlagKeyboard and Mouse support is hilariously bad.I really wanted to enjoy the game, but the tragically bad performance makes it unplayable.",0
Negative,"I wanted to like the game, but it's too punishing to be fun. If you think you'd enjoy repeating dungeons half a dozen times until you memorise the fight mechanics of each pack of mobs so you can finally reach the boss with enough flasks to maybe stand a chance at beating it, you'll enjoy this game. I don't doubt there is a skill issue at play, but I don't have the will to practise until I'm good enough to a play a game. I just wanted to run around killing things with magic and a sword. For fans of other RPG games such as Skyrim or Witcher, you might not enjoy this game unless you're looking for a punishing, trial and error combat system.I didn't get very far into the game, so perhaps the story gets better, but I wasn't sure if there was a narrative. The game tells you nothing. I didn't necessarily dislike the openness (or complete lack of direction), allowing you to choose your own path, but it becomes another punishing aspect of the game when you're walled off of areas by level without realising and end up dead (again). Of course, you can wait to go back, but it gets very frustrating when this happens repeatedly (again with the trial and error). I'd have quit the game hours before I did had I not watched videos online to help, giving me vague directions or aims, but all they really did were delude me into thinking I could do it if I tried one more time or travelled to a different part of the map. And then, even after one (or three) more times, I felt no satisfaction from my victory because I realised every encounter in the game was going to be like this. To put it simply, the game required from me more time than I'm willing to give in order to 'git gud'. A lot of people seem to like that process. I don't, and if you don't, you won't like Elden Ring. I suspect I won't enjoy any of the 'souls-like' games, which is good to know!",0

Negative,"Elden Ring is a masterpiece in its world, atmosphere and landscape design with incredible cutscenes and amazing enemy bosses. That's the only part it gets right. Elden Ring is specifically designed for those who would not mind the slightest in doing repeated fights just to overcome one challenge. The endgame difficulty spike is huge and definitely something that should be worked upon. Common enemies are designed and placed into the world in such a way to jump attack you at every turn, and most of the time you'll be anxiously going through regions anticipating these ""jump attacks"". It's overdone and pointless. Side quests are a joke, you will have to end up using a ""strategy guide"" (aka YouTube) to complete these quests. It would be impossible to figure them out without any help, even with the player messages by online players. There is no way to figure out where to go next for some of these quests and where the NPC will be available for you to speak with after doing something for them. Examples would be the Sellen, Millicent and Ranni's questlines. The UI and UX needs work, a mouse wheel menu would've been much better to handle the different kinds of spells/incantations and items the game throws at you. Instead, you are stuck with pressing one button to cycle through the items until you find the one you are looking for. Poor optimization with microstuttering and performance issues which are still not fixed. Cherry on top is having no way to turn off certain effects like Chromatic Aberration. Story is given to you in pieces but you can make a sense of it as you progress. You are free to do whatever region/zone you want first which is nice though the world is de-levelled and does not scale to your level. If you do not mind the creepy creatures (basilisks, man-serpents, fingers to name a few), the horror-like jumpscares at every two turns, the insane difficulty, then this game is for you. There's an easy mode mod available which evens the odds a bit which can make the game far more enjoyable in terms of posing an even challenge and having fun. Certainly not everyone's cup of tea.",0
Negative,"UPDATE: There's a lot less instability/stuttering/fps drops, but they are still very much there, just not as aggressively and immersion breaking. Which is a good thing obviously, but the problem still stands. 60 fps cap, no ultrawide support. And also, the networking is fucking horrible. You wanna play co-op? Sometimes it'll work flawlessly, other times it'll never work, sometimes it'll work but some guy with 10,000 ping that is desyncing kills the host and himself with the network issues and co-op ends.Oh nyooo, but you can't separate co-op and pvp otherwise how will the toxic cunts be toxic.FromSoftware needs to stop making everyone so soft and stop catering to these virgin overlords. Either way, you do shit like this and people are just gonna make mods to go around it, so whatever.It's an amazing game. but. I'm rocking an i7-10700k OC to 4.8ghz with an RTX 3080 and I get framerate drops, instability, stuttering and memory leak. Sounds like the four horseman of terrible game launches.Not only that but there's a 60 fps cap and it can't even hold it up without lag? Cherry on top of that is no ultrawide support?Even though Dark Souls Remastered came with ultrawide support? We know you're able to do it, hell, even modders are able to do it, why can't you?Stop using consoles as a basis for development it makes no sense.EDIT: You can use Flawless Widescreen (JUST MAKE SURE YOU LOOK UP A GUIDE ON HOW TO DO THIS AND DISABLE THE ANTI-CHEAT AND STUFF, OTHERWISE YOU MIGHT GET SHADOW BANNED) to mod the game to turn ultrawide ON, it also comes with an FOV adjustment, an FPS uncapper, an option to turn vignette off, an option to turn chromatic aberration off and an option to increase animation distance (which you need ON if you want to play with ultrawide, otherwise npcs that are within the area that was now unlocked will have no animation and it'll look wacky. The main negative to this is NO ONLINE. You gotta take a few steps to ensure the game doesn't launch with anti-cheat and make sure you set the game in offline mode before doing all of it. I mean, who cares about souls pvp anyway. It's for sweaty nerds sitting on their gaming chairs with their doritos giggling at the monitor as they roll a group of casuals just having a good time and they look around their basement room to see no one around, alone and dark in this miserable underground, the giggling slowly stops as they look away from the monitor and notice they're alone, ugly and fat. They consider whether it's worth living like this, with no friends, no value to life or to themselves. They look at the bag of doritos and their awesome character build they found on YouTube and spent a whole week changing their own nappies to keep up with the meta and think, this is an appropriate life for them. Their grandma comes in with some baked cookies and they yell 'GOSH GRANDMA GET THE HECK AND FRICK OUT OF MY ROOM I'M PLAYING FRICKING ELDEN RING' and he throws his shit filled diapers at the wall and the grandma drops the cookies and runs away crying. The fat, sweaty, doritos covered nerd thinks to himself while he decimates at Elden Ring 'I am a true gamer, and everyone should respect me' as he's shitting himself to continue being a god tier Elden Ring player.Anyway, it's cringe that players who aren't even part of the official dev team figured out ultrawide and all the other fixes for PC within less than a month, meanwhile the devs are like ""HOR GORGE R. R. MARTEEEN WAOOOOW'. Yes, I know. Management/Corporate is probably a giant cocksponge, 100% responsible for all these fixes not being official and the developers did their best, so when people refer to the devs with this sort of thing, most of the hate should go to the higher ups that don't understand how it all works. Or maybe the actual developers should've made it a bigger deal, who the fuck knows, I'm not a developer. I'm just a cucked consumer who paid money for a product that a bunch of randoms fixed for free. Either way, cringe.",0

Negative,"This is a frustrating release, and a shame, because its game-play is excellent, but it's technical performance is woeful. For every high that it offers, like the thrill of exploration and the joy of slick combat, there's the lows of frame-rates plummeting far beyond any weaknesses of your hardware. Since every version, including the consoles, or beefy pc's, has stutter and serious hitches.I'm running this on lower specs than the minimum hardware, and yet after a driver update that got rid of intrusive graphical glitches, it's fairly smooth running this with high settings. They don't seem to be that much of a burden on the GPU, and even a 970 is capable of running some hefty outdoors scenes at between 45 to 60 frames a second. indoors can be pretty much a smooth 60 fps, but with very little happening onscreen it will tank to the low 40's, and on occasion plunge into the 20's. Undoubtedly some of this is my hardware, but it will drop with very little going on, and since this is known across the board, clearly something is fundamentally wrong with the engine. Performance seems like it should be fixable in time, so this negative review is purely a reflection of it's current state. It is far worse than any of their other games, and whilst it may be their response to a security problem discovered in their engine, if so it's had a disastrous effect on how it handles. If you persist with the game, as I have, well.it is generally playable, and it is a great evolution of the Dark Souls template. The world is huge but lacking in lore, this isn't a Skyrim type experience where you meet NPC's and they talk your ear off with tales of how they took an arrow to the knee. Verbal exposition isn't a big thing hereElden Ring is a third-person combat RPG, that is less focused on it's narrative and quests than more talkative titles like The Witcher 3. If you're familiar with Dark Souls this is a tweak and refinements to that experience in a much less linear manner than before. The open world is a quite liberating element for me. If you're unfamiliar: it's a responsive but measured mixture of melee and ranged options, with the player free to mix and match how they progress in a world that's a big playground for your skills. With the only limitation being that levelling up becomes harder and harder, and your proficiency in combat will be limited by your stamina, or how much magic you can cast, or number of arrows / crossbow bolts etc. Further tweaking of your weapons and armour can also boost your capabilities, so paying attention to what you have in your inventory is a big part to survival. It rewards choice, and whilst it lacks depth mechanically (whatever build you make, it doesn't really change the fact that most bosses are just simple combo's but hit really hard) it is very engaging trying to unravel it.You roam in one one direction and some beast or neer-do-well kicks your arse, so you travel elsewhere and some other beast or neer-do-well kicks your arse. And so on, and so on, until you come across something where you think to yourself ""I'm taking you down"" and maybe, just maybe you prevail and can start to level up. Once various abilities are learned or obtained by defeating bosses, it starts to flow more smoothly.Chipping away here and there to get enhancements, and then going back to some gargantuan fiend that smushed you in one hit before, and now you can have an epic battle that gets the adrenaline flowing rather than getting instantly squashed like an insignificant bug. That feeling is great, but you have to work to achieve it. You have to explore to find it's surprises and secrets, and often you will be left to figure out things for yourself. Which will either be great if you're a free-thinker, or bad I guess if you want your hand held and not to have to think.When the game opens up there is probably the best, smoothest example of this genre to date. Every facet of it's game-play is fine-tuned and beautifully executed. The tragedy is that the game really handles poorly enough, albeit on occasion, that it undoes the otherwise solid level of performance. There are times when tons of stuff is onscreen and it has no issue, then you can be walking down a corridor of a self-contained area and the frame-rate falls off a cliff for seemingly no reason.I honestly think that even with my 970 this will eventually see a patch, possibly when they can remove easy anticheat from being needed?, that will see a much more stable game. As it really feels like it ought to be better, since the game isn't that much of a looker, or doing stuff that other games couldn't manage at higher frame-rates. Compared to other open world titles like Mad Max / RAGE 2 / The Witcher 3 / even Monster Hunter World (which was dubious itself) this struggles keeping up.My expectation is that will change, but for now, as disappointing as it is, no recommended despite it being GOTY material when these problems are hopefully fixed. It is a great game, and also a bad one. For those who are made of sterner stuff, it is still quite playable, but no hardware no matter how powerful will resolve it's performance issues.",0

Negative,"I think the game is not bad and it should be played. The reason I am writing a negative review is that I am fed up with the stupid design choices that have been continuing since Dark Souls 1, and no one is talking about the obvious problems of Elden Ring. I will point out the game's flaws in my own way, hoping that maybe, even if it's just a small chance, other players will do the same, and they will make this quality game even better.The same classic silly setup that has been continuing since Dark Souls 1 persists in this game as well. The difficulty of completing NPC quests and coming across them let's admit it, 90% of players complete these quests by looking at guides. , but even if I overlook that, the progression of the quests is the same. We press the interaction button repeatedly with NPCs who stand like statues. After doing this three times in different locations, the NPC quest is completed. Sure, at the end of some quests we fight and so on, but the process is the same: press the talk button, then press it again at the next location, and continue. I wonder if anyone is genuinely affected by these mostly depressive NPC stories. There are no cutscenes or cinematic settings; they are just immobile statues. This needs to be improvedElden Ring has a much larger map compared to its previous games, but this beautiful and large map is filled with many repetitive bosses and identical dungeons even the creatures inside the dungeons are the same However, the thing that most undermines the sense of exploration is this: you're traveling in a location, defeating enemies specifically placed to frustrate the player, and the result? You are rewarded with crappy material or an item you won't even remember the name of. Instead of these useless items, they should include enemy armor sets, weapons, and items with different low drop rates. This would make the sense of exploration much more satisfying and save players from meaningless and unenjoyable grinding.:DThe bosses in Elden Ring are really great, both in terms of design, environment, and patterns. Generally, they are good, but it's clear that some are filled with unnecessary aoe damage and sometimes excessively high damage just to make the boss fight very difficult and frustrating for players. I'm not saying the bosses impossible to beat. I believe the aoe combos they should be balanced, and the damage they inflict should be slightly reduced.Despite its many flaws, Elden Ring is a high quality game, and I will continue playing it. If we as players criticize these obvious issues, we can indeed make this already high-quality game even better.",0
Negative,"The Short: I didn t really think what everyone was clamoring for was the Ubisoft-ification of Dark Souls. The Long: Pros-Jump Button?-Music-Horse Combat (mostly)*-Fun*-Addictive*Cons-Shockingly Laggy-Movement is Jank-The world seems very empty-Stamina consumption feels random-Graphics are often ugly and washed out-Ditches many of the better systems from previous games-Walked back some of the better ideas from the Network Tests-Flailing*-You need the wiki*-Where did my legs go?*- Why did my monitor stop working?*- It Crashed again* Mostly it s Dark Souls 3, but bigger and with extra tat tacked on, and yet somehow the whole thing feels a bit cheap. It s a big, mostly empty open world with dodgy traversal mechanics. The few hours I played were mostly hiding in bushes collecting flowers. The new sneaking around can be fun in an Assassins Creed way, but in the one camp I found, enemies tend to be in line of site of one another and the backstab is slow enough to leave you open. From what little I saw you can t really build a character around stealth. Before too long I found a gatehouse where the archer can spot you through cover and bosses/ boss adjacent monsters really won t let you get away with it like in the aforementioned Ubisoft sandboxes. Really, the game is done no favors comparing it to Assassins Creed as it s often a very ugly game. Assets pop in, creatures disappear, and all the colors feel very washed out. That s not uncommon for From Software games but from the character creation screen it looked like a marked improvement over DS3. Sadly, in game models are low rez, with larger ones having hard corners that show the limited poly count. Many assets seem to be copy pasted giving the whole experience a very cheap feel. Not helped by the fact that the Prolog is a Slideshow. Makes me wonder what could be causing all the lag. I don t mind dyeing in a Souls game, but when lag keeps killing me, I m gonna be a bit cross. It s very odd too, I have a pretty high end PC and can run much, much better looking games on ultra without issue. The early on, supposed to loose fight, bugged out so badly that the thing faded to black before I took any damage. It stayed that way long enough that I thought it had crashed, until I saw the loading symbol for an uncomfortably long time. That alone would be an issue worth waiting for a patch to buy, but the controls are janky too. There didn t seem to be analog sensitivity adjustment; so had to keep switching out controllers until I found one that didn t interrupt me walking across the room in a straight line. How could this have happened, they nailed this before? Yeah, so, the elephant in the room here is Sekiro(not just Sekiro, but we ll get to that). Traversal, Stealth and combat improvements miles above any of the Souls games were all there, but they ditched them for some reason. I m not saying we needed a Grappling Hook, but why make the jumps so awkward and imprecise? All the low ledges and walls seem to encourages jumping, but it s very unclear as to what can be vaulted over. Like Sekiro It does embrace the idea that movement doesn t consume stamina, sort of. It does when you re in combat, though that can be somewhat academic due to the poor stealth system and other factors I couldn t place. Sekiro also nailed parrying, blocking and Dodging. And by that I mean they were balanced enough so that they were all useful. The Perilous Attacks system was a spectacular way to engage foes. Unlike most Soulsborn games you really had to parry. Yet for some reason we are, for the most part, back to Dark Souls 3 style block, dodge and Parries so inexact your better off not bothering. Reviews keep saying it s a culmination of all From Software has learned, but it s seems more like a pick-n-mix of middling ideas. Even if you didn t want to pull from Sekiro for the combat why ignore the other games? The only presence from Dark Souls 2 seems to be the double weapons, nice to have, but hardly that game s best feature. They seem to keep doing this, Dark Souls was great for it s time, but Dark Souls 2 and Bloodborn greatly refined the formula. Yet Dark Souls 3 seems to have contained none of what made those games better, and here again. Here as in DS3 we are awash in samey Weapons, I though BB taught you a dozen well designed weapons are better then way, way too many swords. Parrying especially needed to look to these three titles. DS2 made nigh everything Parryable and gave you a big window to counter, BB made parrying at range possible and Sekiro made it fluid enough that it was always a strong option. Here we re back to DS3 s parrying is here but blocking or dodging is still more viable. In truth this game is proof to me they failed to learn from themselves, but they re not even looking to what their peers have done. During the Network Tests leveling Strength gave you the ability to wear heavier armor, as in the Nioh games(which let mutable stats dictate this), but they switch it back to only Endurance granting more carry weight. Why? It makes more sense for the Strength based character to have heavier armor. Strength scaling Weapons often have slower windups and longer punishes, as a result you may have to soak a hit to land a blow. It was a good idea; it had been proven to work in other Souls-Like games and they cut it out. On that note, where s the Rallying system got to? That was such a great feature I ve seen it crop up in many other games. Is it hidden somewhere in this overstuffed mess? I could go on, I played this game for about five hours and while it felt longer than that, I don t think I really got anywhere. In point of fact, I think I ve already gone on too long, but it s all kind of moot as my primary issue is that; it s just kinda boring. I mean, haven t we been here before? I ve never started a new From Software game and within hour I m reaching for a podcast. I want more Sekiro, more Bloodborn, heck I d even take more Dark Souls 2, but just don t want whatever this is. *Update After many hours I did get into it, the horse combat helped as it is, largely, very fun. But everything comes with a caveat. The mounted sections are good until you get arbitrarily knocked off your alpaca. Now that is admittedly annoying, but what s worse is there s nothing you can do about it. There s no barding you can equip on your beast and while the game says putting points into Dexterity helps keep you from falling off, I m at 60 Dex and I don t see much difference. Also, it would only sort of mater if there was a huge difference as you can t, as far as I can tell, actively do anything to increases your fluffy friends HP. Getting knocked off your horse is often instant death as you just lie on the ground for an age waiting to be mauled. It s not unlike you ve had the controller torn from your hand and it is held out of reach until you are ether killed or are obscenely low on health. And just to put a cherry on the alpaca manure Sunday, when your fine beasty does inevitably die, you have to use a health potion to revive them. by way of a menu prompt asking Are you sure you want to bring your only chance of survival back from the dead at the megger cost of one of your many, easily replenished items? . Yeah, I m pretty forking sure Elden Ring, except don t bother, because I died battling with your superfluous text box, again. Keeping with caveats the bosses are often quite fun, despite their copy paste nature, but some just won t let up. I d say learn their pattern, but that only maters if they ever take a break. Dark Souls 2 got critisised for having too many foes per encounter, but I ll take that over half of them having a HYPER COMBO. By far your best option is to find your favorite utterly broken Spell, Consumable, Ash of War, etc(there s no shortage) and use it as a crutch when the game decides to change the ru",0
Negative,"Wonderful at first, takes a nosedive once you start paying attention.If you're here to complain about me playing this game more after reviewing, someone in the comments pointed it out just fine: All the other souls games have no online features and I enjoy coop multiplayer. This game has gotten only worse the more I play it and I have finally uninstalled it. Fuck this piece of crap game.Honestly, my first 40 or so hours with this game were gorgeous. I loved riding around the open world on the horse just faffing about and seeing the sights, doing a small dungeon every now and then, and throwing myself at the first few main story bosses. Then as time went on things started to feel off. Bosses get copy pasted around, enemies get reused as mini dungeon bosses, mini dungeon bosses become ""normal"" enemies, and the further you get the more annoying the encounters become. Then it all culminates in Castle Sol, at which point my honeymoon phase with this game just crashed and burned ( although to be fair this was already starting around Leyndell), and I started to see this game for what it really is: A wonderful massive open world, filled with filler and copy pasted shite, with too few enemy types and bosses to populate even half the areas, and encounter designs that remind me of Dark Souls 2, where killing you is more important than creating a challenge.Balancing in this game is whack, the areas rarely fit your character's level, and half the builds are simply not viable in the later game areas, which was especially disappointing since From games like these kinda stand on the whole ""choose your own build"" principle. The game seems to try to fix this by throwing handfuls of respec items at you. Bosses have chain attacks that hit-stun you longer than their pause between attacks, animations have unintuitive delays and very clear roll-catch feints that were already annoying me in DS3, there's some attacks that wind up so slowly you can attack a boss multiple times between the opening tell and the attack going off, and damage done by the late game bosses and enemies is so stupendous that leveling vigor is now as important as leveling ADP was in DS2. You either do it or you don't get to play the game. Late game encounters are also not enjoyable at all. The later areas are usually filled with enemy spam, summoning enemies, enemies that have infinite stamina and aggression, high poise and ridiculous damage. Enemies hiding around each and every corner, very powerful miniboss enemies grouped up with jobbers, enemies that are programmed to try to push you off ledges. All of the childish ""haha we killed you"" things, and in the end I would prefer just running past the reused enemies since fighting them was not going to benefit me at all.One of the things about this game that annoys me the most is how it subtly lies to you about its own design. Malenia's healing strikes also heal when she hits your shield, which is entirely counterintuitive to a mechanic like that which usually works like lifesteal, where she heals when she does damage. Mohg's curse can be negated by a wondrous physik tear except the tear barely works, and he still gets to heal most of his health and do some damage, and you can't roll through any of the curse animations. There's some Hero's dungeons that have dark phantom versions of enemies you need to lure onto seals of holy light to undo their invulnerability, except using holy attacks *doesn't work on them* (this is especially annoying as From is expected to pay attention to detail, and reward observant players) (Both the Phantom and chariot versions of the Hero's dungeons are awful btw), and the Godskin Duo fight pretends to be Throne Watcher & Defender, where if you kill one the other summons them back, except if you kill both in quick succession they just get summoned back anyways, without either of them needing to execute a summon animation. I feel like mentally engaging with this game is just a waste of effort and since this is a Fromsoft game that is *incredibly* disappointing.This game could have been wonderful, but it collapsed under its own scope. The map is so big, and they wanted to fill it with so many small dungeons and gaols and encounters that they ended up having to copy even main story bosses (Mohg, Astel, Godrick, Loretta gets used twice, so does Margit, and Morgott is just Margit with some extra moves, same for Niall and O'Neill) just to fill them with. It's embarrassing, and this game is nowhere near as good as you'll hear in general discourse about it.As a bit of a qualifier I will add: I have beaten all the main bosses (Including Malenia), collected all of the Great Runes, put god knows how many hours into this game, and think I have a pretty *okay* grasp on most of the boss's patterns and timings. I have beaten the final boss(es), and the only boss I used online coop to beat was the (actual) Mohg fight (the one with the curse of blood) since I was simply not going to deal with that shit. I enjoy some things about this game. There are a few bosses that I find Magnificent. Radahn is one of the coolest thigns I've ever encountered (except they nerfed him for some reason.), Maliketh is an incredibly well designed boss, and lots of fun to fight, Godfrey and Radagon are also really good fights, and I still enjoy going back to help others fight them in coop, and I can safely say that I find the open world gorgeous to look at and still enjoy riding around it on the horse. Sadly the rest of the game exists around these good aspects, and drags everything down with it.-After thinking about it some more and reading some of the comments on this review I think I have some more thoughts to give. They are more on the technical and engine side of criticising the game. Since I'm running up against a character limit I will put them in a comment multiple comments to this review.",0
Negative,"I haven't yet completed the game, but I'm posting a review now because people need to know.The game itself is great but has issues not related to gameplay which degrade the experience so much that I honestly can't recommend this in it's current state.This unlike earlier From Software games, uses EasyAntiCheat which has been causing issues for many players, including myself. More often than not, the EAC popup shows but after that the game window never shows up. The only somewhat reliable workaround is to delete the EasyAntiCheat folder from inside the game's files (and the game's compatdata directory if using Linux) and then verifying the game's local files. Steam will then re-download the correct EAC files and the game should be able to launch.Other users have been experiencing different problems with EAC, such as crashes, getting stuck at a white/black screen and ""inappropriate activity detected"" errors etc without any good reason.If you are able to get the game started, you're faced with the second major issue, performance.Afaik, this is an issue on the PC version only, but nevertheless a major issue which needs to be fixed.Even on high-end hardware, the game fails to maintain a steady 60fps, especially in open areas. Sometimes the framerate drops down to 20-30fps in the worst cases. Only in some closed areas a steady 60fps is possible currently.This game deserves a thumbs up, but I can't give it before these issues are solved.EDIT: Seems like my savefile just got deleted. When I started the game I was only presented with a ""NEW GAME"" option in the main menu. No ""CONTINUE"" or ""LOAD GAME"" option in sight. So apparently that's a thing too.EDIT 2: Most of the game's performance issues have been solved, but not all and EAC is still causing the same problems as before.",0

Negative,"Not feeling the hype on this one. The game is fine. but it is still just another Souls game, with the same pluses and minuses. The world itself feels dead, somewhat the point I suppose, but it is bland, at least early on. Beyond that the graphics as a whole feel like they would have been adequate in early 2017 or so, definitely not today, what makes it worse is that the performance for these graphics is piss poor, 3080 cannot maintain 60fps, and the game has constant stuttering. The world itself looks much like any other game in the Souls series. Could just be me, but after fighting through a million ruined castles that all look alike since Demon's Souls came out, I'm rather tired of it, to be honest. The game is only for the Souls hardcore, in my opinion. It would have gotten a slight recommendation had the performance not been as god awful as it is, it's unacceptable in 2022 to have a PC game run this horribly from a major publisher. No Ultrawide or Superultrawide support is also just inconceivable to me in this day and age, yet here we are.",0

Some console player ?! My eyes just bleeding.- No keyboard + mouse icons- Terrible mouse sensitivity options- And then you see reviews all over the world 10/10. Funny",0
Negative,"I wish there was less open world stuff and more stuff like Stormveil castle. The open world and the terrible optional dungeons don't feel as though they have the same care put into them that larger legacy dungeons do. For such a ""large"" game, it seems to have the same amount of content in it as Dark Souls 3, just spread out a lot further. Hopefully more updates and DLCs come that round the game out and make things feel more complete. I can't really recommend it until that point.",0
Negative,"Shader cache loading issue still present in 2023, company shows no signs of fixing this issue despite this being a modern title released by a modern company. Essentially no matter your hardware this game will stutter due to poorly implemented shader loading. There is no guaranteed work around, some players will run this game smoothly on an i5 with a 3050, and some players will experience frame drops to 2 fps for 1 second every 5 seconds while running this game on a 4060 TI with 16 gb of ram. Valve was actually aware of this issue and fixed it for the steam deck version of this game, yet somehow over a year in bandai wont fix something as amateur as this. The content of the game is spectacular but to ignore the disgusting state of the port long after the initial release date is unfair to the total review of this game, and that is why I still cannot recommend this game despite it having the potential to be enjoyable.",0
Negative,"For a 16 rated game, this game is too easy. Also, everything looks like it's off of some childish baby show like fuckin Thomas The Tank Engine. As one of the rappers of all time, I say don't spend your money on this - just buy my new album: Donda 2. As always, thank you guys so much - we're the number one champion sound, yeah Estelle we bout to get down (get down). Anyways, back to Elden Ring; the elevators take a long time which really breaks the immersion. Moreover, I mean, let's all be honest with ourselves here: this game is clearly ripping off of Dark Souls. Funny thing is, this knock-off by some off-brand company is even worse than the souls series (WHAT?!). Overall, this game can suck my dick (not like Kim is doing that anymore so someone gotta step up) meaning this is my first Donda 1/Donda 2 I've ever had to give. Just a shocking performance.",0
Negative,"A game that only tells you after you purchase it, that you must agree to let them upload your ""browser network data"" to play it. What?! I totally get games that want to track harmless analytics or diagnostic data for quality improvements to their servers or to find bugs as they patch the game. What does a game developer need with ""browser network data"" though?!On principal alone, I kicked it back for a refund. If you care about the future of gaming, you should too. 14 day refunds are great, but Steam should quit allowing Developers to insert unadvertised usage agreements after the purchase. It's neither an honest, nor valid sale.This might, unfortunately, be one of the most promising game in the last year, but I'll wait for something better. The statement really says more about 2021 anyway. Perhaps the only reason I considered spending money on a Souls-like is because I'm apparently rebounding emotionally and trying to recover from the crushing disappointment that was Deathloop.",0
Negative,game doesn't work. and mid dlc except mesmer.,0
Negative,"Would have been a great game if it wasn't for the constant connection errors. Nothing more frustrating that having you friends failing to connect repeatedly or get a connection error mid co-op. A month of this and I am fed up. I know of 7 other people that are fed up for the same reason. So if you want a single player game, go for it but if you want to co-op don't even look at this game, they just can't support it and don't appear to be doing anything to fix it either. It would be great if they could sort out ultrawide support too.",0
Negative,"Currently cannot recommend this game at the moment (especially at its pre-order/launch price):- kinda buggy on PC atm (spent 30 mins fixing up controller support, no-ultrawide support, frames drop a bit and stutter even thought i have a RTX3070, AMD Ryzen 7 5800X, 64GB of RAM)- i get a bit of motion sickness from the game (even with motion blur disabled)",0
Negative,"Yeah.You've probably already heard all of the positive remarks about this game. I'm not going to spend much time marking down the things I do like about Elden Ring. But, it would be disingenuous of me if I didn't cop to something.In order:1. The Ashes of War system is cool and the build variety it opens up is great. There's a lot of room for player expression, moreso than previous titles and certainly more than Sekiro.2. Certain parts of the game are breathtaking, and the art direction is spot on for the most part.3. There's a LOT of weapons, armors, rings, etc etc. It's very easy to make your character look good and a lot of the unique weapons feel great to play with.4. Fighting boss (when it's done right) still feels pretty great. That feeling when you dodge at just the right time never gets old.Aaaand. That's kind of it. I'll be honest, it took a minute to scrounge up even that.I'm just going to go over the major elements that led to me scoring the game the way I did.THE WORLDI am incredibly critical of Open World games, perhaps to a fault. I've always struggled to find merit in these types of games, and they rarely, if ever, hook me in. The appeal for me of an open world is the prospect of a living world that I can get lost exploring in. Now, the open world concept is essentially the tagline of Elden Ring, and you spend an assload of time in it. So how does it shape up? It doesn't. Not even in the slightest bit. Now, the world isn't empty, let me make that clear ahead of time. Too often do critics of this game latch onto that word, and time and time again you'll see the fans counter with: ""No no! There's tons of stuff in the world, it's not empty at all!"" And they're right! There's plenty of stuff! The problem is that it almost all sucks.There's a lot content in terms of quantity. There's countless enemies, dungeons, and merchants. But it essentially all boils down to the same routine. In the overworld? Fight some trashmobs, loot some items. In a dungeon? Fight some trashmobs, loot some items, kill a boss (WOW!), leave. There's no narrative stringing you along through any of this locations barring the main quest, and there no towns or villages to relax or morp around in. The whole world of Elden Ring is a vast expanse of nothingness with a bunch of filler riding the coattails of the main story areas, lazily hidden by your horse. We've seen this formula time and time again in games from developers like Ubisoft, usually to much criticism. But is it really that much different here, when you pull away the Soulsy veneer? Ask yourself. If it weren't for Torrent, how alive would the world feel if you were stuck on foot?LEVEL DESIGNThe level design is not good. I'm going to piss off a lot of people by saying that, but it's true. The fundamental issue with the levels in Elden Ring is that there is virtually no reason at all to fight the enemies. Fromsoft's design philosophy coalesces into a perfect storm of shittiness a lot of the time, where the inherent risks of fighting enemies almost always outweighs any of the incentive to do so. The enemies respawn if you die even once, and the Runes you're going to get from the boss will far outclass anything you're gonna scrounge out of even 100 mangy dogs, so why not just run through the whole thing? Seriously? How is that not the OPTIMAL way to play? You're routinely presented with situations where you're outnumbered and entirely outclassed by the level enemies, and fans will tell you to fight. But why? You don't have to to progress. The only thing in the way of you getting to the next area is the boss. That always nagged me about Fromsoft games, and it's made even worse here with all of the magic spam and other teeth-pulling bullshit you have to put up with. You can't tell me that Benny Hilling around the map is good game design. You just can't. QUESTLINESThe quests in this game, if you can really call them that, are bad. They're very bad. The Souls series isn't really known for its arresting side characters or engrossing B-Plots, so this isn't too much of a shock, and normally wouldn't be a huge problem for me. The issue though is that the open world nature of Elden Ring mutates the already pretentious questing system of previous games into even more of a nuisance. Here's a breakdown of the only quest I bothered completing: (with the help of a guide)1. Meet Yura Bloody Finger Hunter underneath a bridge at Limgrave Lake.2. He warns you about the dragon. This is the only thing he does, and there is no indication whatsoever of any kind of quest related to him.3. Ride clear across the lake into a random ravine. Get dismounted off your horse and fight some bloody-finger guy. Yura spawns in and then says some random dialogue about the guy you're fighting while you mash him.4. Despawns, and then reappears at the very end of the ravine in a cave. Again, no indication whatsoever about where he's at.5. Talk to him. He congratulates you and purrs at your martial prowess and then warns you about some crazy lady named Eleonora. Quest over!6. Wrong. There is now a summon sign clear across the map in Raya Lucaria at the end of a broken bridge (yes, you read that right).7. Use the summon sign, fight some random NPC with Yura. Get sent back on the bridge and be careful not to miss him! as he's now leaning on the railing behind you.8. Talk to him, get an Ash of War. Quest done!9. Wrong! Again! He teleports clear across the map. again. to a random church in the Atlus Plateau. This time you find him sprawled out near-death on the church floor, giving an opera-monologue about his beloved Eleonora. You stand around awkwardly waiting for him to croak, then loot the sword off his still-warm body.10. Just as you're about to leave, Eleonora spawns in. Gasp! You fight her and then get a pole-staff.11. Quest done! Does that not sound like the stupidest fucking thing you've ever heard in your entire life? This appears to be the standard of Elden Ring's quests. 0 direction, 0 investment, and -0 idea about what the fuck is going on. The way they're designed prevents you from ever really being the active agent in any of the quests you undertake. You're not experiencing the beats of a quest because you intend to, they kind of just happen to occur if you're in the right place at the right time, and if Mercury is in retrograde and the North Star is *juuust* bright enough. Coupling that with the fact that there's no actual decision-making expected on your part, you get the comedic impression that you're just some dipshit extra at the school play, who's so good at getting in the way that the actual actors in the show have to improvise some on the spot nonsense to keep the whole production from being torn down by your meddling. I actually busted up laughing when Yura died. It almost feels intentional.CONCLUSIONThere's a lot of other stuff I could touch on but I'm already out of space here so I'll keep this brief. If you like all of the other Souls games, you might like this. I don't for all the reasons above. Am I going to keep playing it though? Yeah, probably. Am I going to like playing it? Mmmmmm. Probably not.",0
Negative,"TL;DR version: excellent early game, polished combat and fun exploration brought down by badly designed late game ripe with blatant reuse and encounters made frustrating on purpose unless you're using a broken build or using the new ""spirit ashes"" system to summon your own adds to the fights. Would've been an easy thumbs up if it was half as long with half as much content being reused and BS mechanics toned down.Currently this feels like a 6-7/10 title or a ""maybe"", with early game at 8-9/10, mid-game at 7/10 and late game at 3-4/10.Full version:Elden RIng is hard to review. It's both the hardest and easiest game in the series, and simultaneously the most fun and the most frustrating entry in From's catalogue.The first half of the game (~40-60 hours) is very good. Stormveil castle is a very fun dungeon, among the best in all Souls games. Early bosses are great, too: difficult but fair, and the game gives you a lot of choice in how to approach them. Multiple optional areas are available for players who want to improve their characters before tackling the ""main story"" bosses. Even the optional bosses, found in various side dungeons and open world of the game, are well-designed and don't feel unfair despite their difficulty. Lots of fun weapon choices are present, as well (some much stronger than others, balance of the game is still being worked on, as clearly shown by the recent 1.03 update). A few shortcuts (which, for newer players, may feel like deadly traps) exist to circumvent the natural order of progression and get some powerful upgrades and experience boosts early on, which is cool for repeated playthroughs and challenge runs.It also just feels nice to play: both traversal and combat feel great now that you're able to jump, resulting in a proper ""3D"" feel. Going back to older From games right after this one really makes you realize how stiff they feel.So why the negative review, then?It all goes south in the second half of the game, when you get hit by the full extent of content reuse and silly inflation in numbers. You'll start feeling it by the time you reach Atlus Plateau, and it only gets worse from there.Someone else did the math and there are 8 (eight) - ok, 11 (eleven) if you count the drastic phase changes - non-reused bosses in the whole game. Now consider that there are more than 100 bosses in Elden Ring, meaning 90% of your playtime is tackling reused content in some form. Some of these also make absolutely no sense at all, too: even the main story, ""shardbearer"" bosses, and final bosses of long quest chains spanning almost the whole game, get reused as ""optional"" content. Two of the main story bosses are, in fact, fought again in the main story, although the fights are changed somewhat, either getting extra moves or extra phases.What's worse, From pulls their ""early bosses as trash mobs"" card on an unprecedented scale. Without any exaggeration, every single boss enemy you encounter in early game dungeons later gets encountered as a regular enemy or, sometimes, as a duo gank-type boss fights. Some of the bosses you will fight 4-5 times throughout the game, with gradually increasing HP and damage, but nary a change to their moveset.Surely, at least the non-repeated bosses must be great and spectacular, yeah? Well, about that: - One mid-game boss, the epitome of macho brute force spectacle, was nerfed in 1.03 update and was lauded as one of the worst fights in Souls series before that because of long and very damaging combos and some 1HKO moves with insane tracking which are made hard to read because of the bosses' size relative to the player. - One late game boss is fought in an arena with multiple pillars that you'd expect are there to help break line of sight. Unfortunately, that doesn't stop the boss from attacking and at least one of the moves he has ignores line of sight completely and will hit you from behind a pillar.- Another late game boss has, according to a dialogue line, ""has never known defeat"", and therefore comes with an ""I win"" move which can only be consistently avoided using a specific Ash or being far enough away from the boss to be able to outrun the ability when it's used. Otherwise, if you're too close your survival is up to RNG. The boss can and will use this ability multiple times during the fight at seemingly random points in time. The boss will additionally heal a couple of hundred HP when landing any hit, even if blocked with a shield.- Yet another late game boss comes with guaranteed 3-hit attack which can either be healed through (-3 uses of Estus flask) or ignored completely if using a special item obtained in a completely unrelated area of the game, and usually either several hours before or several hours after first fighting this boss. Additionally, these 3 hits heal the boss for 30-40% of its HP, regardless of whether the mechanic is ignored using the item or not.- One more late game boss will use a homing missile type of ability that persists for ~15 seconds, continously following the player and dealing small but almost unavoidable damage. The boss will continue using its normal moves at the same time, so have fun multitasking.FInally, many bosses in this game are obnoxious in their love to delay their attacks and input read the player to punish dodging and healing. In some cases, the delay is so bad (3 or 4 seconds, you can roll 3 times and the attack will still be charging) that you'll start doubting whether the animations are being artifically stretched - and then they're followed by a sped-up hit which is usually too fast to avoid reactively. These same bosses also have plenty of normal fast attacks, too, so I can only assume that the ridiculous delays were added specifically to throw off the player's sense of timing and rhythm. It's ok in theory and has been used cleverly in other From games, but never overused to the extent they are here. Get ready to face patterns that look like ATTACK - ATTACK - ATTACK - ATTACK - ATTACK, in one combo, followed by a one second opening until the boss switches to the next combo.All of this is, of course, easily ignored if summoning Spirit Ashes, which gives you a (sometimes, very powerful and almost capable of soloing the boss on its own) extra in the fight at no penalty (unlike normal coop summons which raise the bosses' HP). Some overpowered builds are also available to let you easily break the game, but those are gradually being nerfed judging by 1.03 changes. Seeing how at least one of the bosses who had obnoxious and unfair mechanics was also nerfed, maybe we're all playing a beta test and the game will be in a much better shape after a few months? Not sure that I'll have another hundred of hours to test that, though. But at least in the current state, Elden Ring's lategame as a solo melee character not using Spirit Ashes is an exercise in frustration (and I stayed away from using Spirit Ashes for a very long time, only using the ability on three bosses in the game).Exploration, which starts off very strong, also becomes almost unexistant by the end: locations feel increasingly more empty the closer you are to the end of the game.On the technical side of things, after the initial performance issues were fixed in the first couple of patches, the game ran smooth as butter at 1440p@60 fps on my 9700K/3070 rig. The game crashed a few times when invading other players in the first week since release, but I haven't experienced any crashes since then.Overall, Elden Ring feels amazing early on and is definitely a huge step forward for the series. Alas, in its second part, the game overstays its welcome and, instead of providing organic challenges, attempts to frustrate on purpose with unfair difficulty and encounters that are simply not fun to play against, bringing the overall experience down and making it hard for me to recommend in its current state.",0
Negative,"So while I do really love this newest open world soulsborne game and getting killed over and over again, this PC port has got to be one of the worst PC ports from them and in its current state it's hard to recommend this to anyone who isn't already a fan of these games.From incorrect button prompts if you're using K&M to co-op that barely functions half the time, complete lack of ultrawide monitor support, to probably the most egregious thing for me at least, especially after patch 1.03, causes constant stuttering/pausing for upwards of a second constantly while I'm playing, even when I'm just looking at the map and this stutter in a game that's all about timing and the rhythm of the enemies really screws with the gameplay.Honestly, it's a wonderful game but is just so marred by technical issues that I would not recommend this to anyone who isn't already a big fan of From Software's games and it would be better to wait for a sale or check up on the forums to see if the technical issues have been addressed.",0
Negative,"pros:1. good exploration2. spells and miracles in this game looks awesome nglcons:The boss fight sucks. so many 1 shot moves. that's not a good design, that's lazy and cheap. no, you cant tell me to ""git gud"" when you have 30ish vigors and the boss still 1 shot you.From the previous fromsoft game that i played (ds3 and sekiro): Slave knight gael, the twin princes, isshin, owl, and many more. that's great bosses.also at the end of the day, what you want is satisfaction after you defeat the bosses. i dont feel anything when i beat bosses in this gameupdated: i played more until i beat the infamous malenia. and holy fuck. a boss who moves that fast does not belong to a souls game. it's like you face a sekiro boss while you move like a normal souls character.also.Failed attempt at dual bosses (yes, i'm looking at you, godskin duo) for reference, demon prince, smough&ornstein, headless ape. that's how you do a good dual bosses, while 1 boss is aggressive, the other one still attacks you, but at a slower pace. meanwhile dual bosses in this game is. both of the bosses attacking you aggressively at the same time. yes it's harder. but is it fair? no.my overall review still standsoverall: 6.5/10",0

Negative,"Till they fix various bugs and optimization regarding extreme weather effects, can't really say I'd recommend this game to anyone who actually wants to play co-op. You literally don't know what bug you'll run into next. My wife's save file is forever bugged from obtaining resources in mines, as they can't be collected. We figured out how to repeat the bug, and it involves playing co-op the moment you can and then going out towards that dungeon, dismissing, going inside to find that you can't loot anything. Other bugs like the Raya Lucaria boss not having its shield active with 3 players, and the singing enemy to kill not being there. Every time we do a dungeon we're just waiting for the next thing to break and its just not fun.",0
Negative,"This is the Game of the Year, but I can't ignore the fact I'll have play sessions where my game crashes once per hour.It doesn't matter how beefy your rig is, there will be performance issues. This is an amazing game, so if you can handle that then go for it. I believe even gamers who have never enjoyed the Souls game will fall in love with this game. Just like Monster Hunter: World was more accessible and brought more QoL features to the Monster Hunter franchise, Elden Ring is that with Dark Souls. But if you can, wait a few months for them to patch it up. Reviewers should not be handing out 10/10 scores when they are not incorporating performance as apart of their reviews.Will update my review when they address these in future patches.",0
Negative,"One step forward, two steps back.I'll start by addressing the elephant in the room. You have 300 hours in the game, how can you not recommend it? . Well, let me do a breakdown of how those hours were spent.150 hours - duplicating progress in my own world for sections that I already did with a friend.80 hours - riding around the open world and fighting copy-pasted enemies; exploring dungeons and fighting copy-pasted bosses and enemies.40 hours - the actual fun part of the game, legacy dungeons. These areas follow the format of the previous souls games and feature carefully-crafted, closed-off areas with interesting enemies and well-designed bosses.30 hours - arena PvP, invasions, co-op with randoms.So overall, that makes 70 hours of fun content, and 230 hours of filler. If you re planning to buy this game to play with a friend, be prepared for a 7:23 ratio of fun to filler content. Now, I d like to get into my criticisms with the game itself.Open World: The open world is honestly really beautiful and engaging in the first 3 areas, Limgrave, Liurnia, and Caelid. You won t be able to explore it as intended on a horse while playing in multiplayer, but that s not a big deal. These first areas have a good amount of content packed into them, and you ll be seeing enemy varieties for the first time, so you won t be bored of them yet. The problem begins 1/3 of the way into the game, at Altus Plateau. This area is really beautiful as well, and probably my favorite visually, but you will start to notice some really empty areas and a lot of copy-pasted enemies in the open world. After you get through Leyndell, you arrive at the worst part of the game - the Mountaintops of the Giants. This area has, I think, one single new enemy that is not just copy-pasted from the previous areas with a different skin. It s not even worth the words to describe how bad this area is. If you buy the game despite my negative review, here s some advice: hop on your horse and ride straight to the boss, because there s nothing worth exploring here. Right after this is another empty snow area, but the devs use an innovative trick here - most of the area is covered in a snowstorm. This expertly hides the areas that they didn t have time to finish, so you can t see how devoid of content they are.Multiplayer:First of all, the netcode for this game s multiplayer is absolute trash. Connecting to your friends fails or hangs about 10% of the time, and invading requires you to use the item 1-30 times before you ll successfully invade someone. As far as anyone can tell, Fromsoft is basically still using the same netcode that they used back in Dark Souls in 2011, just with a couple of bandaids thrown on top to prevent infinite backstabs. Latency is a huge decider of every fight you will have, and a lot of the skill comes from being able to quickly identify the approximate ping difference between yourself and your opponent, and adapting your tactics accordingly.Your skills at PvE will not carry over at all. In PvE, you can look at an enemy s attack and decide to press dodge if you think it will hit you, but in PvP, you have to press dodge anyways no matter where their weapon is because of the invisible hitboxes and latency. On top of this, Fromsoft decided to make the latency issues even more prominent by introducing powerful status effects that build up on you even if you successfully dodge an enemy attack. The top level of PvP is full of Scarlet Rot and Sleep status abusers who exploit the fact that these status effects build up on you even through dodges, and the counter for this is to duplicate items (cheating) which cure Rot/Sleep in the middle of combat. Oh, and if you want to turn their tactics around on them, then you ll need to duplicate items too, because the sleep and rot grease are both limited in the quantity that you can obtain legitimately in a single playthrough. Watching a high-level invasion honestly makes me laugh with how many limited-use items both players are popping like candies. PvP is just laughably broken.On top of this, there are some multiplayer decisions made by the developers that cannot be described as anything other than stupid. First of all, co-op requires an item to even be allowed to summon people. In the early game, you ll have to waste some time farming for flowers (and probably 10 minutes trying to figure out why you can t summon, until you look it up). Next, if you kill a boss, you can t summon your friend anymore or be invaded in that area. If you kill all the bosses in a particular open-world chunk , then that whole area is off-limits for multiplayer. When you kill a boss anywhere in the world, even if it s just a random dragon in the open-world, you will be sent home as a cooperator. There are random fog-walls preventing you from entering caves with your friend, and you ll have to disconnect, ride to that spot in your own world, enter the cave in your own world, then re-connect to your friend (logical, right? It obviously improves the gameplay).Finally, even when everything is working properly and the networking issues aren t getting in the way, Elden Ring co-op is just horribly balanced. After the first couple of early-game bosses, every challenge in the game starts to become easy. Most enemies are simply not coded well to deal with multiple players attacking them. Bosses will change targets anytime they take damage, even if it s a tiny throwing knife, meaning that aggro-juggling is incredibly easy. The bosses are supposed to be able to kill you by damaging you and then punishing you when you try to heal, but with aggro-juggling, you will always be able to heal unless you mess up horribly and get killed in a single combo. This does happen, so co-oping bosses can still take a few tries, but the difference between multiplayer and singleplayer is night-and-day. Despite the fact that the game increases enemies health in co-op, the game is at least 3 times easier. To try to compensate for that, my friend and I turned on the Taunter s Tongue to attract invaders, but the game was still too easy, because it s incredibly hard for an invader to fairly beat 2 people. If you try invading, you will probably walk into a blender of 3 people spamming spells and ashes of wars and die in 0.5 seconds. This means that the only people who are left invading at higher levels, the only people who can manage to have fun within this framework, are the players who are willing to use any tactic necessary to win. Be prepared to deal with lots of duplicated rot grease, duplicated Starlight Shards, snipes from across the map with duplicated Golem arrows, and nuke builds that can kill you if you make a single mistake. I don t even blame the players who are using these tactics, because without them, there would be no invaders at higher levels. The game is simply so broken that players are forced to resort to these tactics to have a >0.5% chance of winning invasions.Story:The story is mostly incomprehensible if you rely solely on playing the game. You have to watch Youtube videos to have any idea of what s going on. After watching some, though, I came to this conclusion:Every one of the main players is a greedy cunt. George R. R. Martin tried to craft a complicated story, but the gameplay just doesn t support it. Imagine Game of Thrones, but there are no background civilians in the story. It s just the lords and ladies fighting over empty castles full of monsters. That s Elden Ring. Every single creature attacks you on sight, and there are no visible civilians. You are fighting to become the Lord of ashes.Overall, the game is alright, but it s simply not a good way to spend your time. It all comes back to the 7:23 ratio of fun to filler. Maybe others will find that to be an acceptable ratio, but I don t. I wish I could get back the hours that I spent on this game, and I implore others not to make the same mistake that I did.",0
Negative,"Elden ring is the true PRO GAMER experience, since most enemy go in and out invisibility at will. Enjoy guessing were they are and when you'll get ganked by an invisible monster!10/10 truly an epic fantasy moment",0

Negative,"bad optimization, game doesn't even close properly when you close it, random disconnects in multiplayer, unbalanced pvp",0
Negative,DLC completely ruined PvP for now. It didnt get review bombed enough it should be overwhelmingly negative,0
Negative,"This is literally dark souls 4 but in an open world.Yes, i knew what it would be and still bought it. Still, it is a step back from sekiro which tried at least something new.",0
Negative,"Unacceptable performance, stuttering ahoy and frame drops, often from nothing going on. Hopefully it's patched but for now, I cannot recommend this game.Update, nine months later: From did some work to patch things up but I still find performance disappointing, with frequent drops down to the 30s fps. My review remains the same, especially as it looks like they're just abandoning it after releasing a patch that made the game look worse.",0
Negative,"Definitely the worst FromSo game in terms of bosses. The design for most of them is really cool and creative but the playabilty is awful, lot of unfair special moves, lot of shit hitboxes (even tho they improved since the last games) and almost every single boss repeats at least once. what is the point of having an amazing and beautiful world if ur gonna fill it with the same shit every time.TL:DR if ur new to these kind of games play it, its amazing, exploration is really cool, music is great and its not that hard as the past games if ur an old fan of Dark Souls/Bloodborne this is a mediocre entry (7.5 imo)",0
Negative,"GREAT GAME!NOT CO-OP. so yeah. I absolutely love the game and reccommend it for single player. But not Co-op. It is not co-op and never really will be unless the devs open the entire world for co-op and not require you to farm a bunch of flowers to re summon your friend. They will also need to allow you to play your character fully in your friends world . Nor is it an ""online"" multiplayer game too. I really love the game but i feel this needs to be clarified that this is in no way a co-op game, you literally can only show up for bosses, and if you wish to continuously play with a friend, you will need a pile of summoning materials. 10-10 would reccommend for single player, and NOT for multiplayer.",0
Negative,"Was hyped up at first, open world is big, beautiful and rich for activities.But then I saw something I hoped to never see again.Remember what they did a few times when they had no money left in their pockets while devepoling Dark Souls 2? Take a boss, or even an ordinary enemy with buffed stats, and copypaste it twice in the same tiny room. Cheap, awful, stupid.But this time it doesn't looks like it was money problem.",0
Negative,"Not a fan, and bad performance.",0
Negative,The new stutter mechanic is quite transformative.,0
Negative,"Coming to this as someone who only really liked Dark Souls 1 (and even then hated the DLC with the exception of Artorias) after an initial open world honeymoon this has become the parts of Dark Souls I hate: just huge hyper-aggressive bosses who rampage around constantly or ""slightly larger than normal"" knights who generate huge AOEs out of thin air.It's also got a mostly-empty open world that is sometimes pretty but also a lot of times has large swathes of cut and paste environment.Underwhelming rewards for everything from combat to exploration, not great UI, not great map, not great netcode (2 disconnects out of 4 attempts), pointless crafting, absolutely flooded with unfunny meme soapstone messages, the ""lore"" is just a find and replace on Dark Souls. it's oooooooooookay but I really don't think it's anything special at all.I'll take that clown award now.",0
Negative,"My main problem with elden ring is that this game is sekiro/bloodborn speed without the mechanics that make sekiro/bloodborn work.Enemies are so fast and relentless with their attacks and you have very, very slim chances to actually fight back. This is particularly noticeable on the later bosses where they have these insane 5-9 hit combos that they then have less than a two second punish window before they launch off into another chain. They also have way more health than most bosses in DS3 on average and most of them can instantly kill you even with a pretty hefty investment into health.If you had the rally mechanic from Bloodborn or the deflect from Sekiro this game would be completely different, as it is the game punishes you severely for being aggressive with the completely over-tuned damage of the later bosses. This tends to really impact colossal weapons more severely than it does faster weapons due to the fact that so many openings are so short you might not even get a single swing out safely after dodging 6-10 attacks.What this does to combat is essentially makes the optimal way to fight anything simply to passively dodge all the attacks and only go for the punish when you know for a fact its free damage, but since the enemies are so aggressive and have such long chains you'll find yourself spending the majority of most fights just dodging over and over again.Players insist you can balance this with the summons since they are meant to be part of the balance for the game, but what self respecting fromsoft fan is going to WANT to use summons to beat the game? The entire point of the game, and the dev's have said this, is for everyone to be on the same level as far as difficulty. Well if that's the case why are the summon ashes so bloody strong and have zero downsides? Clearly a mage player with a summons is not having the same time as a melee player with an UGS. They literally betrayed their own design philosophy with this system and the result is that the bosses are hilariously over-tuned against a single target.Again, if I could deflect attacks, if I could regain hp lost trading hits, if I could do anything besides just spending 90% of the fight rolling around waiting for my turn to hit back this would be a very different game.My other major problem is the absolutely unacceptable amount of recycled bosses. This game has 165 bosses and maybe 10 of them are not reused. The dragons are reused 6 times, the erdtree avatar is reused 13 times! That's insane to have a single boss be reused that many times.",0

Negative,"-Update after 370 hours and patch 1.06:ER pvp is garbage, passive poise was a mistake and everything deals too much damage, status effect buildup still not fixed after 13 years, completely retarded weapon balancing and insane viability gaps between weapons, retarded spell balancing, garbage netcode, still no dedicated roll button, movesets still suffer from the same issues as in previous releases, either weapon is good by virtue of range / moveset / startup frames or it is hot garbage, lack of ultrawide support despite the game rendering behind those thick black bars on the side of your screen.They fixed BHS, fixed the helmet swap HP glitch. And the game is still an absolute shitshow PvP wise. At this point I give up on this game, because they will not remove passive poise, they will not revisit weapon movesets and improve them / balance them out and will not revisit the idiotically strong status effect procs. Stay away from this game if you were hoping you could have fun with the PvP here. PvE is imo the best aspect of this game, but the PvP seems like a tacked on afterthought. -Update after 300 hours and patch 1.05: None of the performance issues were fixed or even adressed, PASSIVE POISE, bloodhound step still has not been removed, connectivity issues during multiplayer since release, massive viability gaps between builds/weapons/spells, lack of consistent counters to shields, UI still garbage, no dedicated roll button after 13 years, input lag, huge input buffer, input drops, status effect buildup on dodge in pvp still present after 13 years. Just basically the standard garbage we all know and hate from previous games. Did I mentioned that they reenabled PASSIVE POISE?I could go on and on. To sum up, massive disappointment. And nothing will get fixed most likely. Classical Japanese company culture, where their PP will fall off sooner than they admit they fcked up and actually fix the issues with the game.This game, underneath the great artstyle, atmosphere, lore, cool characters. underneath it all, the gameplay, the technical aspect. you can see a testament to FS laziness, ineptitude, gross incompetence and ignorance of what makes their own games great from a gameplay perspective. I really wish Miyazaki was forcibly restrained exclusively to the PvE content / artstyle direction and Yui Tanimura was responsible for LITERALLY EVERYTHING ELSE. Bloody disappointment. -Updated after 40 hours of playing. This game is everything and more. Still, my negative review stands, until they will fix the technical issues. This is a preliminary review after around 9 hours of playtime. I've purchased the game without watching any prior reviews / videos / trailers. I still think the game is well worth the money, but what Fromsoftware has done with the PC port is disgusting and should have no place after years of continued support from the PC player base, especially with such a major release. To give you further context, my RIG is a 5900X, 3800Mhz 32GB DDR4, 5700XT - Game installed on a Corsair MP510 gen3 NVME. Keep this in mind when reading through the negative points. Let's start with the positives, PvE content wise: + Trademark Fromsoftware attention to detail / world building+ Fenomenal art style / art direction+ The storyline is mysterious, interesting, and 90% of the time you have no f***** idea what is going on. 10/10. + Completly badass enemies and bosses, very fun movesets to learn and counter - I think any souls veteran or newcomer will appreciate them.+ Perhaps the best level design in all of From's titles. + Platforming is actually fun for a change. Changes to gameplay and other observations related with it:+ You can change weapon arts, so in a way you customize your moveset.+ Jumping attacks are viable AND fun AND can be redirected in a 90* arc. + It feels like the movesets have more directional freedom compared to DS3 (feels almost familiar to DS2) + Lock on works like a heat-seeking missile, DS3-esque.+ New mechanic - Sneaking - It's fun to sneak up on groups of enemies or to sneak in bushes in an invasion.+ Powerstancing seems to me more than enough to be considered viable in a PvP setting,- Dualwielding is still dead - unless you powerstance, you have no running/heavy attack for the left handed weapon,+ New mechanic - Block countering - It's useful in PvE, but I have doubts that it'll be of any use in PvP whatsoever, unless they make the counters come out faster than the R1 followup. + The way the netcode has been handled seems to be the best rendition yet when the connection is good. + Inclusion of easy-anti cheat, so, maaaybe goodbye script kiddies? Mules will most likely be still possible, though. + The PvP scaling seems to be doing an alright job of evening out the playing field, so. goodbye twinks? - Nonsensical input chaining, a certain feeling of rigidness or clunkiness - the game will not let you override a que'd R1/R2 attack when you clearly try to dodge. + You don't get three-manned constantly when invading.My initial thoughts are that the PvP is pretty fun in a casual setting - Though I see some things could get out of hand in competitive settings - then again, trying to treat these games in a competitive way is a mistake in my opinion. But whatever floats your boat. The negatives (in order of most to least important in my eyes): - Lack of 21:9 support for a major release in 2022. - Major performance issues that include sporadic stuttering that can basically render the game unplayable for you. They happen at random. So if you're in a sweaty situation, you can die because of it. - Absolutely terrible input lag / input recognition on the dodge button - You're much better off setting up a macro for dodging than trying to understand how the inputs in the game work. 30ms delay between button press and release is good enough to make it consistent and snappy in my experience - but again - why do you need to set up a macro for dodging when it was not an issue in previous games? This only applies for the dodge button, as attack buttons work as they should. - The UI is a major pain to navigate on M/KB. The funniest part is, DS2 did it right, yet this game (and DS3) fails to properly make the UI usable with M/KB. So, one step forward, two steps back? - UI by default shows controller prompts instead of detecting M/KB. To reiterate once more - this game is everything and more. Just fix the technical issues and it might be the best game of the decade. I was looking for a single word to pinpoint my feelings about this release on PC. And I think I have it. It is a fucking disgrace. I expected better from Fromsoftware, after years of bad ports, that they would actually give a shit about the PC release.",0
Negative,"It's a good game, I like it a lot. It may have lots of problems but easily better than Miyazaki's games with ""Souls"" in the title.I'm downvoting it as a promise to a 2001 Ford Excursion.",0
Negative,Absolutely no reason this game should perform so poorly given my rig. Micro stutters so bad it triggered me to have a migraine last night. This is an incredible disapointment.,0
Negative,"You block/roll a string of 12 attacks with the bosses flailing and jumping and flipping and breaking your target lock, you see they've probably finished their string and try to get in one R1, but little did you know there was an unreactable delayed AOE explosion at the end of the string to punish your attempt to get the tiniest bit of damage. Or maybe they fling their sword up in the air for twelve seconds and catch you rolling with some absurd, clearly-designed-to-fuck-with-you delay. Which boss did I just describe? Most of them. The only advancement to your moveset in this game from Souls is the ability to jump, and almost no enemies use that as a mechanic. Every weapon art that isn't bloodhound step or raptor is virtually useless against the bosses. Torrent isn't available for bosses often enough, and is often straight up worse than being on foot. You don't get to do anything cool, the boss just does all the cool shit to you. These bosses would be way more fun in a game that expands what your character is capable of, like Sekiro, Nioh, or Monhun. I've beaten the game four times, and just finished the DLC. I'm not bad at the game. They've just cranked up boss health bars and damage and movesets to an absurd degree, and left the player character with the same roll, block and attack they've been using since Demon's Souls.Now that I'm done with the DLC, I'll probably never boot up and replay this game ever again, which is a shame. I want to love this game, it's just too much of a fucking slog to ever do again.",0

Negative,"the game is very good (so far, 10~ hrs in), the pc port is atrocious.- no fov/camera settings- no ultrawide support- invasive anticheat system that prevents above issues from being fixed - theyve been fixed by modders already, but you can only play offline if you dont want to get banned by the easy anti-cheat crap- stuttering problems; im not experiencing these because i have a fat system, but can be a problem with lower specs (just got big slowdowns during one specific mini boss)edit/ seems like some people are having problems with xbox controllers too.my review is negative just because these issues. the game itself is AMAZING and if you don't care about all these things and you intend to play with controller you will like it, otherwise prepare for a lot of tinkering.i enabled comments in this review so you can enjoy the crybabies raging and crying down there.",0
Negative,"I don't see many reviews talking about the negatives of this game, so I will start with that. I am very addicted to almost every FS game so I think my review will be interesting :).*** SPOILER FREE ***Cons :I know From Soft has always been reusing assets and im okay with that. what im not okay with is them over killing it a bit.i've killed the same bosses in this game so many times im sure I can remake half of the damn bosses myself from memory, its actually so bad that me and my friend were able to run into the same boss three times in a row. What I don't understand is why they dont reuse things from other souls games, I only notice a few clothing items that are reused but not bosses? like imagine if you could fight Lady Maria in this game. crazy! but no, you will really just fight a gargoyle 100 times in a row.getting souls in this game is like trying to live in America during the great depression, you get more later in the game but you really struggle to level at the start its VERY annoying.quest lines have always been my favorite part of these games, but for some reason in this game its a absolute nightmarethey try to help by having this little yellow circle on the side of your screen whenever you're in a area with the next part right? but the npcs really just go ""alright, go here and do this"" like I have no idea where the fuck that is? OR things will happen that confuse me. problem I had with a quest. before I finished Ronnie's questline, I was doing one for Sulavis that had me poison one of the npcs that had helped me with a boss beforehand, it was as simple as taking it to the npc and having her drink it, well when I went to her she declined the drink because shes ""too strong"" (lol) and just dipped, never to be seen againand Sulavis just kept saying the same damn thing after as if ive done nothing, eventually he died towards the end of Ronnies questline but i couldnt buy anything from him during that time. they have almost 0 direction but inside other souls games they are just alot more simple. why can't I use my horse when im with a friend? what if I want to explore the open area with my friend? we have to run for years? really? and give it to the invader too. jousting duels would be CRAZY!also invasions should really be able to invade anybody, not just coop games thats really lame.lastly, im sure you have all heard it is the performance. now I dont have a rtx 30billion or anything but I do have a strong pc. I really dislike going from a solid 60 to 30, and sometimes 18hell one time it kicked me out the game because my frames weren't high enough. like ?I also really like how the quests work. Its wonderful how half of them don't even work or one mistake means lets go NG. yes I know that was in older souls games but this is a OPEN WORLD its different, its pretty hard to mess up a questline in older souls games. making a boss that one hits isnt making a boss hard, its lazy along with the other bosses in the damn game(and please fix the weird gravity.)pros : this game is fucking stunning, I mean one of the most beautiful games i've ever played theres been so many times I just stand there and stare at the damn skythe characters are all so amazing, im in love with every single npc, they are really all so unique and different the open world is a very nice touch, if youre able to get into it enough it really feels like you live inside a dark souls world. in a painting.the music is great!pvp feels great!endless things to doits perfect aside from everything I listed above.overall, the game is a heavy 8/10. if performance gets fixed then its a 10/10 with the frame drops randomly it really gives me a headache.and im open for debate in the comments!",0
Negative,"Game itself is a masterpiece but PC port is pathetic.Too much slowdown and stuttering even when FPS is 60 + .Wait for the game to be patched and running properly .For me its unplayable on Boss fights.Edit:Still not fixed.what is Namco Bandai / Fromsoft doing?Edit: 07.04.22 - DO not buy , Fromsoft and namco bandai are busy counting money instead of fixing the PC port.Even after slew of patches addressing balance , no ETA on fixing performance on PC .EDIT: 19.05.22 :clearly neither Fromsoft nor Namco Bandai care about PC , DO NOT BUY !beware the game has severe performance issues on PC no matter your specs. Digital Foundary also thinks so.Edit:Its October ie 06.10.22 :Still no FIX for pathetic port of PC .Why ?Edit:20.08.23 : Regional Pricing absurd increase by more than 50 % .Please dont buy these games.just dont !",0
Negative,This PC version is barbones. It lacks basic features like ultrawide support or a simple Vsync toggle.,0
Negative,"I'm sure that ELDEN RING would be a competent game if not for the issues currently causing any attempts at enjoyment to become a slog of annoyances, not to mention the overarching change in enemy level design leading to some. missteps that shall be touched on.First off this game runs unfortunately on my hardware though I do meet the requirements, as much as hopping aboard the bandwagon and shaking my fist at people I've paid full price to already would be therapeutic if the 60fps lock affected me in any way when my frames high-point has so far been mid 30's.Secondly the most pressing issue: where the flying monkey fuc@nuggets is my enemy? No, seriously where are they and more importantly what are they doing because 50-70% of non-boss encounters have some god-forsaken level of pop-in regardless of settings that have led me to become something of an expert of fighting enemy's that I Cannot fucking see save for spell-caster effects and.torches.Thirdly the design of this games open world seems all over the bloody place.E.G. early on I discovered a cave and traversed its wolf-laden depths to plunge my spear into the moist skaven-looking boss within and trounced him easily within two attempts, with the bonfire grace being within nearly 20 feet of the boss. A few hours later I happen upon a series of shrines guarded by shining headless giants and sacrifice an item to open one, what followed was 3 hours of getting trounced by an enemy that I would later learn is a basic enemy that dropped nothing which is infuriating when I had just spent an egregious amount of time experimenting to do minimal damage on his only punishable string (a 4-8 long string of attacks all of which one shot my character with 500 health, to cap this all off I believed that the enemy had no ability to be staggered so died as I was gobsmacked so hard after getting a critical hit when he did this obnoxiously long string 4 times in a row to a charged heavy, and 12 times after trying & failing to replicate it. Additionally the capstone of this encounter was the commute- Die, watch the loading screen, go to the portal, say yes to a menu prompt, watch the loading screen, turn around, drop down 4 ledges run to the guy it was malevolent beyond words. When he was finally beaten not only did he not drop anything but left me stranded on a floating platform with no way out, with the location actively messing with your map to the point that after 15 minutes of experimentation (incidentally i had to look up which key is map and how to 2-hand weapons because they are not listed in the key-bind directory consume a penis for that one FROM.) I learned that you can filter by specific landmarks and teleported to a random grace, triumphant and .with 600ish more souls runes than I'd started with.Yay.some bugs i'd though to include: jumping and staying airborne after a jump until the game just kills you and a cave boss.dying randomly to. I'm not sure I was jumping on my horse and he just went from half health to dead with the stagger break sound playing in the background.One last thing: this game has a fetish for placing the player in tiny box arenas for the benefit of the non-required boss AI as some are so large they spend more time clipping into it then out of it or can traverse the whole arena in half a second or both, and to ruin your cameras ability to give helpful information on when to dodge. Frig off Ricky.This game can be alright, but I've about had enough of riding into a blender of enemy's that failed to render, wait for a patch.Edit: So I've played another 30-ish hours, Still cannot see half or more of the opposition on a regular basis (And not just because the lock on is still a mess of terrible camera angles) Which I should reiterate is fuggin' unacceptable and is a contributing reason as to why I have yet to finish the game or play for more than a few hours at a time, the developers have done a lot to allow hybrids to not feel like garbage and have some new fancy spells, but I'm going to have to hang this title up until the devs fix this game breaking bug where almost all the mobs (and their bloody horses) have greater invisibility.",0
Negative,"This review pains me to write, as I really loved the game and wished to enjoy my time with it. Unfortunately, there are many short comings to this game at its current state that I just can not give a good review for. My opinions without spoilers will be at the TL;DR section at the bottom.-Let's first get this out of the way. The map design and visuals are GORGEOUS. My first steps into Leyndll Capital and the stunning Nokron and Nokstella cities gave me a feeling I've never felt in any of the hundreds of the games I've played. This is no doubt THE MOST immersive and enjoyable world FromSoftware has ever made.The amount of content in this game is also unfathomable. The amount of details and secrets such as the hidden Sellia tunnel or the countless Talismans and quests has made me eager to explore every nook and cranny of this world.The sound design is also stellar. Not only are the boss soundtracks absolutely enjoyable (my favorite without a doubt is the Tibia Mariner's theme), but the sound design in general is mesmerizing. The Latin chants of the Man-bats or the cries of the Cowmans, to name a few, are hypnotic to say the least.There are many shortcomings to this state that made MY experience unenjoyable.Let's first talk optimization, as I feel this applies to the most amount of users. The optimization at the game's current state is simply horrendous. Per my experience, the game could rarely run smoothly at 60fps with the lowest settings on my GTX 1070Ti with 16Gb ram and i7-8700. I'm also encountering frame-drops or frame-skipping in every boss fight. Granted, these are not the best specs, but they are at least better or at on-par with average graphic cards these days. A friend of mine who has a 3080 and i9 core could rarely achieve great frame rates at high settings; and others who had poorer specs could barely run the game at all.Ofcourse, turning the resolution down and altering graphics files could net an increase in frame rates, but players shouldn't be forced to juggle, nay, choose between immersiveness and playability.Next, is the boss designs. Don't get me wrong, lots of the boss designs are incredibly amazing and interesting, especially true of the demigods. However, this only lasts for the early-mid portion of the game. Many of the minibosses are over-recycled, and most bosses just become a war of attrition, or worse, luck. I understand that this is a huge open-world game and there are limited resources for development, but when you are fighting your 7th Ulcerated Tree Spirit or 6th Erdtree Avatar, the encounters themselves simply feel unrewarding and boring. I am also particularly disappointed with the reuse of the Naturalborn of the Void. The main appeal of this Lovecraftian scorpion is that it's supposed to be a one-time encounter with a being that should not exist in the game world. It should be horrifying and provide only a hint of what could exist in order to create a lingering dread and fear in the players. However, when it is reused again in a simple ice-cave, it just destroys the whole experience, at least for me.The bosses are also extremely unbalanced. I know, I know, ""git gud"" ""just dodge bro"". But it feels like this title heavily caters towards sorcerers and abusing summons. For the early game, the game doesn't expect you to have good spells, good stats, or good summons, and so the bosses feel fair, and close-range attacks feels powerful. This is flipped completely in the later portion. For my playthrough, I was using a hybrid int build. I could simply summon a +10 Oleg Knight, have it tank all the damage, and spam full-moons until whatever is infront of me is obliterated. This made the game uninteresting, and so I switched to a Strength/Faith build, and I can say that it was completely hell on earth. It feels as through all of the boss attacks are targeted towards melee-players. The magma wyrm attacks, astel voidborn AoEs, and many other attacks is nonthreatening to ranged users, and lethal to melee users. Because of the summons, the rests between each attack from bosses are cut extremely short compared to other souls games, as they expect you to be playing essentially 2 on 1, or 2 on 2. This has created a dilemma in which playing without summons and melee builds is extremely challenging, while playing with summons as a sorcerer is extremely unfun and repetitive.Also, most bosses are not challenging by design, but are simply scaled up to one shot you if you don't dodge random bs ability #476. Like ffs why does the Black Knife Ring Leader have like 500million health while being able to track and one shot you with his jump AoEs?I'd like to bring up Sekiro in comparison. Sekiro did the gameplay system perfectly, at least imo, where the boss attacks don't feel random but is a challenge of skills. If you fail to parry, that's on you. If you fail to recognize the chain combos, that's on you. If you parry everything, you get an opportunity to retaliate or heal. In Eldenring, it's not the same. Let's say you get hit by ability A. You are now faced with two decisions: heal, or not heal. Due to the short times between attacks, it is essentially a gambit, a random roll of a dice of whether you get punished for healing or not. This is, as I mentioned, because summons exist, and so the game is balanced to the summons.The fights themselves turn into a battle of attrition of whoever runs out of health or flasks first and whoever is the luckiest, instead of a true dance and true combat of skill.QuestsLastly, the quest system is also abominable. It is unwelcoming to veteran souls players and completely confusing to new players, considering this very well could be the first souls game or even the first ever game that someone plays. Though i did enjoy doing some quests and feeling like satisfied after linking the dots between questlines, how on earth are you supposed to progress main quest lines, such as Seluvi's plot, without looking up a guide to find a hidden tunnel in the billions of ruins? Or how do you know without exploring for hundreds of hours where Brother Corhyn went after he just simply left the roundtable without even a hint of where he's heading?Ofcourse, the game's not supposed to let you know everything, but at least give a slight hint or direction. You explore and finish the entire game without completing a single questline, even when you are ecstatic to do so.-The game is immersive and interesting, with jaw-dropping visuals and some unique mechanics. However, due to the atrocious optimization, poor balancing, and perplexing quest system, I simply cannot recommend it at its current state.I emphasize 'at its current state' because I wish that most of the complaints will be addressed, and I would love to absolutely adore this game. However, it is sadly not the case right now.That said, i'm going to be playing more Eldenring because, despite my complaints, it is pretty fun",0
Negative,"i love Bloodborne. i quite like DS3. i bought this game day one, and somehow, i've just fallen out of love. i'm happy that Elden Ring did really well. i had so much fun at the beginning, but i stopped enjoying myself 50+ hours in, and somehow i keep coming back to put in more hours. There's some really great stuff, some good classic fromSoft level design, but the whole open world part just doesn't work out for me.idk, if you love something, you love it, and if you don't, you can only try for so long.",0
Negative,"This is the first souls like game I have ever played, and I do seem to enjoy the format and it feels like a pretty fine game. However that the game is locked at 60 fps and it doesn't support a 3440x1440 screen is down right lazy of the developpers, why even bother releasing the game on PC if its gonna be locked up like a console game, every corner that could have been cut has been cut and the PC community can't even get mods to fix it since the anti cheat will come and ban you from what I can read, so if you want to fix these issues you need to play offline to not get banned.",0

Negative,"I'm sure the game is good if you did not buy it to be coop. The coop is very bad, but I think it is how the souls games do it, but I didn't know that. So if you are buying to play coop with a friend, don't. Buy it for solo play or not at all.",0
Negative,"~80 hours into a single character, mostly into a Faith build.I don't think I would tell someone on the fence to buy this game, but I would recommend it if they could get it on sale for 40% off or more. It's a game for diehard fans of the series (of which I would count myself) but it fails to perform past the initial few areas. The game itself is rocky on PC at its best moments. The port feels like it was an afterthought, and I do wish I had picked this up on my PS5, which is not something that I would commonly say. Large drops in framerate when some enemies cast spells, hitches when cutscenes transition from scene to scene. Luckily I have not encountered any serious difficulties in general gameplay, but I do dip below 60FPS commonly. It's obviously manageable, but I'm somewhat disappointed overall with this aspect.The gameplay is the same core loop as we have been playing for the past decade in the souls series. This isn't a negative, but it has me beg the question of what people are seeing when they call Elden Ring the 2022 GOTY or an ""industry-level game changer"". There's barely anything new here. You can jump, you can be stealthy to a degree, you have a somewhat temperamentally-controlled horse. The attacks feel the same, the peaks and troughs of weapon powerlevels feel very similar (Man that first Uchigatana I found really trivialized most of Limgrave, much like the Uchi in every Souls game ever) and the core loop feels very similar. Incantations and sorceries are very, very cool and generally quite rewarding to use in this game, hence why I went with a Faith build. Smiting nerds with lightning bolts and giant red lightning stakes or massive exploding fireballs is extremely satisfying, and probably why I made it this far. But nothing else is really that innovative, sans the Sekiro stance-breaking mechanic.The complete reliance on the ""hold sword in air for 12 seconds while the Tarnished attempts to read your move"" style of attacking really cuts this game down for me. Bosses and larger enemies hold onto their swings for dear life, just to bait you into a roll and catch you halfway through recovering. It feels lazy, like they discovered this was a viable option wherever it first made its appearance in the series and they decided THAT was the thing that was needed to truly make the game ""difficult"". The oppressive aggression some enemies have is exhilarating and keeps you on your toes, whereas this kind of mechanic just serves to frustrate a player when they get caught and have to then watch a 13 hit combo delete their character.The level design in this game takes a sharp decline in the later portions of the game. Limgrave, Liurnia(mostly), Altus, Leyndell? These are all fantastic zones. Mountaintops of the Giants? Could be better. Caelid? Whatever that is, it ain't it, chief. Lake of Rot? Hilarious, loved it. What a great throwback to places like the Valley of Defilement and Blighttown, even though this kind of thing exists in every single Souls game and we should be expecting it. I even enjoyed Mt. Gelmir, as it housed a very fun questline and the obligatory Stormbringer fight. But then we see zones like the Subterranean Shunning Grounds (ok it was fun to kill the horrible NPC here), Farum Azula (got dayum dragons gibbing my 30-vigor ass because I'm too stupid to learn how to dodge when I'm not looking at them), the Consecrated Snowfield (hur dur blizzard haha remember frigid outskirts? btw co director of dark souls 2!) and the Haligtree (why is everything suddenly so resistant to my goddamn lightning), and it truly sucks the fun out of the game. These areas can be beautiful, have wonderful soundtracks and interesting artistic qualities, but they are such slogs to get through it no longer feels fun to progress. The nosedive in quality of level design is unfortunate in such a highly anticipated game.The crafting and Ash of War systems are fantastic. If nothing else, I hope other RPG-style games take note of the ability to swap infusions and skills on the fly like this. Crafting throwable pots or knives or arrows with materials you collect is a great way to reward exploration and being the type of person to mash Triangle to pick everything up off the ground.The open-world formula really works for this series, though Elden Ring itself suffers from some ""pacing"" issues, if you can call it that. Exploration feels rewarding, but once you progress further into the game it becomes less so and the world slowly becomes more sparse. This made it less appealing for me to explore some of the aforementioned slogs and not just try to blitz the enemies and find ways to avoid ones that I didn't particularly want to waste 15 lightning bolts on.All in all, I think this game is worth trying if you're a fan of the series, and there are definitely some great and rewarding moments. But the fact of the matter is that it's the same game we've been playing for a decade, with not much new to offer aside from an open world that deviates slightly from the barren ""ubisoft-style"" formula. If you're looking for something new and exciting, you might find what you're looking for here, but I have my doubts.TL;DR: git gudder than me and enjoy the game, but I think it's a 6.5 to 7/10 at best, and I would probably rate this just above DS2 in terms of how much I enjoy playing it.and, you know this is just my opinion, right?",0
Negative,"Where to begin.I'm a fan of From Software games and soulslike since the first Demon Souls. Elden Ring is a masterpiece in many aspects: beautifully executed in terms of lore, soundtracks, environments, particle effects, cinematics and dialogues. I finished the DLC (I didn't complete everything because no Steam trophies duh) and I couldn't be more disappointed than this. The DLC costs 40 dollars, which is worth the money only for the sheer amount of things that have been implemented and added to the base game. In many aspects, with some more tuning a bit of stuff, you could have released this as a spin-off or sequel of Elden Ring for 60 dollars and nobody would have complained about it. The DLC is even more beautiful than the base game, I sincerely believe that From Software hit its peak in terms of art department. The graphics are simply stunning, the areas rich and vibrant and you could almost forget the obscene amount of unfairness and incompetence that they keep putting into the gameplay.Almost. My personal advice for such a great company: do not produce videogames, switch to graphic novels/movies/books or something that does not include complex gameplay mechanics. You cannot make a decent game gameplay-wise even if your life depends on it, exception made for your only technically well executed game, which is Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice. These are the issues of this game:1. Bosses are completely unfair, hitboxes are completely unfair, camera is completely unfair, everything is complete and utter bs in the DLC, 10 times more than the base game. A single swing of a sword passes over you by a mile and you still get hit, you touch the back of the head of a hyppopotamus and get teleported into his mouth, you press R1 in front of the staggered boss and you do not trigger the critical hit, or you hit R1 way further than you should and you get teleported into the critical hit, the particle effects of a boss move prevent you from seeing what's the boss next move, the 5th combo piece of boss triggers randomly, so you cannot plan to trade after the 4th attack;2. Everything has been designed to screw you over without any consideration about the gameplay itself: spending 10 minutes hitting the legs of a giant furnace that oneshots you just to drop a useless item, parkouring yourself on the roofs of the final legacy dungeon just to find a useless item. Why would anyone even care about exploring a map that's 95% empty, 4% filled with garbage and 1% filled with interesting stuff? I explored and got 90% of the useful stuff during the first playthrough just because I'm obsessive about leaving something behind and boy I will never do it again. Do you want to make a compelling open world game? Learn something from Zelda: BoTW, where any single corner of the map has something quick, easy and rewarding to do, instead of filling an entire area of enemies that two-shots you so you can loot an excrement (literally);3. Map expansion was incredibly linear and boring in the base game, very good job implementing a map that dives deep in the ""vertical"" dimension, just to completely screw any player over because you just couldn't make a map representation that could be remotely intuitive to navigate. Why not adding some vertical layers you could navigate in the map menu? It has already been done with Underground Map (Siofra river for example) and Normal map;4. The damage the enemies deal in the DLC is utter bs and the balance system around the scadutree fragment is the laziest solution you could ever think of: you basically have a chunk of another game stitched to the main one, with zero connection and zero continuity, except for the lore. You talk with Miquella arm and you are projected into Elden Ring 2. Separate map, separate mobs, separate balance system, separate everything: God forbid you could make everything work organically without needing to add external parameters to make things artificially harder;5. Game difficulty. Now, this is a very controversial point. I do not care if a game is complex and difficult, I care how the difficulty has been realised. Chess is an incredibly complex game but the complexity comes from the well thought design: every piece moves in a certain way and the combination of the moves is what increases the difficulty. Elden Ring is artificially inflated with unnecessary, dull defects or shenanigans just to reach a level of difficulty that satifies whoever sadist is in charge of executing the gameplay design. I wonder how the game would be without broken camera, broken hitboxes, more than 0 quality of life features (hey they added the (!) to new items, it took 10 years but they actually did something good QoL wise) and boss patterns that are not completely governed by RNG. There is a difference between a challenge and playing a rigged game, and the latter is exactly how it feels to play Elden Ring SotE, unless you rig it yourself by using Spirit Ashes and many other tools that devoid you from any challenge and allow you to appreciate Elden Ring in the only way you could: without actually playing it.",0
Negative,"Well, I thought, when I played this game solo, it was one of the best games I have ever played, then I took a look at the multiplayer and just changed my mind.Pros:+ Really large world that feels filled and makes exploring it a pleasure.+ Difficult but rewarding combat where you have tons of build options and different ways you can play the game. It also adds to the replayability of the game.+ Game is well paced and world map opens step by step, always keeping you eager to see what might be around the next corner.+ Some bosses in this game can become such spectacles that you can outright feel the adrenaline rush like you are in the game.+ Impressive music that compliments the atmosphere.+ Good graphics and decent environment design.+ Starscourge RadahnCons:- I do not really like that some bosses are recycled, some boss encounters that show up in later parts of the game are just bosses from early game with some stat tweaks or they put two of them together against you.- I do not really like that some dungeons are recycled. Catacombs while layout wise being unique, use exact same textures and identical final boss arenas. - Some of the late game bosses scale a bit questionably. Even heavy armor tanky builds get one-shot and some builds like strength (yes despite the buffs) remain weak for the entirety of the last quarter of the game. It mostly feels like you are railroaded towards overpowered builds like bleed or frost. Not a major issues though, all bosses (except Malenia perhaps) are completely possible even with weaker builds.- I ABSOLUTELY ABHOR MULTIPLAYER. Here's why:-P2P servers- P2P in 2022, really? Seriously? I think it would be better if they did not put multiplayer in there at all. I spent days troubleshooting everything from firewall settings to port forwarding, I still automatically disconnect always. Upload and download speeds wise I have a good connection and never have I experienced connectivity issues with other online games but this game literally is unplayable.-P2P servers- While invasions are a cool mechanic and they are there to balance coop as you have 2 people or more to face those bosses but game already scales cooperators down and scales mobs and bosses up in cooperative play. I think they could have given the option to turn invasions off but, it is fine. What makes invasions actually bad is my point above, with lag bananza how am I supposed to protect my precious host of fingers?-P2P servers-P2P servers- You have to buy or craft a certain consumable to initiate coop, which is a bit silly. Item is not even difficult to craft, so why? It does not make the coop harder to initiate just annoying, please get rid of it. Please make it a non-consumable item.-P2P serversOVERALL: 6.5/10 (9/10 FOR SOLO PLAYERS)",0

Negative,"Fanboys will worship anything. The combat in Elden Ring is as stale and boring as it has become with the rest of From's games (QuickTime events with enemy emotes instead of on-screen button prompts), and nothing new or innovative is done with that system - they refuse to iterate anything new here, and hardcore fans continue to eat it up because it's what they're used to. Until From actually gives the enemies some AI and creativity, Combat continues to be choreographed dance battles (using swords and spells) against partially scripted training-dummies. Makes you feel really good when your dance timing is right, and the game rewards you with a quick in-engine video of you doing MaSsIVe DaMAge!1 to another over-designed chump.The open world is somehow something new and innovative, but it's just Breath of the Wild wearing Gears of War nail polish. Much like the aforementioned chumps, the visual polish is high, but the depth stops there. Story and deep story elements are the same scant cladding From has always used. But, there are lots of shiny items everywhere to pick up, so that's nice. Now I get why they hired George R R Martin for world-building, because who else do you go to when you need bland, inoffensive fantasy set-dressing that's easily palatable to mass markets? We were promised a new, innovative IP here that would be accessible to Souls fans, and RPG fans alike. But it's really not that. Even the accessibility part is questionable, because if you've never played a From game you're going to be lost - Elden Ring does next to nothing to introduce you to its gameplay or combat systems, leaving you to either sus it out yourself, or forcing you to turn to guides and youtube videos for things that a single proficient combat tutorial could easily teach you. Not adequately explaining your gameplay mechanics is a great way to artificially inflate difficulty, and make diehards feel more competent, but it's not fun or interesting. If you don't enjoy Souls, or you've gotten bored of it like I have, then this isn't the title for you.I hear rumors there's a full combat overhaul already in the pipes, maybe it'll be worth a try after that gets implemented.",0

Negative,MOUSE AND KEYBOARD USERS PLEASE READ: i've played every dark souls game and am a huge fan of the series. i have 5 hours played but i can say that most of that time played is me afk on my second monitor watching tutorials on how to optimise settings for pc. it blows my mind that in 2022 you release a game (i know its meant for console) but you have video game developers who actually released a game in 2022 that is available for purchase by the pc community where you cant map each button to a specific keybind. you cant even pull out your pouch with out pressing escape. the default keybind for the mount is E+UP ARROW KEY? in what universe ? not only that i play on a widescreen monitor and there is no widescreen support. you can go in to the game files and mess around with some setting names but i just cant be bothered. optimisation for pc is absolute garbage. this game was not meant to be played with mouse and keyboard or on pc. i have a pretty beefy set up and i still was getting constant frame drops. would not recommend buying on steam,0

Negative,"Elden Ring is an open world soulslike with solid mechanics, great level design, and fantastic customization. Unfortunately, the game has balancing issues that turn the early game into a slog and combat, while built on solid mechanics, that is often needlessly difficult and unfair at times. While I personally enjoyed the game, I don t think I d recommend it.The BasicsIt s dark souls with a fresh coat of paint and a jump button. This means third person combat (usually melee) in which the player learns and masters the patterns of enemies to best defend and retaliate against them. Swinging one s weapon, blocking, and dodging all require stamina, leaving the player vulnerable if they overextend. Lastly, the player is only ever a few hits from death (rarely more than ten), but can heal with potions if they find an opening in which to use them. These games carry a reputation for being challenging, having sufficient depth to require a certain mastery from the player.Elden Ring changes the formula slightly with the addition of jumping as both an offensive and defensive tool. Additionally, repeated hits on an enemy in a short time frame will knock it down for a critical attack. Returning souls players will also find that weapons require far less stamina to swing, increasing player agency substantially.ExplorationStormveil castle, the Raya Lucaria Academy, and so many more. While the side dungeons may vary in quality, the main ones are exceptional. There are several routes through which to reach the end, often with breathtaking landmarks to keep you oriented and hint at where you ll go next. The areas are massive, but naturally segmented with checkpoints and shortcuts. Finally, they re packed with items, secrets, and enemies, picking up the pace from the slower world outside. The world at large, naturally, isn t as dense as the main dungeons. That said, it still has the handcrafted feel with many points of interest and encounters strewn across it.CustomizationPlayers level up using runes, slowly growing attributes of their choosing. Vigor, mind, and endurance boost health, focus, and stamina. Everything else determines what types of equipment you can use. Strength for big swords, faith for incantations. Importantly, the game has the runtime to allow for players to allocate enough points to explore multiple options in their character build. As far as options are concerned, there are several categories of weapons with a large portion of them having special attacks and traits to distinguish them. There are a variety of spells with widely ranging requirements, many of which are low enough to support otherwise purely physical builds. Last but not least are ashes of war, which can be applied to weapons to alter their movesets and infuse them with different properties. All in all, the customization is fantastic with a great many choices of viable options.MultiplayerAs of now, the game suffers from serious connectivity issues, with players disconnecting from each other at random, provided they can connect at all. When it finally does work, you ll normally get invaded by someone with an optimized bleed or madness build (no fun allowed) who can full to zero you off of one or two hits. That said, PVP is the best it s ever been in a souls game. Ignoring them, the fantastic diversity in weapons and skills means that cooperators will be able to compliment each other s builds, almost always beating out NPC summons. As a note, it s a waste of time outside of dungeons since you ll have to explore on foot. Co-op, though it doesn t often work, makes dungeons more fun and can make even the worst fights manageable.What writing?The premise was never properly defined or motivated, with the introductory slideshow sharing little of value. The characters were promising before they disappeared for good. I read my item descriptions and explored as best I could, but after it all the world feels empty, devoid of stories. My character has no place in the world; no past nor connections. What s this ""Elden Ring"" and why does everyone want it? Who s this person who levels me up? Frankly, I couldn t tell you, nor will the game try to.NumbersTo upgrade a regular weapon to the maximum, the player will require 96 smithing stones of varying tiers. I used over 900 smithing stones on weapons, costing me something in the ballpark of 1.2 million runes on upgrades overall. To put that in perspective, that s enough to level a player from level 1 to 83, or 83 to 105 (late game). Ignoring the fact that smithing stones are rare to the point that you might not find enough to fully upgrade one weapon (let alone ten), the shortage of runes in the early game is especially bad with full dungeons failing to provide the runes for a single level.Why s this matter? Firstly, enemies across the board have high stats and are scaled up considerably with each new area. My character, durable first, fun second, and threatening last, was physically incapable of killing many late game bosses. That said, anything less than that high durability was susceptible to one hit kills in higher leveled areas. As such, it s often numbers that force players away from the main dungeons and with the relative scarcity of both runes and smithing stones, it can be days before a player is strong enough to return. That is to say that progress is frequently held back by a lack of what is effectively grinding, rather than mechanical mastery.ctrl+c ctrl+vBesting a giant the first time is exhilarating. The fiftieth one won t meaningfully differ from the one before it. Yes, there are a lot of enemy types, but not enough to make side areas distinctive. Side dungeons feel the same due to similar architecture and enemy types not to mention the repeat boss fights all while lacking any discernible narrative significance. Most rewards are stone sword keys and crafting materials, which aren t any good on their own. Lacking narrative intrigue and meaningful powerups to help the player overcome adversity in the main areas the world at large, beautiful as it is, feels empty.Boss Fights are good unless The boss has overwhelming numbers, requiring hundreds of hits to kill.The boss has a practically undodgeable attack which governs the player s success.There are multiple bosses, whose attacks can and will overlap.The boss is constantly running away and can t be hit in most cases.The boss has inconsistent follow ups or is always attacking, rendering player attacks unsafe.That the player s only ever one or two mistakes from death isn t necessarily bad, but there s a difference between the boss forcing a mistake with an undodgeable attack and the player actually making a mistake. If it was just once or twice, it wouldn t be so bad, but it would seem that more often than not, bosses check at least one item off the list, if not two. Many of the boss fights can t be realistically beaten by the player alone, requiring a second player or npc to share the worst of it. All that said, there are stellar bosses mixed in there, only spaced tens of hours apart, blocked mainly by poor boss fights. The game was difficult, all too often at the expense of being enjoyable.It s not terrible, but a lot of the game just wasn t much fun. Getting stuck on a boss for hours because I needed to go near perfect for minutes at a time, only to return to a world that has long since lost its magic. Losing connection to my friends over and over, hoping it d be better than the day prior, was frustrating. All the while, I loved exploring the main dungeons and lambasting my friends for getting caught by the undodgeable attacks. The core gameplay was good, and the other sixty hours wasn t. I had my fun, but I can t say I d recommend it.",0
Negative,"It's hard to find a spot to start reviewing this game because all of it is just so painfully mediocre Starting from the beginning of the game, it feels like they had George Martin come in just to completely disregard all of his work. You're supposed to be playing after the epic events of ""The Shattering"" where all the demigods are at war and the abandonment of the Greater Will, which is cool, but did none of this happen in the lands between? Everything is completely unaffected save for a quarter the map they re-colored the grass to red. While the game looks alright, the art direction in this game is absolutely abysmal. From your first steps outside it just looks like a beautiful summer day, there's absolutely zero telling anything is wrong. Even in the overworld your exploration feels incredibly unrewarding and generally like a huge waste of time. 90% of what you want to explore either results in finding a cookbook to make throwing items, or takes you to an extremely repetitive dungeon. Most of the dungeon's just have a generic copy and pasted bosses, with similar copy and pasted environments leading up to them. Typically I feel in fantasy games you have the main goal of leading the kingdom in effort to better it, but why bother if nothing is even wrong? Your character has absolutely zero reason to pursue the Elden Ring, there's no undead curse, no one to protect, there isn't any given factors to drive you as a player in game or out of game. Mind boggling to me people actually think this deserves awards. Overall the game is just ok. Nothing new, nothing different, nothing worth experiencing 6/10. Can't with a clear conscious recommend this game to anyone for full price. $30 game at best with a $15 DLC. Do better Fromsoft.",0

Negative,"So far, hard to argue, the best soulslike title produced to date. It's beautiful, the world is content rich, there's little or nothing in the way of wasted space. Many game systems are rewarding. It is really fun to climb around and explore the world.The game has some problems.Many, many, many encounters are a complete shit show. Stormknights with rapid unmitigatable hyper-stagger AOEs. Mob-linking opponents placed where they simply cannot be prevented. Rapid archers perched out of bounds. Enemy damage, flatly, across the entire game, is wildly out of proportion.Invaders in general are a hot bag of trash - same hacks, same backstab exploits, same one-hit stunlock bullshit as ever. It's joyless. NPC invaders are nearly as bad, with exotic weapon arts and spells that leave you no counterplay, no engagement, just flick first or die.Soul/rune/xp rewards are a shit show - you will be leveling purely off of boss kills, co-op souls and crunchy runes - liquid rune rewards are so low in contrast to the lethality of encounters, you simply will not accumulate a large enough wallet to level while fighting on-par opponents.Melee weapon arts that stop registering hits after damaging a single entity. A total inability to enhance armor, forcing the player to just. beg RNGesus for armor drops that [i[might[/i] prove better.The complete absence of any shield with magic resist over 75%Spells like Glintstone Arc spamming fast enough, large enough, and staggering hard enough THROUGH A 65% MAGIC RESIST SHIELD, to completely fill a hallway with. no effective counter. There are some extremely poor decisions here.Edit: 32 hours later and I keep putting this down after experiences like Stranded Graveyard. I'm legitimately exhausted with how much I'm told by the community to cheese weapon arts, bleed, sorcery, or rely on spirits and summons, anything to ""solve"" combat as fast as possible. Isn't this franchise celebrated for its melee combat?I can see why nobody wants to engage with it. Stormveil knights completely invalidating guard with an instant cast. Grafted mobs swinging two, three, five, eight times in a twice-delayed combo that swings them around the combat zone before restarting the exact same unapproachable attack pattern, spinning around like a DS2 boss to keep you perfectly aligned in the hurtbox. Giant dogs from caelid collapsing defense with rushdowns. This isn't fun. There are fun pieces in this game, but collectively, as a whole product, it is just disappointing.",0
Negative,"Gameworld is beautiful, play style is perfect unless you play on a PC without controller.its atrocious. Very little has been done to port this properly to PC. All help on screen, in the menu, simply everywhere, are help and indicator bindings for controller. If you play with keyboard and mouse you are going to be lost, utterly lost. There is no way to change controller indicators to corresponding PC settings. It takes forever to figure out which controller setting does what on PC keyboard. On top of this, the default bindings often make no sense at all. Example, to switch usable items, which you need at a moments notice and within split seconds, you have to use the arrow keys to change a usable item. You ether have to leave the mouse and use the arrow keys or move away with your left had from the movement keys.both lead to instant death in a dark souls game during a fight. Whoever came up with this has no idea about standard PC setups. The settings menu for keyboard and mouse is not much help, as many of the bindings are simply missing. Had to search the web to figure out how to open the map, as no help was given for PC players and the keybinding is missing from the settings. If you come from the former dark souls games you got at least some notion what to do, however after so many years porting games now, you would expect FromSoft to at least give the PC some recognition and just the bare minimum, but not even that has been done. This game could easily reach a 90+ rating on steam, but as it stands, with the utter disregard of PC controls and frustration it comes with, it gets a thumbs down from me.Its a real shame, this could have been a masterpiece.",0
Negative,"I'm honestly just not impressed with the game. I had more fun playing dark souls 1, DS3, and Sekiro. The open world concept is nice but it doesn't feel very satisfying to play. Multiplayer and performance issues as well leave room to be desired. I will continue to play the game but if you're on the fence about it then you're not missing much.",0
Negative,"It has been anticipated for quite a long time. To say expectations were high would be quite understated. Being part of its sizable feverish following, you naturally wish for it to fulfill the idea of a game that you have made up in your imagination, which in hindsight often seems foolish.Elden Ring is FromSoftware's shot at an open world. I avoid most open world games, because I do not care about mindless collection and completion rodent wheels that most of them are built to be. I was hoping for FromSoftware to have the wisdom to steer away from the typical trappings of what they were going to attempt, and to actually deliver on what open worlds have promised to be, ever since they have become the industry's favorite gimmick. No need to make it explicit, I don't believe they did.I will not go much into the performance issues that have blighted this game so far. They exist and make the game worse, though my gripes lie more fundamental in nature, and unlike the poor technical constitution, they have no hope of being mended. I am also going to assume that you are familiar with Dark Souls III, since this game lifts quite much from it, it is more timely to simply point out where it differs.The world of Elden Ring is segmented into several distinct zones, each with a ""main dungeon"" that is relevant for making actual story progress and a variety of ""side content"", which is in significant part rather generic and repetitive. There are a vast number of random soldier camps and ""mini dungeons"" that primarily exist to hold certain items of loot, but do not stand out as worth seeking out for their own sake, once you have seen an abundance of them.The enemy rosters of the various overworld zones have a disappointing amount of overlap, with soldiers and knights of various factions just being reskins of the same base model, and many lesser foes being ubiquitous across a large portion of the world. Quite a few of the minor bosses also get reused to a silly degree*. At some point you may consider that stopping to fight them just doesn't seem particularly worth your investment and would rather make use of that new horse to skip right past without any trouble.Overall different regions are primarily distinguished by the looks of their terrain, which do indeed look very pretty, but in the end they largely share a lot of the same stuff and blend together as you keep playing. The moment the game shines however is when you leave the uniformity of the content pastures and enter the main dungeons. These are actually well crafted and intricate large structures that merit your attention and time. They resemble something closer to a FromSoftware level, with winding paths, shortcuts and atmospheric architecture. The addition of jumping has opened up new ways of traversing them, and generally the pathways are more complex than ever before, evoking the feeling of exploring a truly massive place.If you are familiar with Dark Souls III and its moment-to-moment combat, Elden Ring will feel strangely familiar. The basic combat loop is the same in essence, with many weapons, attacks and spells being completely identical to their older counterparts.The most notable addition is horse combat, which allows to swing weapons while moving very fast. With a little bit of practice most overworld encounters can be fairly trivialized with hit-and-run tactics, because enemies rarely get a good chance at retaliation before you dash away.Ground combat has a new shield counter-move, aswell as the ability to ""slot"" looted weapon arts onto arbitrary weapons. What is odd is that elemental infusions can now be arbitrarily changed at any time now. No longer is it necessary to dedicate a weapon to a particular type of damage or stat scaling, it can be adjusted at any time while resting. It puts to question why such a system still exists if all it does is reshuffle around some damage numbers to whatever seems suitable at the time, rather than being a means to permanently invest into a weapon, like some kind of roleplaying game.I struggle to really come up with a succinct way of describing how I feel about bosses beyond just being generally unsatisfied with them. There being such a large amount of them really underlines how dependent FromSoftware has become on creating frantic, confusing, difficult to read movesets as a means to create ""challenge"". For many if not most bosses, I was frequently compelled into long periods of passivity, unsure about when I actually had a valid opening for attacks or actions other than dodging and blocking. It felt less like fighting a creature and more like playing a guessing game with frustrating stakes, which technically has always been the case for Dark Souls to some extent, but never had been this obvious before.Many moves are designed to force you into a timed roll by cheap means and punish simply maneuvering out of the way. Many melee attacks either have an AOE-blast on them to force you into abusing i-frames, regardless of whether the weapon actually touches you, or worse, simply drag the boss towards you so that an attack hits even if you have pre-emptively backed up. Not only does this make fights feel very one-dimensional, it also looks incredibly silly.Very few bosses manage to break away from being a moveset that you just have to memorize. The few that do are pretty much recycled concepts from past FromSoftware games**, including everyone's favorite machete wielding giant.Continuing the theme of eerie familiarity is the story and lore. Elden Ring continues the trend of having characters speak in very vague and cryptic metaphors and item descriptions being the main catalyst for worldbuilding.[This section may spoil the overall trajectory of the story]It becomes rather obvious after a while, that the story is almost beat for beat the same as Dark Souls III, with the names of characters and places simply being swapped out. The Tarnished are Undead in all but name, and the quest they embark on has them collect Great Runes instead of Cinders of Lords, to link the restore the Elden Ring, so that life may once again flourish in the world. Or maybe you want to go for the Age of Dark Ending equivalent, which I am going to predict the game will offer, without having actually finished it. Once again, it's not exactly the first time that FromSoftware has repeated itself, but this time feels particularly blatant, especially in context with all the other recycling that has been going on in the rest of the game.I derive no joy from not recommending this game. I wanted to like it as badly as anyone else. It's not like it is entirely awful, I have enjoyed it early on in the honeymoon phase, when everything was still new and I had no idea where the game was gonna go. But the creeping realization eventually set in, that it really was just stretching a small amount of fresh content over a vast space, and that it was not going to become any better.The Elden Ring experiment has failed. It has resulted in a shallower, bloated and bland game, but it looks like it's made a lot of money, so there is no reason to assume that this won't be what awaits us in future FromSoftware titles. This is the first one that I shelved before completing it, simply due to being burnt out and ceasing to care, not because of any one particular road block._* I have lost count of how many times I've encountered the same dragon boss fight being repurposed by merely applying a different color and elemental damage type. In once instance I even correctly predicted the reveal of an ice-flavored dragon, simply by the presence of a suspicious large open frozen lake.** There is one boss gimmick that is original to this game, however I don't want to spoil it (though I think it sucks)",0
Negative,"Review Recap:After a few patches, the game has received some balance changes, fixes and etc.As it stands right now, it still is a PVE beauty, but that's not to say it doesnt have problems at all. In terms of PVP it still is a mess, even though the ""Dueler's code"" has gained awareness in the community, with some of the playerbase leaving due to ""DiFfIcUlTy"". (The game has issues in this regard, yes. But nothing that the casual playerbase or the not so good players are complaining about).Lets start with my personal issue, Don't worry, its just this one. (It has been patched slightly but it still stands) - The blood Katana: This weapon is just too much. Its a bleed proc weapon that does an insanely fast combo with fairly good range, minor FP consumption (not that it matters since you will win or die before that becomes an issue) and far too much damage!I've just finished fighting Miquella, and one of the summons I got (Two, in fact. Due to multiple attempts) used this Katana and shredded the boss's health in a couple of attacks.So. This weapon is insanely good for bosses, paired with pose and less damage on the mixed physick.Now. This is for PVE. For bosses. So as you can imagine, in PVP, the issue is about as problematic as it seems. Long range, bleed, tons of damage and fast. Might as well just turn on an instant kill hack, and the effect shouldn't differ too much.Alright, so now what are some issues with the game itself. - The bosses are a bit uninspiring some times. I can't fully blame them for this though since there are so many, and quite a few are amazing, memorable and weird in a dark souls standard. However, this is not a dark souls game, so expecting to see a major dragon like Seath the Scaleless, just doesn't add up. - The movesets. Ok. So each boss seems to have taken a different take on their moveset than dark souls. This meaning that while in dark souls, the boss had moves that went well with each other and had certain rythms to be followed, Elden ring thought that this rythm in dark souls was already too familiar and decided to change. So attacks are slow with lingering hitboxes that don't make a ton of sense sometimes, or are just annoying, that and the combos are either insanely fast, or ridiculously slow.What do I mean with all of this? Well. Elden ring was tailor made to screw up with Souls gamers timings. Really screwing with what we had known from previous games to prevent it from being ""too easy for legacy players"". While I accept the difficulty change, and the rythm shifts, some moves still feel like they are robbing the player with how long the hitboxes last on some of their slow moves.- Some areas are also problematic since their design seems to be beginner level, with the difficulty being set by simply adding too many enemies in one location with what seems little thought to it (Mogh's area for example).- Some enemies also share this crappy design with them spamming and spazzing attacks at incredibly annoying speeds and more. They feel more of an annoyance than a challenge and that really hurts this game compared to previous souls games.Its a shame but I think Myasaki is losing his touch.I still very much enjoy the game and think it is absolutely fantastic in so many regards. Easily my GOTY choice just because of the sheer ammount of content, exploration, and everything else that this game does right.The exploration is mindblowing, the quest lines as mysterious and amazing as ever (No we do not need to know where they are. Searching is part of the fun), it just does everything else right.So despite everything bad mentioned above, the game still stands as a fantastic experience worth double the price it asks, at least for me. Keep in mind the things above are just the ones I considered bad, along with some community members. But regardless, the game is still a peak experience with gameplay, story, builds, creativity, everything else. And BY FAR, one of the best Worlds the Souls-Like Series from Fromsoft has ever had.Why the negative review then? Because most people search for the negatives to see if its worth buying the game or not, despite the bad things mentioned in these reviews.I hope this helps you all",0
Negative,"I will start this review by saying Elden Ring is objectively a fun game, a good but slightly overrated addition to the souls series. It reminds me of dark souls 2 and dark souls 3 combined. The main issues of the main game is that the bosses are largely recycled as ganks and forgettable, save for about 10-15 (which, overall in the game, is a very small percentage). The dungeons also get really repetitive, and some of them are just downright obnoxious. Really, i planned to give this about an 8/10.THAT BEING SAID, this game's PC port is garbage. It crashes constantly, the random framerate issues can last for forever, caves and the like have terrible lighting bugs that causes rainbow-esk color spectrums to flash randomly (which is totally a risk for people with epilepsy), and worst of all.I had a save with 55 hours in the game, that became corrupted for seemingly no reason. I managed to even get the save file running whenever i would reinstall it, only for it to become corrupted again after i first exit the game. I ran every single save file restorer i could find and watched at least 10 youtube videos on how to save corrupted elden ring files, nothing worked.In that file i had explored every nook and cranny of every area with an OCD-like motivation, i found items and areas i cannot even remember how to get to. I had items friends had given me, which are now gone forever, and to be honest? I dont feel nearly the motivation to play the game after having gone through this.I will still play this game to try to 100% it, as i do with every soulsborne game (except sekiro because im not a fan of that one personally), but if my new file gets corrupted I will outright quit the game. This will go as the first fromsoft game i havent beaten, if it occurs. Make no mistake, I'm sure this game is great on console, but this experience has overall ruined the game for me. These bugs are inexcusable for a game that has been patched multiple times, but i guess fromsoft is too busy trying to balance pvp (which they are doing unsuccessfully). Still love the company, but this left a bad taste in my mouth.",0
Negative,"This game is good no doubt about that but IS found the game to be more bs after you hit the mid game than anything. It is not fun, things become a drag to fight and there are a lot of re used bosses that are not fun to fight, I understand they could not make every boss unique,maybe, but it is not an enjoyable experience.I was much more invested at the beginning and enjoyed it all more, technical problems, locked to 60 fps, really? No ultrawide support too, I know that for the latter not many have ultrawide monitors but it should be included, the no over 60 fps without using mods is very backwards of them to do, The engine they are using is showing its age in that aspect, the pc port is not as good as it could be.",0
Negative,"Do not get me wrong, i am still playing this game after almost 50 hours and i am probably gonna play it for 50 more, but only if bandanamco fixes its shitty optimization for their games on pc. this game is no less that perfect. However the sudden stutters that always come to make me die in the most dire situations is infuriating. I have already died almost a hundred deaths solely because of this cursed stutter that i have tried every solution on the internet to fix it.if you have a console, better buy this game on your PS5 or PS$ even than on your pc because there is a 33% chance that you will be f***** just like me.",0
Negative,"""10/10, better than Breath of the Wild"" - BULLSHIT. The game runs like ASS on PC for what it looks. 60fps locked? Are you serious?! No matter what PC you have, you are stuck with stutter and performance drops. The game has terrible PC controls with mouse and keyboard, retarded keyboard layout decisions that you can't even remap! This game does not deserve a perfect score for all the technical issues it has. And NO, giving it 10/10 now, because MAYBE it will be patched is bullshit. You don't score something because MAYBE it will be fixed LATER. Other than that? Normal Souls experience. If you're not into Souls, you will not like this one either. It is not an open world as you know it. It's not Horizon, or Witcher or any other ""normal"" open world game. It's a Souls game with a horse. Interface, models, HUD, UI, even animations are straight from Dark Souls. The way you play and progress is the same as Dark Souls. It's not any more new user friendly. People who try to convince you to ""play it NOW"" without giving you the full picture and full disclosure should not have the right to speak up online.",0
Negative,No Ultrawide screen support. Locked at 60fps. There's a huge amount of screen tear (despite using a GSync monitor). I've also had three crash-to-desktops in the 30minutes I spent trying to get the game to work decently.Terrible port and unplayable in its current state. I highly recommend waiting for a few patches before purchasing the title.,0
Negative,The gameplay and story so far is amazing. The world building is arguably better than past Souls games. The game is a solid 9/10. Or it will be when optimisation is fixed for PC. I have has serious FPS drops running the lowest setting on hardware better than minimum specs.,0
Negative,"Massive stuttering, sometimes with the game hanging over a second. Wait to see if they patch it.",0
Negative,"DLC broke my game.Can't access to my save files, Game no longer display properly.Extremely disapointed.",0
Negative,"I was excited and fell into the hype of playing my first dark souls game. For a new player, with no introduction into a souls series of games there is no explanation whatsoever from the game about how to get started, what various stats do, etc. its annoying and frustrating because you have no idea how you should level up your character or what items are actually good or not.I found the constant messages and bloodstains everywhere distracting and annoying. Sure these are probably things in the series that people who play it are used to and possibly like about the series (although every streamer I've watched ignores these, making you wonder why they exist as features)The absolutely worst thing is the PC performance issues. I have a RTX3090, AMD 3600XT, 64GB 4400mhz RAM and a PCI-E 4.0 SSD and the frame rate of the game keeps dropping down to less than 40. Not had this issue with other ""open world"" games. It's a deal breaker for me. I think the game was, like practically every AAA title, rushed out too fast and now is going to be subject to a bunch of day one patches as they rush to try and fix the issues.** UPDATED REVIEW **A lot of the performance issues have been fixed (at least for me). I would say the UI has a fair few issues and inconsistencies. For example, when trying to summon your horse the message that pops up asking if you want to use a flask to revive your dead horse is unnecessary and SO ANNOYING IT GETS YOU KILLED. People should be able to tell their horse is dead because it makes a noise when it dies and when you go to summon it, it shows a picture of a flask. Also sometimes you pick up items and it just displays it on the right side of the screen, other times it has a popup that requires you to press Y (for xbox controller) to dismiss it. So for everything I pick up, I've gotten in the habit of just mashing Y to preemptively get rid of the popup. Given the size of the world, keeping track of NPC quests is pretty much impossible. Something to give you a way to look up where your up to would've been great. I think it shows that FromSoftware haven't had much experience with massive open world games where it's difficult to keep track and where you can easily be distracted. There are also a number of areas where you spend ages exploring for nothing. Rumours are that further DLC will be released for the game.It's a fair effort but I would only recommend waiting a bit longer for some more bug fixes, finding out what the extra DLC areas are going to bring and then getting the game on special.",0
Negative,"Now that things are calming down I can only hope that Fromsoft fixes this game despite the generally positive reception that it seems to be receiving on steam now.I still can't seem to get this game to use my graphics card despite designating it in the Nvidia control panel and the Window graphics settings. So the game runs at an unplayable framerate (around 15-30fps) in the overworld and even stutters a bit in dungeons and the totally isolated and enclosed hub area. Then there is still the more major stuttering that occurs from time to time while the game seems to be loading in new assets or shaders, even though I have everything on an SSD. The only graphics setting that seems to make any difference to performance is the SSAO which needs to be turned off completely lest the game run even slower, 5-10fps. I was also experiencing some controller problems but I haven't played for long enough recently to know if those are still an issue. So in short the game exists in an unplayable state for me despite meeting the recommended system specs. This is a game that I would love to jump into but this performance makes playing it completely intolerable and I can only hope that it is fixed over the next few months. Fromsoft is a very successful studio now and releasing ports in this state really is unacceptable at this stage. It's a bad sign when people who pirate your game in order to play without the Easy anti cheat software actually end up having a better experience than those of us who attempted to support the developer and this series.",0
Negative,makes me want to absolutely thundercunt my gerbil at the wall!,0
Negative,"Has some of the worst boss and enemy design in soulsborne games, with an absurd level of antagonistic design: delayed attacks to take advantage of your reflexes and intuition, AoE spam that punishes you for daring to think you can get a hit in for the half-second recovery period the boss has, and a lot of attacks that are borderline impossible to react to just to punish you for being in melee range. So many bosses do these things that they end up feeling really samey and frustrating. The group fights are also truly lazy, with multiple bosses that are designed to be fought solo put in the same arena without any changes.Exploration is pretty entertaining for a while while everything's new, but there's significant reuse of bosses, enemies, and environments, and by the time you reach the last areas it becomes a real slog through hordes of enemies and bosses you've fought half a dozen times before. This game really would've benefited by not being open world or at least being quite a bit smaller.The first 60 hours or so are pretty good and probably worth getting the game on sale. Amazed it got so many perfect scores though, with how blatantly it exposes its own design flaws by the end.",0
Negative,"i am sure the game is great and i will change my rating when i actually get into the game play.but sweet jesus the PC controls on this game are the worst. Un-intuitive, no rhyme or reason, they didn't even bother to port over PC controls or tool tips.instead it has a window pop up to click on what the corresponding controller button would be. yay for extra steps! Oh you want to interact with an object? Great just hit the 3 parallel lines key on your keyboard.oh.the menu button on a controller? Let me just open the game setting menu and see what the corresponding key bind is for that.oh.there is not a way to tell? Great i'll just hit every button till something happens. One of the dumbest things i have ever seen in a game that has so much hype.",0
Negative,"Best game from From Software? NoSo much copy paste bosses and locations, to make game bigger. Hardness off bosses and some npcs, making no sanse. Just to make you farm and farm. In the begining game seems very nice and fun, but in the middle, you just running and farming runes, to get a least good lvl to defeat bosses and mobsSo better to play other DS games, Bloodborne or Sekiro, then this",0
Negative,"The game on its own looks fantastic and full of life, creatures and enemies look unique and for it being my first souls game, having played the first dark souls game for like 30 minutes and not touching the other games. Its reasonably beginner friendly. Pretty good.HOWEVER. This game is not optimized for pc, and the weirdest thing is that its performance with different people is wildly inconsistent. While I would consider my computer to be pretty good (2080 Super, Ryzen 7 5800), I had consistent 60fps yet would frequently freeze. A friend with a lower quality pc had NO stuttering issues, but enemies wouldnt render in correctly. ANOTHER friend had controller issues. Would not get right now unless you wish to get lucky and not have performance issues.Nothing really open in the background, and nothing peaking in task manager, really only maxes out at 50% for cpu and gpu usage. Really needs stability and optimization fixes, hopefully soon.Edit (6/14/2023): Since my original review, I have upgraded from a 2080 super to a 3080. Unfortunately, still got the same issue of the game stuttering very frequently. Didn't matter what my settings were or what I did outside of the game, such as disabling oculus or messing with nvidia settings. The game itself was fun and I eventually beat it. Maybe the problems I had are some form of user error, and maybe there was a way to fix it, but I can't recommend it based on my experience. Great game with a not 10/10 port from console.",0
Negative,"4.5/10Yeah.You've probably already heard all of the positive remarks about this game. I'm not going to spend much time marking down the things I do like about Elden Ring. But, it would be disingenuous of me if I didn't cop to something.In order:1. The Ashes of War system is cool and the build variety it opens up is great. There's a lot of room for player expression, moreso than previous titles and certainly more than Sekiro.2. Certain parts of the game are breathtaking, and the art direction is spot on for the most part.3. There's a LOT of weapons, armors, rings, etc etc. It's very easy to make your character look good and a lot of the unique weapons feel great to play with.4. Fighting boss (when it's done right) still feels pretty great. That feeling when you dodge at just the right time never gets old.Aaaand. That's kind of it. I'll be honest, it took a minute to scrounge up even that.I'm just going to go over the major elements that led to me scoring the game the way I did.THE WORLDI am incredibly critical of Open World games, perhaps to a fault. I've always struggled to find merit in these types of games, and they rarely, if ever, hook me in. The appeal for me of an open world is the prospect of a living world that I can get lost exploring in. Now, the open world concept is essentially the tagline of Elden Ring, and you spend an assload of time in it. So how does it shape up?It doesn't. Not even in the slightest bit. Now, the world isn't empty, let me make that clear ahead of time. Too often do critics of this game latch onto that word, and time and time again you'll see the fans counter with: ""No no! There's tons of stuff in the world, it's not empty at all!""And they're right! There's plenty of stuff!The problem is that it almost all sucks.There's a lot content in terms of quantity. There's countless enemies, dungeons, and merchants. But it essentially all boils down to the same routine. In the overworld? Fight some trashmobs, loot some items. In a dungeon? Fight some trashmobs, loot some items, kill a boss (WOW!), leave. There's no narrative stringing you along through any of this locations barring the main quest, and there no towns or villages to relax or morp around in. The whole world of Elden Ring is a vast expanse of nothingness with a bunch of filler riding the coattails of the main story areas, lazily hidden by your horse. We've seen this formula time and time again in games from developers like Ubisoft, usually to much criticism. But is it really that much different here, when you pull away the Soulsy veneer? Ask yourself. If it weren't for Torrent, how alive would the world feel if you were stuck on foot?LEVEL DESIGNThe level design is not good. I'm going to piss off a lot of people by saying that, but it's true. The fundamental issue with the levels in Elden Ring is that there is virtually no reason at all to fight the enemies. Fromsoft's design philosophy coalesces into a perfect storm of a lot of the time, where the inherent risks of fighting enemies almost always outweighs any of the incentive to do so. The enemies respawn if you die even once, and the Runes you're going to get from the boss will far outclass anything you're gonna scrounge out of even 100 mangy dogs, so why not just run through the whole thing? Seriously? How is that not the OPTIMAL way to play? You're routinely presented with situations where you're outnumbered and entirely outclassed by the level enemies, and fans will tell you to fight. But why? You don't have to to progress. The only thing in the way of you getting to the next area is the boss. That always nagged me about Fromsoft games, and it's made even worse here with all of the magic spam and other teeth-pulling you have to put up with. You can't tell me that Benny Hilling around the map is good game design. You just can't.QUESTLINESThe quests in this game, if you can really call them that, are bad. They're very bad. The Souls series isn't really known for its arresting side characters or engrossing B-Plots, so this isn't too much of a shock, and normally wouldn't be a huge problem for me. The issue though is that the open world nature of Elden Ring mutates the already pretentious questing system of previous games into even more of a nuisance. Here's a breakdown of the only quest I bothered completing: (with the help of a guide)1. Meet Yura Bloody Finger Hunter underneath a bridge at Limgrave Lake.2. He warns you about the dragon. This is the only thing he does, and there is no indication whatsoever of any kind of quest related to him.3. Ride clear across the lake into a random ravine. Get dismounted off your horse and fight some bloody-finger guy. Yura spawns in and then says some random dialogue about the guy you're fighting while you mash him.4. Despawns, and then reappears at the very end of the ravine in a cave. Again, no indication whatsoever about where he's at.5. Talk to him. He congratulates you and purrs at your martial prowess and then warns you about some crazy lady named Eleonora. Quest over!6. Wrong. There is now a summon sign clear across the map in Raya Lucaria at the end of a broken bridge (yes, you read that right).7. Use the summon sign, fight some random NPC with Yura. Get sent back on the bridge and be careful not to miss him! as he's now leaning on the railing behind you.8. Talk to him, get an Ash of War. Quest done!9. Wrong! Again! He teleports clear across the map. again. to a random church in the Atlus Plateau. This time you find him sprawled out near-death on the church floor, giving an opera-monologue about his beloved Eleonora. You stand around awkwardly waiting for him to croak, then loot the sword off his still-warm body.10. Just as you're about to leave, Eleonora spawns in. Gasp! You fight her and then get a pole-staff.11. Quest done!Does that not sound like the stupidest thing you've ever heard in your entire life? This appears to be the standard of Elden Ring's quests. 0 direction, 0 investment, and -0 idea about what the is going on. The way they're designed prevents you from ever really being the active agent in any of the quests you undertake. You're not experiencing the beats of a quest because you intend to, they kind of just happen to occur if you're in the right place at the right time, and if Mercury is in retrograde and the North Star is juuust bright enough. Coupling that with the fact that there's no actual decision-making expected on your part, you get the comedic impression that you're just some extra at the school play, who's so good at getting in the way that the actual actors in the show have to improvise some on the spot nonsense to keep the whole production from being torn down by your meddling. I actually busted up laughing when Yura died. It almost feels intentional.CONCLUSIONThere's a lot of other stuff I could touch on but I'm already out of space here so I'll keep this brief. If you like all of the other Souls games, you might like this. I don't for all the reasons above. Am I going to keep playing it though? Yeah, probably. Am I going to like playing it? Mmmmmm. Probably not.Look at my Dark Souls 3 hrs comaped to Elden",0
Negative,"Don't buy this if you're planning to play without a gamepad.PC port feels shoddy on the whole.The implementation of Keyboard & Mouse controls is terrible. Half the interfaces require exit with 'esc' key. The other half 'Q' key. Neither key is mentioned in the UI by default. The game will show you gamepad prompts even if you don't use gamepad. There is an option to switch the prompts to keyboard buttons but its not available by default.Keybindings menu is lackluster. There is no mention of how to switch weapon-holding. (You have to hold E and press left/right mouse buttons to do it.)You also can't bind item usage to standalone keys. They share controls with item swapping that uses arrow keys (you know, as far away as possible from wasd , or the mouse you attack with). You also are required to hold E and press the arrow keys to use them. Pretty sad.The fullscreen map cannot be traversed with the mouse. You cannot move the map nor select things with the mouse. The default binding has you jump with the F key. Weird choice for an action you'll be using common.Putting interaction key on E and healing on R feels wrong. Mistake-prone. You can luckily rebind it, but a lot of keys are stuck on you holding E, so I recommend moving the healing, instead.Camera movement feels weird, the course correction it has is jittery.Weird framerate issues. Alt tabbing can crash the game. (wasn't even in fullscreen mode)Easy-Anti-Cheat at the beginning makes the whole PC slow to a crawl for some reason. My specs aren't bad and should not be blamed for it either.All in all, the experience is extremely harmed by shoddy keyboard & mouse controls. The lack of proper item bindings makes for an inability to competently swap weapons mid-combat. Not being able to competently summon your mount on the fly, and not being able to look around properly, comfortably.I am shutting the game down after 80 minutes of playing, and will be waiting for updates. Regardless of how they may or may not come, I will not be playing it with a keyboard & mouse again. The game should not advertise itself as having full keyboard & mouse support because the implementation feels flawed enough to the extent that it should not count as such.As for actual gameplay :I don't feel like I can vouch for its story with as little time as I played. The world looks great, the creatures and objects are nicely detailed. Animations are smooth.Gameplay feels very much 'demon souls with just open plains'. Mount feels good to ride on. Jumping is floaty. Many tutorial prompts at the beginning, similar to Monster Hunter Rise in that extent. Backstab feels buggy and you have to literally caress the enemy's back for backstab to work. Somehow, bumping into the enemy's back doesn't trigger their awareness. weird.Menus are janky. Definitely not designed for PC. Not great to use.I'm giving this a bad review for the bad experience it has given me using native KBM controls. Should I ever boot it up again and see the experience is made better, this review will change.",0

Negative,"Dear diary,Today I had high expectations of going into Elden Ring, sadly it's piss poor performance reminded me of how pathetic I was for giving my ex a second chance.",0
Negative,"I want to start, saying that I'm a veteran soulsborne player so I know some things about this game series.Honestly there's so much wrong with this game I don't even know where to start.Retarded weapon-upgrading system, constantly reused bosses(5 or more tree guardians and 8 or more spirits of erd tree + my personal fav. Commander O'neel in frost location. I just wanna die because of him), balance issues in both pvp&pve. At some points game just feels unfair and there's literally nothing you can do about it. In later portion of the game almost everything kills you in 2-3 hits(with 40 vigor and health rune equiped), enemies have way too much health, considerable amount of weapons have strange stat requirements like 50str+17int (mfw?). Open world is beautiful yet a bit empty and not particularly interesting to explore even during the 1 playthrough. The reason for that is, once more, reused bosses.So, l made a conclusion that you should only buy this game if you're a diehard soulsborne fan as the game is really and l mean, really unfriendly to new players. l hope my review saves you some money and nerves.",0

Negative,"I wanna love this game, some bits of it are amazing and other bits incredibly frustrating and poorly designed which is a shame as its incredibly well made.The open world is great to explore until your realise every reward is a spell or weapon art you won't use and every dungeon uses a boss you've seen before making the world feel incredibly empty. Its clear the bosses have suffered as a result of making the game open world as they've had to repeat them so many times that they lose all their grandeur. Most ""real"" bosses feel like spectacles and aren't good fights. The combat is incredibly boring too compared to previous games. Want to play a strength character? Just jump up and down, want to play a dex character? Just Rivers of Blood, want to player a mage? Just Comet Azur. The optimal playstyle for each ""class"" is incredibly easy, the only reason not to use those methods is because you don't want to.Sadly the only song I can remember is the main theme as you hear it every time you boot up the game. Every other song sounds incredibly similar.I'm sure as your first FromSoft game its incredible but to me, it feels like a regression, great at times but disappointing in general.",0
Negative,"5/10I know this game needs to be improved, and its team needs players' support, but 44$ is too much for me. This game feels like Demons' Souls Remake with poor optimization and awkward game controls, and shares too much similarity with Dark Souls III. Kinda messy and disappointing.I always object the idea of open world, resource collection, because that just sounds like grinding for me, which doesn't correlate with good game experience. Is it wise to follow the lead of this trend in video game market?Sorry, just didn't find this game enjoyable. Maybe because I'm here for 'Souls', not The Legend of Zelda. Hard to tell.",0

Negative,"50 hours in and I have to change my review to a negative. We're nearing an entire month after launch and we still have game breaking stuttering and invisible enemy bugs. I have well above recommended specs and have tried every fix I could. Being in the middle of an absolutely unforgiving boss and the entire game freezes in place while his grunts turn invisible is incredibly frustrating. If you expect me to get good, at least make your game functional. The game is still locked at 60 fps on PC in 2022, we can run games at +3x that, why is this even a thing? Still no ultra wide support. The UI is default set to an xbox controller and you cant change it, so if you dont use that good luck navigating anything. You cant rebind all the keys individually. The game is really good when it works, but this is was designed for consoles and lazily slapped onto PC. Absolutely shameful that AAA studios are still doing this while the usual hoard of fanboys defend it and claim its better than all the other companies that do the same thing. Instead of fixing these issues, or even addressing them, theyre releasing how to play guides and pretending the game is fixed.This game is beautiful, the combat is engaging and challenging, the hitboxes are the best out of any souls game. Almost every fight feels fair(in the sense that the hitboxes or tracking isnt broken) and makes them extremely fun to learn and overcome as a result. But these bugs make the experience range from frustrating to impossible when it should not be. There is simply nothing you can do when you cant see an enemy or any of their telegraphs. Most of this is isolated to the beginner areas and is absolutely a flaw in the coding and way the engine processes in game entities. In the later areas instead of invisible enemies im getting routine crash to desktop bugs(about one an hour). The game can perfectly run massive enemies hurling hurricanes of flame at you and then has a coronary trying to render a single goat. Enemies can track and hit you through walls and then sometimes will get stuck on a chair. Cloud sync fails every time you close the game. Every time the menu pops up you have to agree to the online rules. In order to properly close the game you have to navigate to the main menu, wait for it to load, agree to the terms, and then youre allowed to quit. If you dont do this the game has a pop up next time you open telling you off for it. Im not going to complain about human behavior in an online game, but if i have to agree to behavioral terms every time i open the game, id like to not see a ton of explicit references and corresponding gestures(which violate terms) every few messages. Its the typical garbage fire PC port we are all far too used to.Im still having an ok time with it, all things considered. Time will tell if the game can work long enough for me to complete it. No doubt this laziness will be rewarded with endless positive reviews and rewards, and the cries of their community will go unheeded until they move on to the next money printer. How disappointing and predictable.",0
Negative,"I cannot recommend this game over other titles in the Fromsoftware lineup. The pros are the environments and level design are great and there s a lot of flashy weapon art moves and magic abilities. Voice acting is good too.The cons are just about everything else. A lot of my frustration with the game comes from many enemies and bosses attacking too fast and hitting too hard to get reliable punishing hits in. Boss fights feel like they were designed around you using spirit summons except these summons make the game extremely easy.I breezed through most of the game using summons once I gave up trying to solo fight anything. The side quests are a mashup of confusing dialogue where characters move around the giant world without giving you an idea of where they re going. I know this is a signature of fromsoftware games but it doesn t compliment the open-world nature of the game at all. Some side quests feel incomplete or unrewarding (such as a particular Boc ending, or what happens to Edgar, or a particular npc getting possessed randomly). Music is mostly uninspired except for a few bosses (notably godskin peelers, tree sentinels, and morgott). Enemies are recycled so often it becomes laughable. There must be about a dozen Ulcerated Tree Spirit bosses in one play through alone. Not to mention some of the final zones (such as the shunning grounds) are only comprised of enemies you ve already seen throughout the game. Making these zones feel bland and uninteresting. Overall the game is decent but not great and I think anyone new to the franchise should play a few of the older titles before reaching for this one.",0
Negative,"Performance on a high end pc with a Ryzen 5800X, 16GB RAM and a TUF 3080 is not enjoyable with these constant fps dips and 1-3 second lagsRight now i can't recommend Elden Ring to anyone until these problems are fixed.",0
Negative,"Great game with lots to explore! However, I really wish the team would use historically accurate names for the bosses. Flying Dragon Agheel is very clearly a Wyvern and the Magma Wyrm is obviously not a Wyrm. This lack of attention to detail is very off putting and ultimately makes the game not worth it. Save yourself some money and time, stick to DS3.",0
Negative,"Unfortunate i have to give everyone a big warning before buying the game. The game is not well optimised at least for the PC, and while the frame rate in enclosed areas is very stable, it will constantly stutter in open areas, from which the game will have many, since as the trailers show, you will even be able to ride on this big worldmap. Especially when a Boss makes a special move.Since Elden Ring is a game where you have to dodge/react to the opponents attacks in under a secound, this makes Bossfights frustrating beyond believe and honestly kinda unplayable at least in my eyes. I dont mind having to try a boss over and over because i make a mistake, but constantly dying, because the game freezes for 1 secound so i couldnt see which type of attack the boss is throwing at me is not the kind of challenge i am looking forward to.I hope that one of the first Patches will fix the horrible stutter problems that the game currently has, and i am really sure that once the problems are fixed, that the game will be absolutly amazing. But as for now, if you are still thinking if you should buy the game or not, i would highly recommend to wait for a while.",0
Negative,This game caused me to lose my confidence in my ability to get bitches. Dont purchase if you have frail masculinity like me.,0

Negative,"Seems amazing, but near unplayable in current state. Stuttering every time a loading zone happens (and it happens often in random parts of fields while fighting enemies) is unacceptable. Hopefully it gets fixed, but I love FromSoft games",0
Negative,"It's a terrible PC port, the game is unplayable on high end pc. This is brutally exposed in the first open world location just after the prologue. There are frequent FPS drops (to around 20) and the stuttering is unbearable. None of the tricks from the internet helped with terrible performance. If it was a different game type it wouldn't bother me that much but it's a freaking soulslike game, which is all about timing and patience and having frames drops helps with neither. It extremely discourages you from playing the game. The game itself can be brilliant but it doesn't matter to me as I can't play it. It's a negative review solely because of performance aspect.",0
Negative,"I wish there was a neutral option instead of ""recommend"" or ""don't recommend this game"". Unfortunately there is no ultrawide support in this game and it has EAC baked into the game so a simple hex edit will get you banned from playing online. I wish the game gave you an option to run the game in offline mode with EAC disabbled like Halo MCC or 7 Days to Die. I doubt flawless widescreen will be able to release an update to modify the game to get widescreen to function without getting you banned. The lack of UW support at release is disappointing. Dark Souls Remastered has UW support, why doesn't Elden Ring? I hope someone finds a workaround. For the time being I will continue to play and try to get used to the pillar box.",0
Negative,No good port?,0
Negative,"1.04.1Open world Dark Souls.The PC version isn't all that great compared to the console ones thanks to the usual case of Japanese developers not often being very good with PC games, and apparently also the fault of the implemented Easy Anti-Cheat.Easy Anti-Cheat isn't even a very good anti-cheat as you can turn it off real easily, and the game even runs a little better without it, making pirated versions of this game or just learning to disable EAC entirely give a better performance, though of course you'd lose access to online functions in this single-player heavy game. You can even cheat in items as it's disabled, re-enable it, and not get banned, at least for the case of items that aren't limited per playthrough; though it's not like you need to be online to begin with to actually play this game anyway.They're also really insistent on you using an OS with DirectX 12 despite the game being able to run on DX11 anyway with the use of a little mod and file manipulation.Just like any Souls game directed by Miyazaki, the plot itself is very simple: kill bosses and become a lord to maybe fix the world with the direction of NPC's or screwing around, or don't become lord and save the world depending on the choice of ending you unlock.The lore like in any Souls game is where it gets extremely vast, vague, and more complicated. As usual, they're mainly told through the item descriptions.Thanks to the open-world nature, the game offers loads of extremely non-linear playthrough options. Granted, some areas are obviously not meant to be explored at certain levels despite them being accessible right away, but they're still very much doable at lower levels with enough skill. After a playthrough, you can truly start going wherever with a lot more confidence.The world map is huge, and only seemingly gets progressively more massive the more you progress the game and explore. As per usual Souls game fashion, the game's also got plenty of extremely hidden secrets that are so hidden, you're more likely to stumble upon them through the online messages or just outright searching up online. The size of the secrets can range from some small crafting item to an entirely new map altogether that you can miss simply because you didn't peak around a certain corner in a small area hard enough to find the entrance.Teleporters are sometimes used as a means of accessing an area in a non-traditional manner, but they just come off as an extremely cheap method for doing so; at least there aren't actually too many of them in the game.Taking advantage of the technical mechanics in this game can be an incredibly rewarding experience.The ""stance break"" mechanic allows you to stagger enemies after enough ""stance damage"" is done to them, leaving them open to consecutive or critical attacks, but you have to take the risk of being aggressive yourself in order to bring them to that state, or take heavy advantage of the new ""guard counter"" mechanic if you're using a shield.Stealth in this game is very rewarding. When it comes to walking up to groups of enemies just idling, you can deal with them one at a time, or sneak by them completely unnoticed to reach your goal with little to no problem; you can even bait them one at a time usually, via projectile weapons or by just simply letting one see you as they don't often aggro in groups unless a ""loud sound"" by the player was made. A lot of the AI are way more exploitable than others, but that may have been intentional given that some types of enemies can very clearly see you from afar while other specific types are extremely short-sighted and even leave you alone after a short time of running away compared to some others who'll probably chase you for a lot longer.The game offers loads of character build options for both character statistics and choice of offensive options; some that can completely trivialize the hardest sections of the game. Parts of the game will punish you real hard for being a certain build or doing a certain playstyle, but all that means is that you've got to adapt to the situation, so you're not allowed to get too strict playing a certain way without taking extreme punishment for it in said specific areas.Trying to play pure melee and those that treat this game like a traditional action game which it isn't tend to get heavily punished here, or at the very least when fighting the bosses thanks to their combo-intense attacks combined with the game engine's input delay & buffer mechanics. For example, dodge rolls come out a few frames after you let go of the button, so at times, the game leans a little towards you predicting an attack rather than reacting to it, a lot more so than any other Souls game. Thanks to the input buffer mechanics of the game, you can even roll unintentionally as soon as you press the dodge button after you get staggered by an enemy attack, which bosses can punish thanks to many of them having specific combos that punish panic rolls.If you're not comfortable with your current build, you can find & unlock a re-spec mechanic that costs a specific item per use, which is limited per playthrough. Or you can back up your save file for an unlimited amount of testing.Side content, or at least the side dungeons, can get extremely mundane. Their level designs are all unique, but they all look similar to one another in terms of aesthetics. Even worse is that there's a re-used enemy or boss at the end of each one, and probably half of them have multiples at the same time for you to fight at once. In fact, the game in general just has a bad habit of re-using enemies & seemingly unique bosses throughout the game world, making the seemingly unique bosses feel a lot less special when encountered a second or fifth time. Dragons are probably the best example of this, as almost every dragon in the entire game uses the exact same moveset for you to exploit minus one or two attacks unique to the area-specific one most of the time.The game itself has got a lot more downsides aside from the ones that have been mentioned, like the quest system designed for the previous Souls game being horrendous here, not having the respawn point just be next to all the boss doors like some already do, the constant use of awkwardly delayed attacks from enemies & bosses just to throw off bad dodge rolls, the poise stat for the player character being almost as worthless as in Dark Souls 3, ""Body Type A/B"", and even more, but I found the positives to outweigh them just enough. You're still probably better off playing a console version if possible though.",0

Negative,"the entire lategame actually sucks serious ass. Even with 60 vigor and 40% physical absorption enemies will still 2 or 3 shot you, it's way too overtuned to the point it's not even fun to play, just outright frustrating. It feels like trying to play Nioh 2 NG+, if you know, you know.I'm almost certain that they had accidentally tuned certain areas to be in some NG+ cycles already in your first playthrough. There's absolutely 0 sense in a crippled woman shooting arrows stuck in place to be doing 300+ damage per shot (after defences) and having 4k HP. If you think that's not too bad then that's not even all of it as there's always multiple of them sniping at you.Try to have fun in the game, but if you start getting frustrated with areas and just feel like the power scaling in enemies starts to curve a bit too much then know I completely agree with you. I'd say that this steep curve of power creeping in enemies starts around just before you enter Leyndell proper, at the Draconic Tree Sentinel. One of the worst things From could've done is to re-add dogs (not wolves, different moveset), rats and thralls animations. If you know these enemies from DS3, then you're gonna have a great experience with this game :).Poise is back, but only somewhat, kinda like that special cousin you know. The reason for that is because almost every weapon deals insane amounts of poise damage except daggers, whips and er, something else. For example a One-handed scythe does ~92 poise damage. The only way you can achieve this amount of poise is to equip very heavy armour AND use a talisman to boost it further. It's just weird.I would rather DS3's hyper armour back than this half-baked mechanic. I say that because it seems the trade off for having this dumbed down version of poise is infinite stunlocking and even getting stunned from bleeds and frostbites out of rolls. Remember in DS3 how after getting hit twice you were given a free roll away, even amongst a blender of phantoms swinging at you? Well now you don't have that anymore, welcome to the blenderzone b#tch!Bleed is broken, and not just bleed damage, like the actual mechanic is just outright broken in an exploitative kind of way. No matter how much robustness you stack on, Corpse Piler will still bleed you in 2 hits. Dual wielding two bleed infused weapons (which had innate bleed before infusion), apparently cause you to instantly bleed (exploit?). So basically if you see someone wearing a white mask with a hood, and they are wielding either two katanas or naginata's just finger out, it's a waste of time bothering with them.Colossal weapons jump attacks are pretty broken, they deal insane amounts of damage. I was instantly killed by a host who was dual wielding colossal hammers despite my 2.1k hp, 141 flat defence and 35% physical absorption, which means the jumping L1 had to have done more than 3000 damage without defence values lmfao? (which is more damage than HP you can even get in this game even with 99 vigor and HP boosting talismans LMFAO) Makes sense for them to be so overtly broken with their jumping attacks though because their normal movesets are garbage. Though I think this might be for only some colossal weapons, because I've noticed this only with some weapons.",0
Negative,"Its with a heavy heart I cannot reccommend this with confidence. Massive souls fan which would explain the patience to even play this game as long as I did. Half of the time so far invading people with about 800 successful invasions. I hope this type of game is NOT what From decides to do going forward and since Steam doesnt allow me a ""Meh"" im stuck with thumbs down. This game is so poorly made I dont think id buy another Open World souls.This game runs like complete ass. I have above minimum specs and will still stutter in most areas. Turns out this its an issue with even the highest of quality PCs. Constant and frequent disconnects from all forms of multiplayer. Whether its beind forcibly disconnected half way through a boss, 4 minutes into helping a friend through a level, or mid fight with a host and his 2 phantoms. Half of all your multiplayer sessions will be forcibly disconnected with zero recourse. Some blame EAC but who knows.This is the part of the game I blame for most of its frustrating and boring shortcomings. Anything and everything to deal with your horse makes the game worse. Horse combat is boring with 2 attacks and being constantly thrown off by weirdly inconsistent damage. Your horse doesnt scale at all either making late game horse combat completely pointless (or subsequent playthroughs) when the air of a weapon swing will instantly kill your mount.The reused and copy pasted content in this game is absolutely pathetic. The overworld having the same 3 knights plastered on every inch of the massive map with slight reskins. The dozens of Catacombs all looking the same, with slightly different layouts, and exclusively filled with 1 enemy or if lucky the occasional skeleton. Insultingly so with specific bosses. Fighting Tree Avatar 12 times, Ulcerated Tree Spirit 6, Stone Gargoyle Guardian's ~10, Tibia Mariner 4-5, same Dragon 6+, magma wyrm 3. Numerous occassions where the boss is just an enemy you already fought in the same ""dungeon"" just with a slighter higher HP. Double bosses are everywhere. They simply take two normal enemies you've fought dozens of times before, slap them together in the same room, and call it a boss. They even have the audacity to reuse bosses that could be really cool if not copy pasted somewhere else. Like Astel, Mohg, Godfrey, Loretta.This Open World does have 1 advantage. You can on subsequent playthroughs safely ignore 80% of the content and not miss anything at all. Literally never enter a catacomb for any reason and you're good to go.This coincides with the reused content. Not much should need to be repeated about how terrible fighting the same bosses constantly is. Bosses especially in the later half of the game are terrible and I dont see how people defend them. They clearly decided to go style over substance with alot of them.Radahn's obnoxious approach, massive swings and combos, hyper mobility, weird gimmick of summoning useless NPCs, and his beyond stupid appearance and mechanics. Malenia's Waterfowl dance, dash multi hit, and Phase two phantom attack. Elden Beast being a giant middle finger to melee builds. Astel being the same with him being 10 feet off the ground, AoE attack you cant dodge or jump over when in melee range, and ability to teleport the other side of its arena. Fire Giant period. Godskin duo being two bosses you've fought twice already before, having more then the duo's HP bar and actually being a 4 boss fight, and fatroll. Even everyone's first casual filter Margit has janky bullshit. Knife double slash, staff into hammer swing. Two attacks that WILL catch you mid roll because of how they're staggered. Again frequent disconnects. Half of invasions will be dropped. Some people like to tout the game is balanced because everything is broken. This isnt true at all. Maybe every stat has something OP but most weapons/playstyles are not even close to being useful.Forced gank squads by players only being invadable by either Summoning a co-op partner first or using a specific item to allow multiple people to invade. Soul's shit netcode somehow being even worse with invisible phantoms and laggy or completely invisible spells hitting you in one massive clump. Password system allowing for most invasions to have a phantom in it more then double your level or sometimes people at the level cap. Ive earned 950,000 runes from killing a phantom before. Its common to earn 50-100k runes while invading people at level 25 from bad players summoning their friends.Faith has Madness which abuses shitty netcode for guranteed stuns/damage. Dragon skills that have massive undodgeable AoEs. Made worse by Rot breath inflicting a NASTY status. Intelligence has Moonveil and Stars of Ruin. Dex is like normal better then everything else but not because of the normal damage Dex does. Status effects are insanely strong in this game. Bleed is beyond abuseable and if it doesnt proc in 1 hit from certain builds its going to proc in 2 or 3 for a stun and half your HP bar. Freeze/bleed builds are everywhere and cannot be matched by anything else in the game for PvP or PvE. Because of said Frost they still end up doing higher damage with Magic/Phys split with zero stat investment. Statues are so broken that even STR users two handing 60 STR weapons are lowering their Phys damage for that sweet Frost.Really any blood art bleeds and does way to much damage. While I understand not every Ash will be perfectly balanced alot of them are. Most are good and useable but theres a very select few that dominate the game, are not balanced, and sit comfortably way above everything else.Jumping and crouching add numerous additional moves and make combat more interesting and varied. The heaviest weapons while still terrible in this game wouldnt even be useable at all without jumping attacks. Collosal sword's crouch poke, dual whips jump attack, alot of dual weapons sprint attacks.Edit: Taking out the part about bug abuse, Hoarfrost, and bleed slash. Not even hours after I intially posted this review From dropped a patch which removed the bugs and nerfed the Ashes. Status is still the same.I havent mentioned PvE anywhere else because from a balance perspective I dont actually care if players use things like Mimic Tear. Its a summon restricted exclusively to single player. I dont care how players play by themselves.The normal level design is still in this game and its just as quality as ever. If not better because of added verticality with jumping. Stromveil, Haligtree, Academy, Ruins Precipice, Caria Manor, Volcano, and others. All normal Soul's level natually placed into the world. They make heading through the 19th catacomb with 1 enemy type, a reused bose, and for a single spirit summon at the end seem even worse by comparison.Game isnt bad but its the worst Souls game From has made inargueably. More content does not mean GOOD content. Its about 40-50 hours of content streched and reused into 80-100. Some additions are great but muddied like Ashes of war. Things like Jumping and its added gameplay is amazing. PvP is playable technicly but only the most sadistic SoBs who enjoy stomping the odd new player more then they get frustrated from disconnecting from half their invasions or being 3v1 magic spammed. Game is about a 6/10 currently and after some patches to maybe improve its performance and hopefully balance out some of the game breaking stuff. It may go up to a 7/10. People stating its a masterpiece havent played more then a couple hours of it.",0
Negative,"EDIT:They fixed the controller issues, it works fine now.Performance is still a problem.-I can't judge the game on it's own merits, since it just won't acknowledge my PS5 controller. As of now, my ""adventure"" has been 0.5 hours of applying potential fixes, starting the game again to be disappointed once more - rinse and repeat.Apart from that, my mouse cursor stutters in the menu, my refresh rate gets randomly reset to 30Hz and borderless window behaviour is wonky at best. I will cease my troubleshooting efforts in order to preserve valuable time before I lose the ability to refund the game. Also, I will change my negative rating (if warranted) should they fix the issues before my refund window closes (~2 weeks).As of now, this port looks and feels atrocious - especially given the track record of From Software - and I can't recommend it.",0
Negative,"I have mixed feelings when reading review that give the game poor rating because the game is not working, it has DRM (denuvo) or bugs for example. The reviews should be about how good the game is not how it runs on YOUR system, or should it?If the game runs fine for you, it is a great game. I recommend it.If it is freezing, slowing down, stuttering or crashing it is not that great to play. Imagine fighting a boss, and when you are about to beat it, the game freezes for 0.5 secs, and you are dead. You can`t even blame the controller. Should I blame the computer setup? Maybe, the game runs pretty much the same on minimum and max settings which is bit odd.",0
Negative,"I have over 500 hours in Elden Ring, with 90% of that coming from the PS4 version. I've beaten it three times and ""platinumed"" it twice. You could rightly say that I really enjoy this game, and I'll definitely be playing it for longer still.Unfortunately, I also despise this game, making it the first thing I've ever had a genuine love-hate relationship with. So, as much as I enjoy it, it only really deserves a 6 or 7 out of 10 instead of a full 10 or even a 9. This game gets praised plenty already, so I won't waste time on why it's good and instead get right to the glaring flaws.Frankly, the boss design is shit. Yes, shit, and there's no excusing it given From Software's alleged track record of making ""challenging but fair"" bosses for as long as they have. Virtually every significant boss in the game suffers from hyper aggressiveness and excessively long combo strings. Good luck finding a decent opportunity to attack (or heal), because as soon as you do, the boss *will* immediately begin attacking again, barely giving you one or two hits to land while they get to throw out 20 hits with like two seconds of down time. Bosses also have way too many delayed attacks that are more there to punish reasonably anticipated dodges than to punish panic rolling. A way of artificially increasing the difficulty, essentially. Their movepools are overly bloated and have every single tool at their disposal to reach you: far reaching lunge attacks, jump attacks, projectile attacks, AND AoE attacks to boot. They just don't let up.To top it all off, the majority of bosses (and even enemies), especially during the late game, deal way too much damage and can 1-2 shot you even if you've peaked at 60 vigor (the final softcap, giving you 1900 HP). All of these issues add up to bosses being less about skill and ""learning the fight"" and more about, ""How fast can I DPS this boss with my own bullshit before they delete my health bar in two seconds?"" Because yeah, fair and balanced gameplay or something.Compared to the PS4, the co-op experience on PC is mediocre to terrible. I regularly get disconnected despite there being seemingly no lag and with my Wi-Fi being stable with 4-5 bars; I've been disconnected while exploring dungeons, the open world, and fighting bosses at *least* ten times. and I've only done co-op for like two days. Meanwhile, I can count on one hand the number of times I've had issues like this on the PS4.My last point of contention with the game is with the worldbuilding. I know From Software likes their bleak, deserted environments because something something grimdark apocalyptic fantasy style, but their usual formula does NOT work well with an open-world game like this one. Despite the narrator at the start saying, ""Our home, across the fog, the Lands Between,"" there is virtually nobody living there to make it a home. There are no settlements or groups of inhabitants of any kind; the only ""inhabitants"" are your staple mindless zombies and like, 10 NPCs you can talk to scattered throughout the game. These issues remind me a lot of some of the critiques brought up with Fallout 4; they mentioned how the setting has remained unnecessarily empty and devastated like it's recently been nuked, with no evidence of rebuilding or resettling to match with the centuries that have passed. Considering the Lands Between did experience their own devastating war seemingly generations ago, this critique applies here too.All that said (and despite my negative review), is Elden Ring enjoyable? Yes. Is it ""good""? Sure. Should you get it? If you want to (hell, I even bought a copy for a friend of mine), and you'll probably enjoy it. But be aware that the game does NOT have the best design in its primary selling points.",0
Negative,"These are just my quick thoughts after completing the game and becoming Elden Lord. I admire a lot of what From Software has accomplished here, but I can't really say I enjoyed the experience. What would otherwise be a well realized and enthralling open world is constantly undermined by poor combat and laughably unbalanced design decisions. A gorgeous open world (sometimes) - While Elden Ring isn't the prettiest game I've ever played, it's definitely striking at it's best moments. The art design is absolutely phenomenal, and most of the assets on display here are of very high quality. My only gripe is the game's overbearing use of scenery obscuring fog effects. It was very hard to tell sometimes whether this was done for atmosphere, or to hide issues with pop-in and draw distance. A journey into mystery - The world of Elden Ring is fraught with peril, with the prospect of sudden death around every corner. While I have many criticisms about the particulars of how this was accomplished, I have to admit it really contributes to the atmosphere and feel of the world. Many open world games can feel like you're carelessly bee-lining between points of interest on a banal quest to complete a checklist. The almost oppressive sense of danger that pervades the Lands Between, combined with how little direct instruction you are provided, gives everything an irresistible sense of mystery that compels you to keep exploring.A poor port - Elden Ring on PC is kind of a mess. Even when everything was working properly, my play sessions were still accompanied by the tinnitus roar of my RTX3090 struggling mightily to run this game at 1440 resolution. When things weren't going so well, I experienced framerate issues across all settings and sudden ejections from the game whenever a connectivity issue cropped up. As I mentioned, the game looks quite nice, but given how often the draw distance is obscured by fog, it's shocking how much strain it put on my system. The lack of any kind of DLSS support for Nvidia cards doesn't help matters either.Passive-aggressive AI - While struggling against many of this game's bosses, I often noticed that if I simply hung back at mid-range and did nothing, the AI seemed to have no idea what to do next. It would awkwardly shuffle back and forth, or trudge towards me slowly, trying to back me into a corner. Almost every beating I took was retaliation for one of my actions rather than initiative from the opponent. Most enemies only have a handful of attacks that can be safely punished, and they tend to be very conservative in using these. The passive aggressive tendencies of the AI are made much worse by the fact that it reads inputs the same way older fighting games used to. As soon as you press the button to heal, before your animation even begins, the boss has already started to lunge at you. This also applies to NPC invader characters, who's ability to dodge your every attack with millisecond timing beggars belief. You're left in a kind of double bind where every action you take is punished before the windup even finishes, yet the enemy is perfectly happy to stand there and do nothing if you play too defensively. I would frequently find myself and a boss slowly circling each other for minutes on end while I yelled ""DO SOMETHING"" at the TV, waiting for the one safe opportunity where I would be allowed to do damage.Nonsensical enemy attack patterns - When enemies do attack, they simply have no regard for weight or momentum. A giant the size of the Chrysler Building will deftly spin on it's heels to track you before swinging his ax. Bosses will leap into the air, hang there like Wiley Coyote, turn to track you IN MID AIR, then slam back down on top of you. Many times an enemy will lurch forward with a huge strike, seemingly committing everything they have to the attack, only to suddenly turn on a dime with another hit the moment you close in to punish. Almost all enemy armaments other than arrows will clip right through walls and the terrain, allowing you to be stabbed, smashed, and blown up by enemies who aren't even in the same room as you. What's worse, most enemies are not subject to friendly fire, allowing them to gleefully stab their weapons through each other with no consequences, creating an impenetrable phalanx of sword and spear strikes. All of this combines to undermine any ability of the player to rely on intuition during combat. The bizarre attack patterns of enemies and their disregard for the laws of physics means rote memorization of their behaviors and weaknesses is mandatory. Painfully, this can only be accomplished through the unbelievably frustrating process of trial by death.The most unbalanced 'souls' game ever - If you try to play Elden Ring like a traditional 'souls' game, you may as well be digging a hole to hell with a tablespoon. It's certainly not impossible, but for me it was a miserable experience. The unreasonably low margin of error you are saddled with for most of the game may eventually lead you to resort to META (most effective tools available), and good lord do some of those tools break the game. Items like the Sword of Night and Flame and the Mimic Tear outclass just about everything else by such a wide margin it isn't even funny. Any weapon with a spammable AOE ability or ranged magic attack can trivialize the challenge, as the passive-aggressive AI is highly dependent on you coming close enough for their tantrum combos to be unavoidable. Add a spirit ash summon with more HP than the boss itself, and you are almost guaranteed victory 90% of the time. Unfortunately it isn't very fun or satisfying to play this way. It also makes exploration very unrewarding, given most of the gear you find will not fit the hyper optimized build necessary to wield your meme weapon of choice. When I say this game is unbalanced, I mean that there just isn't a lot of middle ground between it being either an absolute death march, or all but beating itself as you spam mimic bro and unlimited comet azure.What we are left with here is an amazing journey that is unfortunately married to a ridiculously obnoxious game. It hypocritically demands players submit to rules of weight and inertia while its fat bosses careen around like ninja stars and stab you through solid walls. The fact that you can cheese the game right back with your own totally broken nonsense did little to make the experience more fun for me. The world itself made it worth hanging in there, but I'm in no hurry for new game plus and am not happy I spent $60 for a game that still requires a lot of technical polish. This one might be worth checking out further down the line when it's cheaper, a bit more polished, with maybe some of the balance smoothed out, but right now I wouldn't recommend it.EDIT: Just found a hilarious video on Youtube that perfectly illustrates the often ridiculous ways this game abuses input reading.",0

Negative,"This is a hard review to write because I really wanted to enjoy this game. I will try not to be long winded.Elden Ring has a beautifully crafted world that is a ton of fun to explore. It was a genuinely a joy to ride Torrent across the land and discover dungeons and NPCs and hidden nooks and crannies. The boss designs are varied and unique. Unfortunately that is where my compliments for the game end.Combat, arguably the most important aspect of the game, is unpleasant and remarkably unfair. Enemies of even the lowest caliber will constantly read your inputs in the most blatant ways, reacting to your inputs before your character has made a single movement. Bosses do this as well and it leads to frustrating encounters.The bosses of Elden ring, in large part, are very similar to Dark Souls 3 in that they rarely give you the opportunity to breathe, while peppering in elements of Sekiro boss design in that they can decide to turn their combo into one of 3 or 4 other combos if not cancel it altogether. You can go into a boss fight dozens of times over and rarely see the same moveset twice and because of this, they feel the opposite of rewarding. I enjoy Dark Souls bosses for the ability for you to die, learn, and come back with more knowledge and better preparedness to approach the boss again. It never feels like the cycle takes place in Elden Ring and in fact it feels like attempting to actually learn a bosses patterns does nothing but impede me. Eventually I acquiesced and started running spells that would decimate bosses with relative ease, but in the end it felt less like I was being rewarded and more like I was obligated to play this way. Certain styles of play feel completely unusable, and I found that to be unacceptable.All in all, I consider Elden Ring to be a game with grand potential, held back in grand measure by its sub par combat.",0
Negative,"""This game is too hard!""Miyazaki: ""Get better at it, then.""Everything does way too much damage.""Miyazaki: ""Get better at dodging, then.""There's no good reason that all of these bosses have so many attacks with purposely delayed swings.""Miyazaki: ""Get better at dodging on reaction over muscle memory, then.""This enemy/boss is subjectively unfair.""Miyazaki: ""Get better at it, then.""The camera is terrible, it just swings around and never has an affixed position outside of less fights than fingers on my hands.""Miyazaki: ""Get better at spinning your camera around in free aim mode before the enemy snipes you in the back, then.""All of these side quests end with the NPC dying for no good reason.""Miyazaki: ""It's for the plot!""I never find a weapon that I can use for my build.""Miyazaki: ""Get better at finding them, then.""There's no way that I'm supposed to know that this NPC appears at this place after I move along their side quest.""Miyazaki: ""Get better at finding the NPCs, then.""Why do I have to fight Radagon before every time I want to fight the Elden Beast? It should be like Gehrman and the Moon Presence.""Miyazaki: ""Get better at no-hitting Radagon, then.""This type of weapon is underpowered, can you buff it?.""Miyazaki: ""Pick a better weapon, then.""The entire premise of the game being intentionally hard acts like a shield that the developers can pull out in order to deflect any valid criticism of the game, whether it from me or anyone else. This entire game is so big, but there's literally nothing to do except loot and kill people like a Mongol, and do side quests that give good items for characters that are extremely forgettable due to a lack of personality and emotion, and especially given the fact that likely over half of them die at the very end.Reusing content is the main way Fromsoft ""populates"" the place with content, the regular enemy you just fought is probably a boss with a little more health and damage in one of the many repetitive dungeons outside of the purposely unique ones, and vice versa. Hell, they even reused the first demi-god, Godrick, for an evergaol (what in the world is an evergaol, btw?), and all they did was rename him to ""Godefroy the Grafted"". Again, the map is so big, yet feels so small because you're never going to be exploring every corner of it when it becomes a chore just to wade through piles and piles of enemies just for some item you don't even want, or better yet nothing at all.The story is basically the same as Dark Souls as well, except replace a few keywords and the Dark Soul with the Elden Ring, make it more obtuse and you're good. Rune Arcs are literally just reskinned Humanity or Embers, except they come in a bunch of flavors (you're only going to be using Godrick's and Morgott's most likely, and Mohg's for invasions, since most of them are really gimmicky or underwhelming in comparison). Even the Graces are just Bonfires, but look even worse because it's just a particle effect suspended in the air. I felt next to nothing fighting any of these bosses except Godfrey and Mohg, because most of these fights are just a bunch of nonsense about this great and mighty warrior or sorcerer or evil person - all of which is very shallow - and then you get to the boss, and you beat them. It's hard to say the same for Radahn though, since I was a bit too overleveled before fighting him, and he did have some cool attacks. You don't feel like they are a character or anything, all you see is a slab of meat, a strong enemy that you have to kill, you barely ever get attached to any of them because by the time you see them they're dead faster than Millicent. The only bosses that don't instantly disappear forever when you beat them are Renalla, Morgott and Godrick, with Renalla just becoming an emotionless stat changer, and the last 2 just turn into shriveled corpses that say some dramatic nonsense before dying, not even with a flashy animation or anything, just falling over. If you want to make a good fight, a memorable one, there needs to be buildup, you need to get to know who you are fighting strong and well and grow intimate with them from afar before you face them down. It's also obnoxious that we somehow kill everyone except Renalla through the death animation, when it would have been a lot better if we were still able to converse with them after they were defeated, just something at all to grow more close with these characters, something to give them a mind and spirit into their stone carcass frozen colder than Medusa's glare.This game has the same highs as Dark Souls, and more lows. The most satisfaction you will get from playing is a dopamine rush after beating a tough enemy, or getting an overpowered item. Not much else warrants any interest, much less a feeling of achievement. The most fun, however, you will ever have playing this game, is multiplayer, whether it be reading the hundred-thousand variations of ""try finger, but hole"", genuinely funny or useful messages, helping others or striking them from the face of the earth, it's the only thing that makes the world feel not totally monotonous and lifeless. My favorite has to be ""Try aristocrat"" with the laying down emote ontop of the guillotine in the Subterranean Inquisition Chambers.",0
Negative,"Game bricked a save file at 80+ hours played, sl 200+ preparing to go into ng+ to finish out achievements.

I have no backup for it, so I'm back to square one unless they somehow fix the corrupted file. Trying to reinstall the game and see if it works then, but from what I see of others having the issue I'm just SOL.The game itself is honestly probably the best souls game ever. The bosses and world are incredible and the combat is so good.

The fact that I cannot play online and have to have a mod just to fix this is absolutely ridiculous.",0
Negative,"I beat this gameI got every achievementThe bulk of my hours were spent exploring every last crevice I could find. It took me less than 6 to make my final run. And I can say with certainty, this is the best badly-made game you can find.I did not 100% this game because I enjoyed it, I 100%'d this game as a big 'Fuck you' to anyone that wants to say 'Get gud' or call this game well made. You don't need to get good to beat this game. It is not a competently made game. *You* barely need to be competent. You just need to follow whatever cheese strat is made for a boss.To explain my personal venture, I went through the entire game, through every single boss and dungeon (excepting the ones that it wouldn't be feasible to complete due to damage type resistance) with default Uchigatana and default ashes of war on that katana, and wore the default samurai armor (Sans helmet, which was swapped with regularity) until I achieved the white version of that armor. I used no spells, no incantations, and no ashes of war. I rarely summoned others to my world, doing so for the sake of playing with a friend which only lasted a couple dungeons because constant connection errors. The exceptions to this were Twin Gargoyles, a boss which is just two bosses at the same time, and Malenia, bullshit incarnate. Don't get me wrong, you are going to play this game, and you are going to enjoy it. Maybe even most of it, but especially the starting area. Things are hard, but fair. Mistakes are your own to make and resolve. But the more you play, the more tedious it will get, the more empty the world will become, the more repetitive everything gets, and the more bosses are built around the concept of 'What is the most exhausting thing we can throw at the player' over any actual competency in game design. Now to actually break down the game;First off, controls are shit. The camera is shit. The actual UI is simple enough to understand, but it is not a pleasant thing to interface with, and the way it meshes into the game is quite clunky. Sometimes the controls will feel unresponsive, and there is a stupid button queue system that will sometimes lead you to do seemingly random inputs even half a second apart from what you wanted to change to. There is no reason for this to happen other than poor game design. The camera is something that will often be a bigger threat to manage and deal with than the enemies themselves. There are a LOT of enemies that love to fly up above your head. You cannot target them. Sometimes, if you are able to target them, your camera will flicker across the screen and break contact, completely ruining your orientation, and that enemy will be moving far beyond the last position. Enemies like this cannot be tracked, and enemies that do this are probably about to shove a sword up your asshole, so you're going to have to properly orient yourself to dodge and probably fail at both. I could go on more, but frankly, controls and camera are probably the least of the game's problems. Exploration.It's actually really fun and enticing, a great way to get that dopamine hit of searching and looting, until you realize you're never going to touch 90% of the items in your pack and it's a way to mask a completely dead and empty world. Sure, there is an enemy around every corner, and sometimes the geography is cool, but in the end you're going through the exact same ruins in the final 'secret' endgame stage that you were in the very first stage, just that this pillar is knocked over instead of that one. The geography is tedious to navigate, because the same fall you've made a dozen times might kill you on the 100th time because you double jumped instead of dropping off, or you hit a rock jutting out slightly and somehow that's enough to make a completely safe fall into a lethal one. Cliffs are everywhere, choked routes are everywhere, and you'll often need to find the singular obscured ledge that will let you drop down or climb up to reach the next area (Which this isn't really something I had a problem with personally, but it's something I know people would find greatly annoying). The worst part though is the platforming. Why does it exist? Because fuck you that's why. And it's *everywhere*. It's never difficult. At its hardest, you have to make a particularly long jump that requires basic timing. But the controls are *bad*. The only time you will ever fail these segments is because you were completely careless, or your character did something you didn't want them to do. This goes doubly if you're playing on a controller- Dodging and sprinting must be assigned to the same key, so if you're in a very confined space and wanna do a sprint jump, which will happen often, you're gonna have to hop back first and completely destroy your positioning, or send yourself hurtling backwards off the ledge. Again, this isn't even the worst part of the experience, it's just more tedium to deal with, and no reason for it. And even with all of this, I wouldn't even be that upset at such an empty world if were thematic. But super-secret areas could theoretically be accessed with a good rope, and ladders Enemies.Are fun to face the first time, not so much the fiftieth time. You're gonna be hitting the same assholes you did at the start of your journey as you are in the final steps, with a few exceptions. The difference is that now they have more HP and deal more damage. Regardless of how you developed your character, unless you're wildly overleveled the only real difference is that you'll either kill them in a couple of hits less, or they will kill you with less hits (These can both be true and inversed). Enemy placement is rarely clever- When they try and do something new, it's something along the lines of 'Put the most frustrating thing to deal with in the situation, and copy-paste it a whole lot around the field'. Combat.Roll roll roll roll roll roll roll. If you aren't rolling, you're dying. This is where the real tedium of the game is highlighted. Sure, the shield can be useful in a vague handful of situations, parrying in even fewer, but all the annoying shit can only be avoided by rolling around, and waiting until you get that small window of opportunity to strike back- Probably miss it because the enemy is faster than you- And keep on rolling. Bosses are the worst for this- Engaging with a boss has one of three results. You are NOT over-leveled, so you get a balanced and rewarding boss fight. You ARE overleveled, so you steam roll the boss. Or, for a little variety- The boss has a bullshit mechanic (or several of them), so you have to overcome that mechanic and then roll the boss. Most of the time, this mechanic is just learning the specific instance where you are supposed to roll amidst a bunch of misleading animations and false-starts, or learn the specific instance at the end of a combo where the enemy is vulnerable to attack. This isn't working out a puzzle, it isn't testing your wits, this is working out a very basic math equation combined with quick-time events without the prompt appearing on screen. Quests and Story. Are terrible. The story is generic tragedy stacked with shallow storytelling and abstract 'Look how deep I am for not explaining anything' bullshit. You might have the occasional setpiece that details some grievous or wonderful thing, but it's never anything complicated or special. Radahn seems to be everyone's favorite, so let's actually break him down- He's a general, got infected, loves a horse, something vague and handwavy about how he trapped the stars, people want to give him a warrior's sendoff. That's literally it. This is literally every warrior trope combined into a completely unoriginal giant. The only interesting implication is that he trapped the meteor to prevent it from striking down- And he's still probably the best character in the game. Everyone is melodramatic and 'Tragic' if they're not a buffoon. I hit the text limit.",0

Negative,Everything of the game is perfect but the thing that very annoying me while playing is connection error when co-op mode you should fix this problem I will not change into positive until you fix. I disconnect from my friend session every 2 mins. FIX THIS BANDAI FIX IT,0
Negative,"Game deserve praise but only for its first half and scenery. Late game and combat is a massive disappointment.Lot of enemies are just reskins using same moveset just with higher numbers, hell some enemies are just copy pasta from Dark souls 3. Enemies just feel like they are non-stop pressing attack button and never gas out. There very few enemies that get staggered or can have their endless combos interrupted while you can staggered to death by anything, even things like poison clouds make your character look like it has seizure. The fact that lot of enemies have delayed attacks to catch players rolling too early doesn't help make fights any better, lot of times it looks very unnatural and downright goofy. Frankly some enemies just slowly winding up their attacks for few seconds and holding weapon over their head but then being able swing at blinding speed just looks funny. I get that they are trying to make player pay attention to when attack is going to connect react rather than roll when enemy twitches but frankly make enemy wind up for long time and then swing in a instant is a cheap way to go. Its also painfully obvious that lot of enemies have input-read scripts for when you attack or heal just to punish you for pressing a button, again this feels like very cheap and degenerate design. Perfect 360 tracking of attacks just adds to feel of cheapness, massive enemies that can do 180 mid swing and even mid air is just hilarious. It feels like i'm playing this slowpoke of a character with few attacks while enemies can attack endlessly and jump around at the speed you can only dream of.Frankly most fights devolve into playing defensive and rolling around for 10-20s just to get one hit in, unless boss jumps away or decides to go straight into another combo. Its tedious and boring design.Another problem when you get past certain point is just massively bloated health bars and damage numbers of enemies, dying to 2 hits on 60 vigor sucks and not just from bosses but also regular enemies, hell I even got one-shot few times by regular assassins in royal capital. Massive enemy health bars just make you feel like you are forced into few builds which sucks because there is so many weapons, spells and skills in game but 95% is useless later into game.I had lot of fun with DS3, replaying the game with different builds and play-styles. There was this distinct feeling when dying a lot and then finally beating bosses in DS3 like ""Damn I should have dogded that, nvm I'll get better"" and ""Wow, this was hard but nice fight"" when you finally win. In Elden Ring its more feeling of ""lmao what a cheap bullshit"" and ""Glad this shit is over"" when you get past the enemies. This game has the worst bosses and combat from souls games and is definetly not worth replaying.",0
Negative,"It's not okay that hype and everything besides performance always seem to overshadow the simple fact that the engineering side of things isn't up to par with the rest of the game.I could overlook a lot of performance issues but 'Radahn' killed it for me.This fight is clearly a complete fiasco.Entering the boss's room alone wrecks performance so hard he himself thinks it's still pre alpha!I'm not even taking into consideration the adds fighting on your side nor the meteor effect.This boss is clearly over the technical limitations and it shows.For a game creating such a myth about player skill it's quite obvious that those things should be ruled out in production!Hoping to not get one shot in a framedrop seems quite skilled to me.Edit:'Maliketh' joins the pre alpha club and outshines 'Radahn' by being even less performant!I haven't had the pleasure to experience slide show gaming and that combined with the necessity to react in time is the true challenge this game has to offer.So if you truly wanna hate the world and nourish that masochistic rage baby inside of you then the stage is yours! But seriously, it's awful. Besides that game is quite good and deserves some praise especially the open-world addition fits perfectly.Don't buy it on PC though, performance of every game should be the foundation of every title and the industry as a whole delivers to little quality on the technical end.",0
Negative,"I'll preface this; I love Dark Souls 1 & 3. And the start of Elden Ring is one of the best souls games you've ever played. With amazing area and enemy design and interesting lore,Elephant in the room time,Getting to Altus and seeing re-used bosses made me scared for what the rest of the game was going to be like.The end game is a slog of recycled bosses and enemies you saw in the first 50 hours but ""wow now there's 2 of them!"" or they're doing 3x damage, even in main progression fights. 0 respect for the player's time.Samey feeling dungeons, forts and overworld biomes with enemies from every region of the game's world dropped in like it's Lost Izalith. it leaves you desperate for something new (especially if you feel have the compulsion to check every area you see like myself). Then when you do get something new, it's a boss with bullshit attacks that can 1 shot you or your summon and heal the boss for 40% of their hp bar.I play these games for PvP mainly and I can't even do that,Without a doubt the worst PvP in the series with magic/weapon art spam builds and 1 shot bleed loadouts. You can only invade players with co-op partners meaning 90% of your invasions are just weapon art gank squads. ""Just use leaden hardtear bro!""- Backstabbing barely ever registers, to the point where even PvE mobs can walk out of it.- Kicking is relegated to a weapon art meaning you're wasting your weapon art slot if you want to kick.- Replaying to create specific builds will be an absolute nightmare due to the random nature of where items are placed, on top of the repetition and scale of the game's content. Have the wiki open at all times. - Summoned players get disconnected after 5 minutes if you can even summon them in the first place without getting an error leaving you stuck with a boss with double hp.All of this is if you can get the game to launch, don't get the invis enemy bug and consider stuttering sub 60fps playable.Really feels like they ran out of time on this one, but what's new lol. Gz if you enjoy this game's end-game.",0
Negative,"Wow, so many paid reviews. But no money for dubbing? Ok, but the game doesn't run very well either. If you stand still, you can move your camera at 60 fps. Great. But as you walk through the world, the frames drop at chunk load. Also on battle starts and in fight. For a game that is playing at the limits of fairness anyway, a stable performance is needed. It sucks when dying on frame drops and stuttering. My hardware is not the issue. From Software has obviously no experience with open world. But a good publisher who spents tons of money in marketing and reviews. I'm also annoyed about the missing German voices. And oh, the controls and UI are also confusing. But anyway. I can't understand the positive reviews. Ok on steam you can either vote yes or no. But it's not worth a 10 on Metacritic. Even not 0. I'm not just a rage voter or hater. It's just annoying because these issues (i.a. performance) are something the devs/testers are aware of prior to release. But yeah, management don't care/know. Anyway. Thats my first game from this developer studio. I'm not just a fan who gives it a good rating on principle. I'm objective reviewer. Sorry, maybe in a few weeks / month? Just complete and polish the game and tell me when it's ready. What's going on for games nowadays.Update: To the game itself: I cannot understand the positive reviews. It's just boring and just not fair in detail. What's wrong with the DS fans? Ok it's fun to be challenged. . Anyway, nothing for me. I don't like trial and error. And no traps. And no overpowered enemies. And in Elden Ring you have no idea what you have to do. Ok, discovering the world is fun. But you have no plan, no story, Not really. No goal. Maybe you need no goal. . Idk. I don't like the game. The performance issues may affect this experience. Stuttering everywhere. It just feels obsolete. The engine is not suitable for open world. Or the devs are just not good enough.Don't play this game. It's not a must-play game.",0
Negative,"A connection error occurred. Returning to your world.100% completion summary in the comments bellow.I finished the game on Steam and PS5 before reviewing.I'm done waiting for fixes that won't come. Multiplayer is effed. Unless you play with seamless co-op mod most of your multiplayer sessions will end with a connection error related to DRM/Anti-Cheat.This is not an issue in PS5 version, so Fromsoft shows how much they like their PC audience.Game itself is uneven in quality. Many enemies, bosses and rooms are reused many times over or brought back from Souls games, so the world is just desceptively large and many things feel like boring filler.There is no doubt that Elden Ring is a fantastic game and the magnitude of what was achieved here is impressive at the very least, but this game is much less than the sum of it's parts.Recommended if you like Souls games, especially if you loved Dark Souls 3, and you have a PC that largely exceeds recommended requirements.Not recommended if you only meet minimum requirements or if you've never played a Souls game before. Dark Souls 1 (PC), Bloodborne (PS4) and Demon's Souls (PS5) are all better places to start with.Due to bad consumer practice of including DRM that interferes with online play I will keep my review at not recommended until it gets resolved, which means forever.Take Dark Souls 3, put it in an open world - that's Elden Ring. I don't wanna waste characters on describing it, the series is popular enough that it shouldn't be needed. The few new features it adds like spirit ashes, weapon arts and dual wielding (all being in previous games in some form) don't warrant spending time to explain them.+ PlaytimeYou can easily spend 80+ hours on your first playthrough.+ Lots of freedomBoth in exploration and in building your character. There's a lot of ways you can make yourself overpowered, but there are also many non-optimized ways of playing that work.+ WorldbuildingIf you dive deep into the lore there's a lot to like here. Area design is also very strong.+ GraphicsNot top-notch quality, but both design and effects are nice to look at, especially on a 4K TV with HDR enabled. If you have a PC to carry such weight try it.- UnevenA lot of the world is filler. Caves, dungeons or catacombs will feel same. Some rooms are straight-up reused in different dungeons. Bosses are, likewise, reused. Some many times over.Also many animations and models were in previous games. Asylum demons, Bloodborne's shadow-slendermen, hooded imps from Dark Souls 3 and many basic weapons the list of reused assets is large.- ReplayabilityIt's a large game with a lot of filler content, so replaying through it doesn't hold up well. This is the first souls game that I feel is worse on subsequent playthroughs.- Mechanical chariotsTo explain further would be spoilers, but they are badly implemented, unfun and reused too much.- Input reading enemiesMost noticeable if you play ranged. Many enemies will read your input and dodge your projectiles. There are special kind of spells that let you attack despite this, so I'll let this slide.What I won't let slide is how some enemies read inputs for estus healing or even melee attacks to instantly punish you for using them. A boss will finish an attack string, but if you try to do something he will make additional attacks 'sometimes'. You can't really punish those attack strings because of the threat of additional moves, so you have to wait for other, punishable strings. The only skill this tests is memory and patience to not do anything. Fast-paced, quick-thinking reactive gameplay is discouraged, but on the other hand the game is a lot faster than original Dark Souls, so it feels wrong to play.- Some bossesSome are just boring. More like elite eniemies promoted to a boss version with an HP bar. Almost every catacomb/cave/etc. has one of these instead of a properly designed boss fight.But there are at least 2 bosses that simply do not belong in this game. After DS3, Gael was largely accepted to be the hardest-but-fair boss design. Sekiro trumped that with Sword Saint, who was more difficult and even better designed, but only worked because of Sekiro's innate mechanics that made you play a certain way. Sword Saint wouldn't work in Dark Souls 3 and Gael wouldn't work in Sekiro.With Elden Ring it's clear that Fromsoft doesn't try to make good boss fights anymore - they simply try to make them harder and put bosses that don't fit game's mechanics into the game.- CommunityAlways a problem in any game viewed to be ""hardcore"" the community's most vocal population are complete pricks.And also double-standard twats. They will scream at anyone who wants to play co-op without invasions to ""get good"", but at the same time they will cry like little babies if someone has a kill-squad waiting for them to invade. ""Gankers ruin multiplayer!"" - cry me a river, you obnoxious asshats - you created the problem to begin with.Or if someone suggests that maybe bleed is highly overpowered and deserves a proper hard-nerf they don't want that because then they would actually have to play the game.Oh, and online messages are being used for memes and completely destroy the atmosphere of the game.- Anti cheatIt's effectivenes has been proven to be 0 for what it's supposed to prevent, while it makes it impossible to play with simple mods like texture replacements online. Also, it's been proven that additional DRM has influence on connectivity issues.- KB+mouse controlsEmulated gamepad inputs. Games like Monster Hunter World have better controls with proper keybinds, shortcuts, etc. Elden Ring doesn't.- MultiplayerFrequent disconnects are a norm, due to DRM/anti-cheat.Seamless co op is currently top mod for Elden Ring. It lets you play entire game without the anti-cheat in a multiplayer session with your friends where all of you will be playing from start to finish together. No disconnects on boss defeat, no co-op-less zones, everybody gets to ride horses the game is fully playable. I tried it and in my 2-player session played for 2 hours we had no disconnects. A mod has more stable multiplayer than the base game, think about that. In normal multiplayer play unless host summons you for a boss your session will most likely end in a connection error.Obviously Fromsoft's fans will happily ignore this just so they can sing praises for their newest toy. Newest Battlefield has unstable multiplayer? OUTRAGE! But Elden Ring? Nah, man, that's fine, move along pls, nothing to see here, you say anything we will break your knees because Elden Ring is perfect, 10/10.- Biggest slogsLike DS2 Elden Ring likes long gauntlets filled with tough and dangerous enemies without a checkpoint.- CameraYou are forced to unlock camera for almost every big boss. Camera does not do a good job showing you the enemy and what it's doing. It's the worst it's been so far in the series.I lost my patience with Fromsoftware. We are giving sht to other companies for things that community deems acceptable in From's games.Don't believe 10/10 scores - they ignore any and all problems of this game because of the fear of backlash from Fromsoft fans. Or they are made by fans themselves who just gobble anything up without thinking.Elden Ring is a good game, but far from a masterpiece.Hence, I'd give Elden Ring anIt's large size is coupled with uneven quality that is especially noticeable on 2nd playthrough. Plus all PC-related problems. It's a good Soulsborne game, but not the best by any means.Until connectivity problems are resolved (by dropping additional DRM) I will keep the review as not recommended.",0
Negative,"Worst souls-like released by fromsoft so farOpen world in this game is boring af, there is no sense of exploration. It feels empty and it's filled with pointless activities and same assets. Exploration in this game comes down to finding:- random crafting items- groups of mobs that reward you with crappy crafting items- 2 types of dungeons that are always the same, it's either same looking catacombs where you use a lever and open boss area, or caves with upgrade materials and a boss. Bosses in this dungeons are worse designed than in DS2, most of them you can stagger to death by spamming same attack. They stand no challenge and on top of that they are copy pasted so many times that it's ridiculous. Not only they are boring, they also give no reason to fight them, you get so few runes out of them that it's not enough to level up even a single time, farming mobs is more rewarding than this, because you can actually level up and it takes shorter. Exploring these caves is just a chore to upgrade your weapon, unless you like fighting a cat statue, then a cat statue with 2 heads, then 2 cat statues at the same time, then a cat statue but a different color. (basically it's bloodborne chalice dungeons with more copy-pasting, but in bb people hated them, here they are fine apparently.)- world bosses which are copy pasted more than dungeon bosses, i met atleast 10 same looking dragons, 5 erdtree avatars, 3 tree sentinels, 3 tibia mariners and more. All of them you can fight using a horse, and horse combat is dogshit on so many levels. This fights come down to running at the boss, hitting it once and running away, they are not challenging at all and can last so long, that after you fight this bosses couple of times you just skip them out of boredom.- locations with copy pasted assets that don't feel interesting at all, and again provide you with nothing but pointless crafting items. Sometimes you will get an actual weapon but this areas are just too mundane. There are some nicer locations such as castles and villages that are actually fun to explore for the first time, but they look all the same and feel unrewarding. The only exceptions are this bigger locations like Stormveil, academy and Leyndell but there is so few of them it's disappointing.Open world is garbage and there is another problem with it. It doesn't fit souls-like narration. You have no feeling of progression in this world, it's too confusing and gives barely any hints on what are you supposed to do. In dark souls series you could always feel that you are progressing, each bonfire was an accomplishment and despite your goal being unknown, you had obvious paths to follow. Here it's all meaningless, bonfires are on every step and you have no clue whether area you have done, progressed you in any way, often times I felt stuck not knowing where to go next. I understand why you are not being told anything about your path, but in such an open world it brings too much unnecessary confusion and lack of progression feeling.Bosses in this game don't feel right, besides this rushed dungeon and world bosses, you actually meet some of them that challenge you in any way, but they are badly designed. Main problem about them is lack of openings where you can attack them, the bosses just keep comboing infinitely and when they are finally done, they start another combo 1 second later. It might not be as problematic with a fast weapon, though I tend to play with UGS and I felt like I was forced to baiting 2/10 particular attacks. It seems like they wanted to artificially make the fights more dynamic, but it turned out to be a complete mess. The funniest part is that they managed to do it properly before (look at bloodborne/sekiro). Another problem I have with these bosses is the amount of WoW-like aoe attacks and all the sequences which require you to just run for 30 seconds straight because the boss is casting some bs spell. I want to fight with the bosses, not run from them! And that's also funny that they tried to make elden ring faster-paced than dark souls and at the same time they put so many of these stupid attacks that force you to run around and just stare at the boss.After replaying the game a few times I would also want to point out again how dumb the open world is. You don't really have a ""proper"" progression path and what I mean by that is that because of the open world you will either progress too fast or too slow. If you try to run through the game like in previous souls, you won't get enough level ups and you will just get one shot by everything late game (which didn't really happen before). Or you will fight every trash boss on the way and be completely overleveled for the main bosses. Whichever option you pick, it's going to kill the fun. On top of that when you are playing the game for the n-th time and you are no longer charmed by the artificial exploration aspect, open world really becomes a chore. Because every time you replay the game you have to spend at least 1-2 hours, running on your horse with wiki open to collect all the items that you need for your build and materials to upgrade your weapon to +25. Previous games were much more replayable for me because all the listed things happened naturally. You picked up materials/items for your build on the go and by just running through the game you were only a little bit behind with levels because main bosses gave enough souls to make rest of the game feel fair and difficult.For me it's 6/10 because of it's:+ unique art style+ fluid souls-like combat+ amazing scenery + a few dark souls like, engaging locations+ interesting looking enemies/bosses (unfortunately copy pasted too often)- confusing and meaningless open world- badly designed bosses- a lot of copy pasting - optimization- forced crafting system- lack of feeling of progression- not rewarding explorationIt's a mediocre game that I wouldn't play if it wasn't souls-like, besides performance problems it is playable, looks good, but lacks a lot of depth to it and reminds too much of ubisoft open-worldish games.",0
Negative,"The game is great, but I give it a negative cause it runs like crap on PC.If it ever get's fixed, I'll come back and change the review.Update: doubling down on this as I am now having to reinstall the game because it no longer starts properly.",0
Negative,"TL;DR : Wait for performance fix and more QOL fixes. Play if u are fan of souls like game, doesn't mind the 60fps cap and stutters or you just use a controller to play the game.Basically souls like game just that runs like shit even with a 10700K and a RTX3080. Constantly dipping below 60fps cap. Seriously. 60 FPS CAP in 2022? God awful controls, default on screen button scheme is XBOX. You can change it in settings.Character creation sucks ass because moving one slider will move other parts of the slider.KBM menu controls are a mess imo. Game play is what you expect of a souls / bloodborne game. Its all about memorising attack patterns, timing your attacks, remembering the delay between each character movement etc. Parry mechanics is a mixed bag. Just a tip, parrying here doesn't instantly make you attack an enemy back but you have to ready your arms and then strike back. It ain't instant.If you are looking for a fast paced action RPG, look elsewhere. This aint DMC, Warriors, Dragon Age, Assassins creed titles.Also, seriously fucking done with these '10/10' reviews. Full of shit. A game with 60fps cap on PC or runs poorly doesn't deserve a 10/10 treatment.",0
Negative,"Wait to buy once all of the issues are fixed. I'm rolling with a 3090 Kingpin and a AMD 5950X and this game still has horrible stability issues at launch. That's basically the top end of consumer level PC gear in early 2022, but this game is so poorly optimized that not even an over the top setup can enjoy this game. It's also absurd that the game is locked to 60FPS, and has no ultrawide support. It's 2022 FromSoft, get it together!Sadly, this has forced me to have to buy the PS5 version of the game where things run issue free. I hope to one-day revisit it on PC. But this game has ensured I'll never pre-purchase a FromSoft game, ever ever again.",0

Negative,"The game is very punishing with clunky mechanics that make it incredibly frustrating. The target lock system is terrible, especially when it switches targets mid fight because of your camera angle. This is my first FromSoftware game and for a company so critically lauded, I had expected more from a gameplay mechanics angle considering this isn't an mmo. I get that the developers want the game to be difficult and I'll be doing my best to increase my skill, but that shouldn't be an excuse for poorly developed gameplay. Highly overrated title.",0
Negative,"UNPLAYABLE LEVELS OF STUTTERING-I was really looking forward to this, have never been a huge Soul's Like fan gameplay wise, but love the lore and worlds. Figured I would give this a try since it reminded me so much of Breath of The Wild in terms of freedom and exploration. But sadly, as it seems a good 40%+ of players are saying, the game seems incapable of running well on PC. The game already doesn't have cutting edge beautiful graphics (the art direction is beautiful, don't get me wrong) but it somewhat reminding me of an early PS4 game, not very ""next gen"". So having to turn all of the settings down to ""potato"" mode was heart breaking. and that still did not make the game run literally any better. From what I could play the game is amazing, I still have a deep desire to try and boot it up and push farther trough the terrible stuttering, freezing, and FPS drops, which should tell you that beneath all of this there is a gem of a great game. Something is clearly wrong though, I can actively recreate stutter events, and they almost always exclusively happen around bosses or enemies, or when exploring the world on your mount. Your first boss encounter, the Tree Sentinel, is nearly unbeatable, for each time you dodge or the enemy swings or attacks, your game will stutter and you will die, over and over again. In a game where reaction times matter, having the bosses attacks freeze your game for a solid second (that is not an exaggeration) makes it nearly unplayable. You may be lucky and find yourself not to have these issues, but if you are not so lucky then I warn you that this game will anger you very badly when you die for the 15th time to a boss you could otherwise defeat, because of the stuttering. In some cases it is so bad that even a large crab swinging its claw caused a momentary stutter, and when it unfroze it quickly slammed 3 times, then teleported in a fraction of a second, as though it continued to attack me while time was paused and i could not react, and all of the attacks happened at once when it unfroze. And that is just a standard large enemy, not even a boss. You will want to keep playing, but you will be unable too, and that feeling is awful. So until they find a way to patch and fix this issue, I do not RECOMMEND THIS GAME. Hopefully it gets fixed soon, and if it does I will change my review.",0
Negative,"So many re-used assets, ranging from buildings, rooms, models, mobs and even bosses. At first the openworld feels grand and beatiful up until you discover it's empty and filled with pointless ruins and camps that have nothing to them other then the same few mobs or bosses like dragons or erdtree avatars. Only the legacy dungeons, those being places such as Stormveil castle, Raya Lucaria accademy ecc, are worth exploring, the open world itself isn't. The combat feels exactly the same as previous dark souls, you played any of them and you pretty much experienced Elden rings gameplay. The game's balancing is out of wack, and the damage some enemies do later on in the game is enough to one-shot or two-shot you even while on a tank build, and the combos and attacks that some bosses do can last upwards of 20 seconds and at times even be unavoidable, forcing you to be defensive until your turn to attack is up. The lore and the ""story"" are delevired through the same boring and uninteresting method that from software keeps using, that method being reading hundreds of vaguely written item descriptions, as a result even though GRR Martin has helped in making the world, you really don't feel any of his influences when playing. The multiplayer, the pvp especially, is broken. Both in a literal and balancing sense. Constant disconnections, hosts and enemy players turning either invisible or temporarly invincible, broken bleed build that can one shot you, spells, weapon arts and incatations that can stun lock you until you die or turn you straight up immortal like with bloodhound step . Poor design choices when it comes to multiplayer itself can be found everywhere, no rewards for PVP such as the covenants in previous dark souls, no more fight clubs, no more invasion areas like pontiff sulyvahn in DS3, no more mutiple summoning at the same time, forcing you to wait 3 minutes per summon, constant and omnipresents ganks, which are made even worse thanks to the password system that removes all the matchmaking restrictions normally present in summoning, allowing the host to summon in friends that can be level 700 with a fully upgraded +25 weapon even while you as the invader are lvl 40 with a +10 sword. In general no fun or creativity can be found in elden ring's pvp.All in all if you want a Dark Souls 3.5 with a pretty yet empty and boring world, filled with re-used assets with no thought or testing placed into balancing anything then go right ahead play this game.",0
Negative,"Currently the game is unplayable with all of the stutters. Playing at 1080P on Low settings with a Ryzen 7 5800x and RTX 3070, and it has some many stutters and freezes that it gives me a headache when I try and play it. Dying is easy enough as it is, when my game stutters every time an enemy swings at me, it makes it impossible to play. Please fix this issue so I can play this game.",0
Negative,"Do I love this game? Yes. Do I recommend it to others? ONLY IF YOU WISH TO PLAY SOLO! Do NOT play with friends. There are abusers and metagamers who specifically target new players, with even a known cheat allowing them to invade players SOLO. So play Solo Offline if you REALLY want to enjoy Elden Ring without frustrating cheaters and abusers.In terms of performance, the constant stuttering my friends and I experience is infuriating. I've died countless times dying when the game stutters, and just about everyone in my group who plays this also Stutters. Perhaps its not everyone, but its bad and common enough that I give major warnings to anyone who picks this up that you WILL stutter.Runs poorly at times, even crashes, it doesn't stop there. Terrible servers on top of it all when it comes to using Co-op. When you have over 20MB/ps download speed and your friend over 50 and still get CONSTANT DISCONNECTS and frustration, it makes Nintendo Servers look like PREMIUM. Fromsoft, please, fix your terrible mistakes so you can make this game FLOURISH.",0
Negative,"The PC port is abysmal. I recently built my PC using a 4090 GPU and an Intel Core I9-14900K CPU and I'm met with constant stutters during fights right when the boss attacks. In some rare instances, the game stutters for around 2 seconds, then I lose the ability to control my character as i watch them go in circles until either I die or reset the game even though my controller isn't disconnected. The problem persist regardless of my graphic settings, whether I'm playing on High or Low and I saw online that this was a constant issue after purchasing. I wanted to see if something similar happens in other games like Monster Hunter World, and it ran smoothly on Max settings. In my own opinion, I also didn't find many bosses fun to fight. I know souls games are built around dying and learning for next time, but this one felt especially malicious. I played a Dex/Faith build and didn't want to use summons because I was interested in learning the Boss patterns only to find many boring. Many of the bosses rarely stagger if at all and so many bosses work off 3 different variations of attacks: one that makes you roll, one that baits and catches rolls, and one that punishes X amount of weak attacks. Going in the first few times means you have to die because the game is so focused on tripping you up with long winded attacks than interesting boss fights. Once I broke the attacks patterns down to this, the game got really boring since every death felt like it only existed to find out what attacks are delayed and nothing else. My learning process coupled with the stuttering before every other attack from the boss made playing this game miserable, because it was difficult to figure out what was a delayed attack or what specific actions I can do in between a boss' animations when the game locks up for 1 second and its a coin flip whether it skips ahead or leaves me where I left off. Luckily, the stutters seemed to end around late game, but that could've been because many late game battles were in enclosed areas.Another issue I have is that many dungeons feel repetitive or scummy. I've explored everything I came across, and I can't count the times an enemy was right behind a door, playing dead or on the ceiling waiting to gang up on me the second I entered. In my opinion it isn't ""hard"" to deal with ambushes, It's just extremely frustrating after seeing in practically every dungeon in similar fashion.at the time of posting this, I just finished base game and will play SotE too. I hope the issue's I have aren't as prevalent and I find more enjoyment there, but right now I wouldn't recommend this game based on my own perspective on the gameplay and the poor optimization on PC.",0

Negative,"Not optimised. Buggy and laggy. Piece of shit port. Getting 25 fps while swinging the sword.And the funny part is that it has no ultrawide support, nothing new for a company like ""FromSoftware"" but guys, it's 2022.",0
Negative,"Don't customize a character, don't set up controls, don't fight anything. Just run until you get to the open world and fight the first boss to see if you get frame drops. If you do, uninstall and request a refund before you clear two hours and have to try and talk to someone at Steam that isn't a robot to get your money back, or as a last resort go through your card's issuer to force a chargeback.Buy it again when they fix it, if you want.",0
Negative,"Note: I refunded the game, but played about 40-50 hours in it, last 5 from which was with trainer. Visuals are just great. The Elden Tree, Castles etc feels great to look and visualy explore. Desings and ideas built in them are unique and is a entertainment itself. Some new mechanics feel good. LVLing on your bonefire, respawning next to the boss fight makes it much less frustrating. It is a Dark Souls. Somehow, for the first 20 hours game gives you that challenge and sweet exploration feeling.well thats it. Open world is not open Why? First of all it is not open. It is the same scheme with locations going one after all, but connected with vast nothing. Locations on the same biom blocked by cliffs so you forced to get to it by the path you forced. Open world is not fun I told you, there is a vast nothing? I wasnt joking. Huge terrains filled with the same enemies from the first biom till the end of the game, no loot, no actual reason to explore. Why? First of all you get too little XP for killing someone, so you forced to run through them on your horse. And even if you try, you get. Nothing. No unique sets, no unique weapons, no nothing. Most of the time you will waste your time on killing huge giant for 2k EXP on the end location, where you need 20-30k+ for your level. That is embarassment. Speaking about enemies you are lucky to get 1-2 unique enemies for each location. Most space is filled with guradians, soldiers and fire mages which you can face on first-second location. And animals. Same rams for ALL GAME. Running in the green fields Limgrave? Rams. Cold snowy rocks of Giants? Rams. Swamps? Rams. Same bosses. as an extention to the previous, you got absolute same bosses through the game: Two same Knights on the horses, Two Cerbers, Two fire lizards and DRAGONS DRAGONS DRAGONS. No, it is not reskin or something. They have same moveset, same visuals, same pattert, they are just THE SAME. 5 black dragons in this game which differs with HP and DMG they deal. Shame. Step back in mechanics. Most boss fights are awful. They either too easy either too frustrating to enjoy. Instant splash attacks dealing damage at 1/2 of arena? Pfffff. Thunder strike throung the wall that one shots you? Pffff. Stupid slow-fast-slow-fast movesets? Pretty common. Auto-aim with those slow attacks? Disgusting. Jumping all across the arena, not only evading your attacks, but stretching the time of your fight without any fun in it. Great. Oh, and most of the time they will one-shot you, so you forced to go for HP. Weapons. Weapon designer needs to be fired. 90% of weapons look like shit, same for armor. And there are too little amount of them. I know, DLCs gonna change that, but now you are facing huge ""open world"" with default armor you get on the start for lke 20-30 hours of the game. You are forced lvl your HP Everyone dels insane amount of damage, that most of the time cant be predicted of dodged without hard trying of remembering all patterns. You can wear heavy set with heavy armor only if you point 40+ points to your weight and GET ONLY 30% OF DAMAGE REDUCTION, while light and medium sets gives you about 20+, with extra 20 points left for you to spare on you HP. Crashes and performance everyone is complaining but that is to be fixed surely. Craft is useless All you get from that is arrows and greases for your weapon. In previous games you needed to buy it, here you need to collect useless flowers, waste your time crafting it and. that's it. No fun Smithing is. Awful. You get 25 levels for common weapons, while having about 9 different stones to firge them WHICH DROPS ONLY on location you needed to be with that weapon level. It is like you want to go to diifferent location with your lvl3 weapon, find there lvl7 stone and just. Cant use that cause you've missed location with lvl3-6 stones, live with that. Not even speaking about amount of them. You've given stones only for 2 weapons to upgrade, rest are sold at the end of the game. Huge step back from Souls everything feels undone, huge fields filled with default enemies that gives you nothing and NO UNIQUE IMAGES FOR TITANITE (smith shards) Convenience is not for this game you forgot to set marker for the trader? RIP go wiki find it again. NPC told you to find *ANYNAME*. Did he tell you where? How? Any hint? RIP go wiki. Insane reuse of DS assets most patterns and movesets are from the previous games. You will see it from the begining, nothing to talk here. Delete Radahn from the game",0
Negative,"To preface this: I have over 330 hours in the game at this point. I have every achievement. I have made it my goal to test every possible build just to see what is shit and what isn't for the express purpose of telling people everything that's good and bad about this game. The bad is what breaks the game in its entirety. [ To start with the good: ] Elden Ring offers plenty of build variety across Faith, Sorcery, Strength, and Dex builds that can be easily formed quite early on the game by knowing where to get them and, due to the non-linear format the game takes in the beginning, you're free to go to these locations. Plenty of replayability across save files with several endings to the game. Hours and hours of gameplay (I've finished four characters and nearly finished another in 330 hours) through the use of the open-world travel, dungeons, and bosses. NPCs that are interesting enough to want to listen to them talk and see just what they want, where they go, and just what they're all about. The combat is fine and what you would expect from a Souls-like game from Fromsoft. The horse combat is a bit janky, but it works. [ Now for the bad, and oh boy is it bad: ] (MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD) The performance. Good. Fucking. God. The performance. there is no defending how awful the game is when it comes to this. Fps drops, stuttering, crashes, constant multiplayer connection drops are all over the place. Expect to see them often and I mean OFTEN. Boring dungeons and reused assets are extremely common after a point. Do you know how many times you have to fight Tree Spirits? I've lost count how many times I've run into those bastards. Hell, the end of the game has *three* of them as minibosses in one, tiny location. I'm sick of them. So, so sick of them. Dungeons themselves are boring and only a few of them offer interesting mechanics. The amount of dungeons that are just ""find lever, pull lever"" with no variance is absurd. After the Capital, the point in the game where you cannot pass through until you've completed quite a lot of the world, just becomes a slog and is clearly rushed with just how lazy the game gets with its content. All the enemies have a gorrillion health and hit like semitrucks and are just reused enemies from other parts of the game. Fire Monks? Reused. Giant birds? Reused. Trolls? Slightly different, but still reused. Storm Hawks? Yep, reused. Zamor? A boss in an evergaol, but now reused in an entire area with a billion damage and far too much health. And the end-game bosses, my god are they the worst.Did you ever think ""man, I sure wish the late game bosses were the most annoying things I could fight. I wish they would constantly deal 30% of my health with a single hit while I'm wearing full Banished Knight at 60 Vigor,"" then I have good news for you!Practically all of them do, including basic enemies!The bosses are so fast and deal so much damage that It's nearly impossible for some builds to have an easy time dealing with them. As an example: I decided to test just how hard the game would be for a character to ONLY use the Greataxe and whatever ranged weapons I find. It was the single hardest run. The Greataxe is slow and short the exact reason why I chose it to begin with so nearly every late game boss can easily avoid my attacks and, better yet, because my weapon is so short and slow, some bosses will be able to hit me with certain attacks that I simply cannot dodge away from due to the recovery time on the Greataxe's attack animation. It sucks just as much as I thought it would and I'm glad I tested it that way to tell people just how awful it was. Bleed. Bleed. Bleed. Bleed. Bleed. Bleed is the single strongest possible thing you can use in the game, aside from things like Comet Azur with no FP consumption. If you want to play the game on easy mode, powerstance the katanas Rivers of Blood and Nagakiba with an Arcane build. You will stomp even the hardest of bosses. The hardest bosses in the game are weak to bleeding. Practically everything is weak to bleeding, hell the PvP meta is weak to bleed. It's so unbalanced, it's crazy. NPC quests are nearly impossible to find without searching every nook-and-cranny at any given moment.NPCs can go to locations you were already at and you won't know they're there. NPCs are completely esoteric in what they want from you and only rarely are you given an idea of where to go or what to do. The game is, in every way, rushed.Just now, there's been patches that have included ""new"" quests which are just continuing the quests they already had that weren't even finished yet. Hell, they even just added a part to another quest line BUT DIDN'T EVEN FINISH IT? Come on, Fromsoft, you're better than this. In conclusion: Don't buy the game until tons of patches and fixes have come out. I will change my review when I see the game in a state it's meant to be in. Don't even hit me with that ""git gud, lmao"" or ""skill issue, lmao."" I beat the game several times with several types of builds without the use of ashes or summons. That ""git gud"" mentality hurts nothing but the community AND the game performance as well. You are actively facilitating Fromsoft to not fix their game.",0
Negative,"could be an amazing game, it's beautiful, the combat is fun and responsive, when it works. and thats the problem, this game runs terribly for me (CPU Ryen 2600, GPU 2070) and I am dying due to frame rate drops and stutters constantly. I have tried running on lowest settings and dropped the resolution to 1080p and it is still unplayable. If it gets a decent performance patch I would likely recommend this game. but in it's current state I cannot",0
Negative,The Good: - Looks goodThe Bad:- No optimization- No wide screen support- Menu buttons does not show for keyboard. I don't know what to press- Easy AntiCheat is a cancer- Seems like no offline modeI'll wait for fix or refund.Not recommending on PC in current state.,0

Negative,"After a promising start entering the open world segment demolishes the performance and makes the whole experience feel like a hungover morning in paradise, maybe passing of time will cure all these issues, but until then it s better to just sleep.",0
Negative,"It might be of interest to get this out of the way:I'm a sh*t player, I eat sh*t for breakfast, and even I could beat it without summoning, crafting, levelling vigor, using spirit ashes, rune arcs, any consumables, shields or ranged weapons. If beating this game made you smug, I humbly request that you get over yourself, because even I could beat it and I'm basically your alcoholic uncle. The difficulty is not the issue with this game.that being said,I really wish Steam Reviews had an ""iunno man"" or ""eh"" option.Remember when you reentered the Smelter Demon room and you were surprised to find the Pursuer in there? Imagine that, but all the time, and far stupider. Imagine if Velstadt was the Pursuer. Imagine Vendrick was also the Pursuer. Imagine Ornstein and Smough were the Capra Demon and the Taurus Demon. Imagine at the end of Ash Lake you were greeted with an Asylum Demon boss fight. Imagine Midir was a purple Ancient Wyvern. Bafflingly, most reviews don't mention repeated content at all. Not only are most of the encounters in Elden Ring recycled, some minibosses in this game are actually previously seen overworld enemies but with a boss health bar; I find it really funny they actually play the boss music when there are four dudes exactly like the one you re fighting, and they re just outside the dungeon door. Every dragon is the same, every tree avatar is the same, every wyrm is the same, every red wolf is the same, every gargoyle, tree spirit, tree sentinel, night rider, misbegotten warrior, watchdog, crucible knight, deathbird once you ve seen one, you ve seen them all, but the game is really careful to only hit you with one of each early on. This game blows its load so early, looking back it seems almost evil. 30 hours in I started realizing every dungeon, mineshaft and set of catacombs would have one of 8 possible bosses, and be pretty much copypasted otherwise. Around 60 hours I basically stopped seeing new enemy models altogether. Seeing enemies which were once new and placed in an environment that made sense this time transplanted into a late-game map for the third time is obviously a huge letdown both in terms of immersion and gameplay. I found it both audacious and insulting that not even story bosses were safe from being recycled (I can think of 6 off the top of my head); some instances had me audibly going no f*cking way.""I can t understate how deflating it is when you find out the giga boss to the secret area you ve been in is a throwback to about 15 hours ago, it s f*cking Milton from Accounting again, this time with a minimally altered moveset (and, if you re lucky, they went through the trouble of modelling jeans over his jorts). Conversely, finding a boss you previously thought was secret and unique recycled in a g*ddamn Walgreens parking lot manages to retroactively ruin some of the few instances of exploring being worthwhile you could recall. Sometimes you ll find they cynically changed a letter or two in its name and flipped its cap backwards in a poor attempt at trying to make another Daniel fight give you the illusion of fighting The Cooler Daniel .My playthrough took 140 hours; this is due to equal parts being a completionist and sucking ass. While shills deflect criticism of the game by copypasting ""git gud"", this game is probably the easiest Fromsoft title by far; it gives you SO many tools to make each fight as easy or as challenging as you want. I struggled with every souls game so far because I try to brute force my way through, and that is entirely my choice. Despite this, some aspects of the game are obviously great. The environments are beautiful, the lore is great despite being cryptic and most quests being really unintuitive (some are almost impossible to complete unless you're really lucky or check the wiki). The weapons and equipment feel great, even if balancing can be a little iffy (some are far too strong and some are completely atrocious). The difficulty is adequate (I m an absolute muppet and I beat it without using most of the tools the game gives you, which shows pretty much anyone who s persistent enough can do it). It does have some annoying bugs such as achievements not showing or some ingame prompts not appearing, and there's a type of dog that can oneshot you if it uses a specific attack that has been knowingly bugged for almost two weeks now, but these minor flaws pale in comparison to the problem of bloat. We ve all seen what memorable games Fromsoft is capable of when delivering a linear, more curated and directed experience, but it feels like they either didn t care enough or were simply out of their depth here. DS1 had around 25 unique bosses with maybe 3 reskins. It also had a much shorter playtime, a better pricetag, a fraction of the budget and it came out over ten years ago, and I feel it worked better as an experience than this game did. None of the Souls games felt like this much of a slog. I was honestly concerned the final boss would be a repeat (and behold, the second-to-last one was). By the end I was exploring out of commitment but praying I didn t find anything, because I knew whatever the game would throw at me I d have done several times before. When the game was done I was just glad it was over.The game will drive you up the wall if there s a single completionist bone in your body. Elden Ring is not a bad game, but it often felt like it was a bad use of my time.",0
Negative,it is 2024 and this game does not have native 21:9 support and drops co-op connections like it's a feature. Bloodborne can do 21:9 but not this game.july 2024 update: playing DLC offline just so i can use the 21:9 ultrawide hack,0
Negative,Love the decision to make the boss fights with the big fuck off bosses turn based combat since you can only have +50fps if the boss is not doing anything and if its using one shot mechanic too bad should have rolled before it was his turn. 10/10 turn based combat game. Real time combat is around 4/10.,0
Negative,"The port is tragic. From Software still has no idea what a computer is and must be utterly confused when they pick up a mouse or keyboard. All the UX conventions of the last 40 years? Don't expect any of those learnings here!The frame rate drops to <10 whenever you bring up a menu. The game has sparse features and naive implementation of things like Vsync and AA. Some things are clickable, which is a start, but so much more is wrong then is right. You have a secondary inventory that ends up being bound with 'E' as a modifier key. Of course you can't bind these things individually.It's a total disaster of a port and while I guess it is technically, kinda functional enough to avoid a refund from me, it certainly doesn't deserve a recommendation.",0
Negative,"Apart from some performance issues like slow downs when riding and facing bosses, what is already pretty bad. The game does not support Ultrawide resolutions in 2022. Can't recommend it.Will update my review when FromSoftware have some shame and fix their game.",0
Negative,"After an hour of research trying to get widescreen working, I've learned that you can get banned for a widescreen fix. Why? I don't understand why one dude by himself can fix it, but the developer can't just implement it into the game. It's sold well over 20 million units. That's 1.2 billion dollars. You make a billion dollars but don't support widescreen, you lock the FPS to 60, the frame time is busted and HDR doesn't work. And they know about all of this. They just shrug their shoulders and choose not to fix any of it. And when one guy fixes all of it for them, they'll ban you for enabling those fixes. There are workarounds for the anti cheat but it's hard to know if it works or not because every time there's an update, it breaks it. So you gotta roll the dice? Cross your fingers? WTF? I realize that most people laugh and say ""dOn'T bUy a WiDeScreEN mOniToR""Why though? I've spent thousands of dollars for a premium experience and they've turned my PC into a console for no reason at all. What's far worse is them saying ""some nice fellow did our job for us and fixed everything, but we'll ban you for using those fixes.""I refuse to reward this kind of carelessness when they're sitting on their @sses with a BILLION DOLLARS in the bank.",0

Negative,"This DLC is very disappointing. Way overtuned bosses that are designed with either co-op or spirit summons in mind (they're just way, WAY TOO BULLS IT to try to deal with 1v1). I'm saying this as someone who has played and enjoyed FS games since Dark Souls: PtDE. All the new ashes and abilities are very cool and anime but of course completely broken and unbalanced in PvP. No changes to horrible P2P connections on PC were made. Finally, the game just doesn't run that well and occasionally crashes. From, please, I know you can do better.",0
Negative,"Here is my review about this Invade/Disconnect SimI want to play in co-op mode, and not be invaded every 2 secs, during boss battles, with people with high tier stuff! I don't give a crap about oh ""git gud"" There is nothing to get good about on that aspect with griefing players with high tiered weapons, one hitting low level players. Boss almost dead, invaded from high tier player, both players dead. Don't even get me started on The multiplayer disconnection issues.",0
Negative,"I have played this game for well over 55 hours and honestly thought I'd be leaving a positive review when I got around to it, but recent events have made that impossible. Unfortunately, as it is right now, I cannot recommend Elden Ring to anyone, or at least anyone who intends to play online. That is a strong detractor for me personally as the community at large is a main reason why I love the souls-borne-ring series so much. Invading, being summoned to help others, and exploring together is the best part of this game which is why I have to say I can't recommend it.After 55 hours I finally convinced a friend of mine to try it out and I was very excited about the prospect of playing and adventuring through the world together. Not even 5 minutes after he managed to summon me did we get invaded by someone with the name Malcolm Reynolds. Likely not the actual infamous hacker and far more likely just a kid who knew how to use cheat engine, but all the same we were summarily both trapped with our respawn points set to instant death. Immediately after, my friend very rightfully refunded the game with intent of keeping his distance until an actual form of anti-cheat has been implemented.This should not be as big of an issue as it is, and I know this for a fact as someone who put over 2k hours in Dark Souls 3. That games hackers were more forgiveable as it was an aging game and From Software had no real push to take strong action against them with their newer games taking priority. This left the defense of players up to the modding community who eventually created the Blue Sentinals and Watchdog mods as a form of player-side anti-cheat. Elden Ring has no such excuses for such oversight being the newest game From Software has put forward.(tl,dr: Game has a laughable anti-cheat system which hackers are exploiting to ruin the online experience for other players. Do NOT buy until From Software takes responsibility and implements proper anti-cheat.)(Also, thank the gods I decided to make a new character to play with my friend and my 55+ hours of gametime wasn't summarily stolen from me.)",0
Negative,"I set this review to negative because this is a dumb port. It's been 2 years since launch and yet you can't unlock the frames without mods (at the very least you can have the game's hz set to your monitor's if you put it in borderless window, only should worry if you got a monitor doing more than 60hz though) [also check your display settings and look at what hz settings you are using on your monitor, for some reason windows defaults to 60 instead of the highest refresh rate], and there's only support for 16:9, no other ratio. It is absolutely unacceptable to spend 60 euros on a game from 2022 only to see that you are locked to 60 frames on a game that looks alright, not gorgeous, but alright.Aside from that, this game is good. The gameplay is good, but I've had moments where it was plain bullshit and getting hit for no reason when I clearly dodged the attack. There are different classes in the game, mage, archer, berserk (I believe is the name?) which split into subcategories, though I don't know how effective archer is. It gives a lot of choices in play style and allows you to differentiate from other players builds. It's probably got the most diverse playstyles in a game I have ever played, which is good, for player's who've been playing for a long time, and bad for new players if you don't introduce them properly to multiple playstyles.OH WAIT, I forgot to mention, if you are using Kb&M, you might as well refund the game, yeah did I mention it's a shitty PC port? The only way to comfortably play the game is by using any controller. Rebinding keys is an absolute torture and in order to leave the keykind menu you can't press ESC to leave it, no, but guess what? Your controller can leave the menu no problem. Oh you want to leave the menu made for binding your keyboard? Guess fucking what, either use a controller to leave or ALT+F4 and re-enter the game. How do you mess up that badly?If the game wasn't such a bad PC port or wasn't on PC at all, it would have definitely deserved GOTY. But it is on PC. And even after 2 years since release and now with the DLC also being released, it is still in this shit state.",0
Negative,"Can't even bother to correctly initialize the D3D12 pipeline cache library for shader caching.This port is garbage, we can hope that FROM patches it over time.

These problems should have been foreseen and managed better, rather than consumers having to pay and wait for patch pushes in order to access the online functions. I will not be adjusting my review.

Negative,"Yes I recommend this game, but already 6 months after release and there are still a lot of optimization problems, I'm starting to think that they will never be solved, worse is that optimization problems usually appear during difficult fights, which is very frustrating!",0
Negative,"This is a tough one, because at its core Elden Ring is something of an achievement. It will doubtless set a new threshold for quality in many aspects of the open world genre. Ironically, I don't think I'd be as harsh on the game if it hadn't reached so high and almost made it. Unfortunately, at the end of a nearly hundred hour play through, at that most important point in a game's story and pacing, I found myself disinterested and dissatisfied. And this was a feeling that had been building up throughout the last third or more of the game.Because the experience of playing a game takes place through a series of sequential events, we're never able to get a proper bird's eye view of a game before we play it (or before we spoil ourselves by watching an in-depth review). And for this reason if you play Elden Ring for maybe just 30 or 40 hours, or if you b-line through the major bosses in the game, you may think ""wow, this is awesome"" because it is. But if you try and really explore the incredible world they've created for you, and if you play to the end of the game, the cracks will begin to show. Epic boss fights that may have provided a great experience for you early on are casually copy/pasted into boring template style side dungeons. Many of these duplicated boss fights are even required for you to progress in certain quest lines, and in some cases the number of times you might end up fighting the same boss numbers as high as 8 or 9. And perhaps worst of all, most exploration and side content fulfillment awards you with a unique item that is worthless to your build. Allow me to explain. There is a huge amount of build variety in the game which is one of its strengths, but because you, for instance, decide to play unga-bunga two handed warrior style, any talisman, weapon, armor, spell, or summon that benefits or synergizes with a caster build is now worthless to you. And it doesn't stop there, I can confidently say that the vast majority of the above mentioned items I found I never used (even most melee weapons) because there was no reason to outside of wanting to try a different build. The other reason the bad rewards is a problem is because incidental EXP gains from killing mobs while exploring new areas is practically worthless. The reason exploring dungeons and whatnot in Skyrim is worthwhile is because you're always leveling up your skills through combat, so even if you don't get an especially useful item at the end, you don't feel like your time was wasted. In Elden Ring, there's no such fallback in place. The only saving grace comes with the very first play through, and that is the joy of exploration. Once that's done, sadly, there's no reason to ever do that content again unless you know you're running a build that uses whatever is at the end. This effectively eliminates the reason to do the vast majority of catacombs, gaols, side exploration, etc. When I play a single player RPG that I really love, one of two things (or both) invariably occurs. I either delay finishing the game, so that I can do all the side content possible or I finish the game and immediately start another playthrough. In Elden Ring I started avoiding most side content (catacombs especially) about halfway through. And when I got to the final boss, I gave it a couple of attempts and said 'fuck it'. The final boss fight is awful and a really regrettable way to end the game. It is the worst boss fight in the entire game in my opinion, and it didn't help that I just didn't care enough to finish it at that point. I know some people will love this game, and that's great. I certainly had my moments while playing. I just wish they had landed a little closer to their intended destination when they began this ambitious project. As Margit the Fell Omen says when he kills your newbie ass for the tenth time: 'Put these foolish ambitions to rest.'",0

Negative,"The game is no doubt a great game with a lot of time put into it, but the issues that are prevalent make it a terrible experience. First, the PC optimization is terrible. You quite literally have to restart your pc because your game won't stop stuttering (sometimes that doesn't even help). Second, health/artificial difficulty is a major problem. I should not have to level vigor (health) to 40-50 (hard cap of the stat) just to survive attacks and even then at the endgame you will still get one or two shot borderline forcing you to finish boss fights without making any mistakes. With the game already barely giving you runes to level up this is terrible design and no other souls game has had this issue before. Third, a majority of the bosses and dungeons are lazy copy and pastes following the same issue dark souls 2 had. My first playthrough without summons was misery and not an enjoyable experience because of all these reasons. If you want to play a perfect souls game go play dark souls 3. :D",0
Negative,"This one hurts.I want to like this game. I really REALLY want to like this game. But I don't. Why?Becuase the first 1/2-2/3 of this game is good! Very fun, lots of enemy variety and exploring every nook and cranny is a fun and rewarding experience! The bosses for the most part were a great time to smash my head against.And then i got to the Atlus plains and the game became a boring irritating slog. Almost instantly too. The bosses become repeats of bosses you've already seen, the basic enemies are the exact same as the enemies that you've seen for the last 4 areas, just tankier and hit harder. The game feels like they front loaded it with all of the exciting content then desperately had to fill in the rest of the game with copy and pasted content. It managed to retroactively dislike previous boss fights by having the exact same boss show up again, and im not talking about some random enemy demon or tree, im talking about storied named bosses that you beat and then they just randomly show up again. There are roughly 10 bosses that you have to fight only once. Out of 170.It is honestly one of the most frustrating games i've played in where the first 2/3 are really really fun and then you run into a steel wall of disappointment and frustration.Honestly is worse than Dark souls 1 and 3.",0

Negative,"This is a review from an experienced player of the souls series, my overall opinion of the game is that it's the worst game in the souls series but it's still a good game overall. The reason I've chosen to go for a negative review is that whilst my opinion may be mostly neutral, it's definitely negatively leaning and I am able to think of many more cons than pros. If you're a more casual player, half of the cons I list here probably won't bother you.Let's start off with cons:I'll get this out of the way at the beginning, this game has been catered to a more casual audience, I found all of the bosses to be pretty easy compared to the other titles in the souls series.The telltale motion is completely unintuitive. What do I mean by this? If you've ever played a game like this whether it be a souls-like or just generally a game where you have to dodge, you'll know what a telltale motion is. If you're good at games like this, you will be intuitively able to beat bosses easily by responding to the telltale motion. In this game, bosses are intentionally designed with unique and incredibly irregular telltale motions that are impossible to guess without losing to every boss a couple of times just to learn the telltale motions. An example of this is Margit, who winds up his swing for a seemingly random amount of time and then swings, this is a timing you cannot guess and have to memorise to beat, it's not hard to beat once you've memorised it, but it's not fun game-play.The reason this has been done is whilst all the bosses have a relatively easy move-set, you can't just instantly sweep it and as such, casuals will come across a boss, get crushed by it, and then beat it in just a few more attempts and get that instant ""woo hoo"" feeling they get when they think they've improved. You'll find that even the worst players will beat bosses in a couple attempts and there will be little discrepancy between them and the best of the best, pleasing the casual audience, this has been done intentionally by HARD gimping the telltale motion.EDIT: This review was made at launch and this paragraph detailed the incredibly horrible weapon balancing, to my knowledge this has been fixed to a reasonable extent and as such I've removed this paragraph.One of my personal key issues with this game is that previous souls games reward you for exploring. On the other hand, this game PUNISHES you for NOT exploring. I do not like the lack of freedom I have with my play-style and an example of this is listed below:There are 9 weapon upgrade tiers unlike the standard dark souls 4 tiers. This means that upgrade materials for each tier are spread incredibly thinly and therefore each slice of the game for each upgrade material is also significantly smaller, making it much harder to narrow down where each material would be. Not only that, but because there are SO many tiers, it's much more likely for you to miss a material for at least one of the tier and end up progressing far enough for the earlier tiered materials to no longer be around. E.g. I discovered the ember to upgrade my weapon to +15 when I still had a +3 Great Epee because I had not discovered any of the previous embers to upgrade my weapon beyond that; I had to look up a guide to find those previous embers because they are hidden in seemingly random parts of the map and I could not progress without doing so because I was literally tickling bosses for smidgens of HP.As it ties into one of the previous points, I'll mention that to me, the middle area of the game felt incredibly rushed. I experienced the early and late portions of the game to be great, but when it came to the middle I just wasn't having fun with the bosses or the enemies. In the middle section you'll find that almost every enemy has boss-level HP, boss-level damage and has move-sets vast enough to be equatable to a boss. What this does is encourages you to skip passed enemies which negatively ties in with my point about exploring, meaning you are punished for essentially not taking out re-spawning bosses.I almost forgot to mention the amount of copy+paste jobs there are in the game. You fight the EXACT same bosses, even looking the same, MULTIPLE times at different parts of the game. There is even mix and mash jobs where they put multiple bosses you've already fought together in one arena. I can name at least 2 bosses off the top of my head where there are at least 4 encounters with slightly varying appearance and move-sets. Not to mention the same goes for mini-bosses, you can find many of the same mini-bosses copy+pasted all over the game.Now that's enough of my complaints, onto some pros:Horse combat, this vastly changes the game in the sense that you can fight bosses in two ways, on horseback or on foot. Whilst on foot, you are significantly slower but you can dodge for immunity frames. Whilst on horseback, you cannot dodge for immunity frames but you are however significantly faster, which means if utilised properly in certain boss fights, will make for a much easier time.There is a LOT of content, ranging from dungeons dotted all over the map to roaming enemies and somewhat (?) random encounters as well as a WAY longer storyline than all of the other games. What this means is even if you're going just for a single clear with no intent to replay, you will get your money's worth in time spent on it.The game-play is extremely fluid, not once in the game did I experience a movement that felt off or clunky, everything moves in a way that just seems natural. Alongside that, the game is visually astounding and holds up in terms of modern game standards.There are a lot of secrets to be had which aren't necessary to progressing but also don't directly make you stronger in the game. Like all other souls games, there is at least one secret ending to be had, provided you complete a set of optional actions before progressing to a certain point in the game. This makes for good replayability.TL:DR combat has become more of a memory game but at the same time the game itself has evolved in many numerous ways that change it from a normal souls game.",0
Negative,"The official account told us that there is an Arabic language, but after the release we were surprised by the opposite",0
Negative,Refunded. They did a bad job of the port. No FoV adjustment and I was nauseated playing. By default you have xbox control prompts and you are stuck at 60 FPS as the max. Disappointing.,0
Negative,"Fantastic game ruined by PC port.Amazing game that has been teared into pieces due to Japanese developer's who neglect PC performance and their PC player fan base.Cons on PC: (The game runs much better on consoles). - Cheap & poor PC port that feels rushed. (Typical Japanese devs).- Poor performance due to Directx12.(They haven't cached any shaders).- FPS dips on 2080 ti from 60 into 20-30 fps. (Improved with ""fixes"" like device enumerator disable.)(1920x1080, regardless of settings.)- Keyboard control layout is not default.(Shows XBOX controller layout by default, even when starting with keyboard.)- Easy Anti Cheat performance dips. (You can disable with third party, go google).- No Ultra Widescreen Support.(21:9 & 32:9 RIP Ultra Wide Users).- Poor mouse & keyboard layout.- Unbind-able keyboard keys. (Hard-bound, possible fix with third party?)- Next to no keyboard support/poor button layout. Overall, the PC port is just lacking.The game is fantastic in itself, but the performance issues and lack of resolution support is frustrating. -I wish FromSoftware would put in more effort into their PC ports.Very disappointing for a title to release in this state,especially with such amazing reviews and reputation.I recommend everyone to wait for more patches and read the patch notes,as I'm sure they will have no choice but to improve the performance, or perhaps they won't.",0
Negative,Really wanted to love it,0
Negative,The DLC patch made the game run terribly. It's nearly unplayable.,0
Negative,"Edit: Somehow people are cheating despite the inclusion of EAC. First big patch fixed ONE exploit. You might as well play offline but then you'd be stuck with how completely uninspired this game is. Half of the enemies are ripped directly from Dark Souls 3 and fighting a rat with 2k hp makes it obvious that there was no effort put in. This is embarrassing.I'll consider giving this game a good review if From fixes all of the abusive shit in PvP. This game is basically unplayable online with 9/10 players relying on bugs to two shot you. On top of that, the netcode is still terrible with players constantly disconnecting and the same high latency bullshit that's been plaguing these games for over a decade.Also, the bosses that allow co-op are completely arbitrary meaning that you basically have to look everything up if you don't want to completely fuck a random region of the map for playing with a friend. Enemy balancing and weapon progression make no sense.",0
Negative,"Just lost all of my progress. When loading a character the game gives me some message about naming my character ""_"" and starts me at the beginning of the game. I quit out to the main menu and see that now my main character is gone. I've tried everything from verifying files to hex editing the save files to try to recover my character. Nothing. Searching online shows this just happens sometimes. That's 350 hours on my main character simply gone. Thanks, FromSoftware.A year and a half later I decide to give the game a go again. Black screen on startup and Easy AntiCheat blue screening my whole system. What a fucking joke.",0
Negative,"I'm going to finish this game out of spite but its really not friendly to casual players. Great open world and cool designs but the dungeons are a huuuuge slog and the bosses (while really cool looking) are incredibly tedious to fight and all have a long, long learning curve to not get immediately one-shot literally seconds into the fight. Losing currency and exp on death is more frustrating than not and just eats up time when you have to backtrack and pick it up. Tutorial kind of exists and its better than previous titles but there are many abilities and features that are left unexplained and it's very easy to miss relatively important items early on. And seriously, add in a damn difficulty slider. I don't care if it's ""meant to be hard"", there's a point where the difficulty of the game gets to be unfun and this game gleefully leaps over that line at many points. Don't buy unless you're a masochist.",0
Negative,"I really tried to enjoy Elden Ring, and it's a decent game, but for every single good thing about it there's a bad one. The enjoyment of the game was more of a love/hate relationship. The things that it does well it does extremely well and better than all souls games before it, but the things it does bad it does the absolute worst.The bad things include cheap boss design, such as delayed attacks on almost all bosses, lame copypaste boss design towards the end of the game. But so far, the worst thing is duo bosses. They're not even new ones, just same bosses you fought before, thrown together because ""why not"". Game also has a handful of one-shot kill mechanics which is unlike FromSoftware to do. And that's not even mentioning the performance issues. This PC port isn't acceptable in 2022. To add to that, game is still locked to 60 FPS, it feels like a relic of the past at this point.Elden Ring is the biggest FromSoft game I've played, but it's also the cheapest one.",0
Negative,"I really enjoyed my time with Elden Ring, but due to severe performance/low-optimisation issues, I've decided to refund it. The game was great, but I found myself inexplicably dropping to near-zero FPS, with a setup that well exceeds the recommended hardware.After lots of research, all I found was incredibly unusual methods to resolve the problem: I read that it was tied to absurd factors, like which USBs are connected to my PC, or if I have mouse/keyboard software installed on my computer. Apparently, I'd have to delete a lot of software (not 'End Task,' delete,) and that's simply not worth the hassle. I tried tweaking settings; I even enabled the lowest graphics preset, but the issues prevailed.There's absolutely no reason why I should have to resort to such stupidly illogical practices just to play the game; it's beyond upsetting, as I was really eager to try this.If you're willing to endure the dreadful optimisation, I'd certainly recommend Elden Ring, but I'm going to leave negative review because the problem was so severe.I'd definitely reconsider purchasing if this issue is resolved.",0

Negative,"I kept playing this game because I wanted the ending to make it all worth it. I judge games based on their ratio of time to satisfaction. Elden ring was plenty satisfying for the first dozen or so hours. But in the hundred and eighty - good god - hours that followed, it became more bland with every step.I worked hard to be a completionist on this, because I wanted to be afforded the opportunity to see the most I could of the characters in the game, of whom I'd grown fond. And also because I'm weak-willed; but let's leave that out of it.Upon finding that there was nothing more I could do with all the game's lovely characters - who unfortunately had developed little even up to that point (unless you can call 'that' a development) - I decided to beat the game at last. Maybe I'll finally get to see some stuff happen, I thought, and in a period of time more condensed than just one thing every few hours.No. It's just over. And that's when it struck me - that this was the game. It wasn't destined to get any better. It wasn't building up to anything more than what it let on.This has been a very disappointing evening for me.Now, maybe it's my fault. I didn't use guides. I didn't look things up. I tried to understand the story on my own. And so maybe I missed a lot of opportunities for character development - probably not helped by the fact that I got what I presume was just the normal ending.Well, I refuse to blame myself. I tried very hard to immerse myself in the story and let myself enjoy it, but if there was a good story in there, it isn't accessible by somebody who's trying to find it on their own. Maybe I could replay it now, with the help of guides, and see some of what I missed. And spend dozens more hours slogging through experiences I've already had just so I can lick a few extra crumbs of story off the floor. I'd rather just read up on what I missed!But if I have to look up a plot synopsis to get any satisfaction out of a game I played, then it'd probably have been better to skip the game and read the synopsis in the first place. The story wasn't worth it, the gameplay wasn't worth it, and most of all, the time wasn't worth it. With that in mind, understand this - if the game was shorter, I'd have liked it more. Even if it was the same price. I just want my time to be well spent. I want everybody's time to be well spent.I'm ashamed of myself for being so desperate to finish this game, always with the hope that I'd get enough satisfaction from the ending to make up for the unfathomable amount of my time I've put into reaching it.I didn't.You know, I'll always remember the attack patterns of dragons. And I'll not soon forget the sound of big boss dudes ripping their own limbs off for fun.But I don't think I'll remember much else about my time in Elden Ring. The memories have sunk, you see, and they've sunk deep; deep into the moldering ooze of hundreds of hours of trying to hit things without letting them hit you back.Godspeed, Elden Ring. May something better come of you.",0
Negative,"Game is hard which is to be expected. It's a bit harder because controls suck and it's not always clear from animations when you can hit an enemy or when the enemy will hit you.Also the keyboard controls are some of the worst I've ever seen. It's like they gave the job of assigning keyboard keys to an intern that never saw a computer in their lives. Sometimes you exit menus with Q and other times you use the more sane key, Escape. NO ONE EVER USES Q FOR THIS WHAT THE HELL AND WHY ARE THERE TWO KEYS TO DO THE SAME THING!Also mouse movement is a bit choppy, at least on my setup.The reason why I don't recommend this is because it's frustrating, and not just because it's hard, but because it's hard because of things not related to what should make something hard. It's doubly hard because controls are shit and animations are misleading. Also you have to make some choices in character creation that isn't explained during character creation. I got this stick that more or less was explained as doing some magic crap. It had limited uses and the use button is `X` on Xbox and `R` on the keyboard so I used it up just because I pressed the wrong button over and over.Also if you haven't got a target selected and you hold up the shield and move backwards the charcter will turn around exposing your back to whatever is attacking you.",0

Some areas in the open world are so boring and empty, but you have a few hidden gems in there if you look hard enough. Also, the enemies are just a nuisance in this game, you just end up running past most of them, and there's like 7 billion of them in every zone.

But it's not an excuse for FS to keep going with this attitude, I've paid full price for AAA game and I want to be threated properly.This game lacks of pretty common features which became a coommon practice and have to be mandatory for every game which releases today.This game has bad performance on rigs which exceed recommended requirements, it has a 60 FPS cap but what I don't understand completly is that this game not support ULTRAWIDE monitors and aspect ratios like 21:9 and 32:9. Shit, this game still don't have icons for k&m! And don't feed me this crap about ""Who playing dark souls on k&m?!"" This game releasing on PC so why I have to struggle with UI because I choose the most basic way of playng game on PC? Also do you guys remember Dark souls PtDE and what made it somehow playable? Right it is a famous DS Fix which was mandatory to run this game. Well, now it won't happen because FS implemented EAC in their game, so you can't just download community fixes like ultrawide fix or fps unlocker unless you want to get banned of course.Speaking about community fixes. Elden ring released today and Flaweless Widescreen already made a patch which adding support of ultrawide and unlocking fps which again shows how poorly FS approached this port for PC.Hell, I can make it even by myself just by edditing 2 or 3 values in hex editor. If they can't do it, it's unacceptable but fine I'll do it myself . And then they will ban me the minute I pull this trick off. FS just leaves me no option!FromSoftware are completely out of touch with modern technologies and modern standarts in PC developement and I won't encourage it. If you incapable with implemeting such simple things why you just didn't put it on outsorce to QLOC? At least they didn't have such stupid problems with Dark Souls Remastered.It's a shame that I can't refund my money because I've bought key not in Steam, otherwise I would already asked for refund.I've always thought that the true nature of PC gaming is that you can play games the way you want, you can tweak the graphics as you like, you can choose controller or k&m and you can choose the monitor or aspect ratio, will it be office display 4:3 or will it be super ultrawide monitor 32:9 or 4K 16:9.

Negative,"Really, probably unnecessarily so, high level of entry. But once you get over the hump, it's very fun!Update: 6.5/10, ARPG / Sandbox RPGTLDR: Lacking in the RPG department and lacks direction. Combat and its difficulty are good (in single-player).A lack of direction in a sandbox is usually compensated for with immersive RPG elements - the game has to drive you somehow. Whether that means making it story-driven or relying on other design elements.Hype made the game out to be something it isn't, so I came into Elden Ring expecting a lot more from this ""hardcore open world RPG"" with ""one of the best stories in a game ever,"" ""honestly a masterpiece."" I remember being so excited to play after making my character, only to be incredibly disappointed there was no way to RP them. No way to interact with the world, no way to show their personality; nothing. I didn't feel integrated into the world at all.So I aim to set expectations straight, hopefully saving you some frustration. As among other things, it can feel isolating being, apparently, one of the only people who didn't have fun playing this game.- Don't buy for multiplayer (unless you want to setup mods)- Be careful if you come from an RPG/CRPG background- Has a (potentially long) time till ""click"" moment. (So I am told anyway, I haven't actually reached that point myself. FromSoft games seem to be designed so the pain of early game makes the end feel more meaningful; you appreciate the struggle. Or maybe that's abuse apologist nonsense. All will be revealed in time, I suppose. Regardless, I feel this transition period is getting into wasting my time territory.)And a seemingly small gripe I have is the lack of a journal. How am I supposed to remember the dialog?! This makes the game unplayable for me, but luckily there is a mod for that (ugh). FromSoftware clearly wanted to expand their player base (with open world RPG enjoyers), but failed to expand their game accordingly.On a more positive note, the combat is unique and interesting. Killing and looting is satisfying. Exploring should be. Min-maxing a build is one of my favorite things to do. I could probably spent 500h on my first playthrough alone, combing through every pixel of the map.Obviously, this is all based on my experience so far, which is primarily exploring Limgrave: spanking some bears and realizing it's too easy to soft-lock yourself out of basic *disgrunted noises* game mechanics *increasingly disgrunted noises.*I cannot review the entire game fairly.

Negative,"25% Game, 75% WikiI come across yet another NPC standing in the middle of nowhere. The words that spill from their lips are a chaotic sequence of riddles and nonsense. ""Tarnished, you must decipher the message of the twilight's whispers and gather the echoes of forgotten dreams. Only then can the lantern be rekindled and the darkness set alight,"" they whisper. ""Please, not again,"" I whimper as my tarnished, furled fingers reach for the alt-tab keys on my keyboard. ""It doesn't have to be this way!"" I cry in anguish as I type in the URL of the Elden Ring Wiki for the 40th time today. As I scan the Wiki, my eyes widen in disbelief. In an obscure corner of the map, I must perform a specific emote before a statue. Only then can I rekindle the lantern and banish the eternal darkness. To my dismay, this area is inaccessible, locked behind countless hours of progression. My heart sinks. My dreams of playing a game that doesn't make me alt-tab every ten minutes are torn to shreds like a fragile piece of paper. Even if, by some miracle, I were to stumble upon this quest's solution without the aid of the Wiki, the cruel reality is that I would have long forgotten the cryptic ramblings of the NPC who set me on this path.""Miyazaki!"" I cry out to the heavens, my voice echoing in the void. ""In your infinite wisdom, why have you forsaken us with no journal or quest log? Must we wander these lands forever, lost and confused, our spirits crushed under the weight of your cruel design?"" Suddenly, a dark shadow looms over me, suffocating me in its presence. ""W-who's there?"" I ask, too afraid to turn around. A demonic voice replies from the shadows, ""It is I, Miyazaki. You dare question my design?"" A cold shiver runs down my spine, freezing me in place. I feel sick with dread as I know what comes next.I am transported through a thick yellow fog into an arena. Towering above me is Miyazaki the Malevolent, Consort of FromSoftware. ""No! Not another poorly designed boss!"" I shout. I fight with all my might, utilizing the most engaging combat Elden Ring has to offer. I roll thirteen times and land one jump attack. Just as I think it's my turn to play the game, the boss reenters a drawn-out sequence of attacks, forcing me to repeat the monotonous cycle. Each repetition of this dance sucks the fun out of my body and drains my will to live. I emerge victorious but am neither accomplished nor proud, just bored.",0
Negative,"If you play mouse and keyboard; don't even bother. The game ""tutorials"" only show Xbox keys for people using mouse and keyboard. The game also seems to have an intro that chews up Steam's short refund window. Imagine if this game wasn't part of a well-known series.",0

Negative,- 2022 and Elden Ring is one of the 0.0x % of Games that does not support Wide Screen.- Framerate is locked at 60 FPS and feels awful.- Issues with Device Management: Game chooses a random Input device (maybe the first of all Windows ID s?) which can be your Flight Stick or even your Gaming Keyboard. Only Solution after testing 3h: Disconnecting my Keyboard before starting.This is a 60 Euro -Low-Quality- Console Port. - Do not buy unless half the price.- Do not buy with Widescreen Monitor.- Do not buy with Gaming Keyboard.- Do not buy when you like high FPS from your GFX-Card.,0
Negative,"Right now I'd say it is only a game for fans of Fromsoftware and their ""style"" of gameplay. For everyone else there are imho just better games to have fun. Overall it is a quite pretty game with decent combat mechanics, but that is about it for the good stuff. The UI is just absolutely atrocious and screams ""console port"" every two seconds and is unnecessarily complicated since it does not allow certain functions to be assigned to a more keyboard + mouse friendly gamestyle. The multiplayer aspect is garbage as well. Instead of allowing proper coop multiplayer with a friend for all those players that don't get heaps of enjoyment out of having to learn the movement patterns of bosses for 30 hours, you can ""summon"" a player into your game. You can even set up passwords to keep the ""wrong"" friendly players out of your game. Unfortunately that does not go for the legions of fokking gankers that apparently have nothing better to do than invade new player's games and grief the hell out of them.So right now for the current price and without mod support to mod out all those console design elements I'd stay clear.",0
Negative,"Had to rewrite this review after the time I spent. This isn't a ""no"", but a mixed review. So, here are the issues. 1) The name censor. Just get rid of it, please. 2) The game is incredibly imbalanced when it comes to PVP because they went way over the top when it comes to weapon arts. My focus in dark souls games is mainly PVP, so this is naturally a huge disappointment to me.On top of that, they got rid of DS3's double-hit system where you'd hit someone twice reliably before they can roll, which leaves it up to you to offset your timing for a third hit. It was more technical and skillful. *However*, the jumping attacks feel really good and are satisfying. Unfortunately, that's not as big of an issue as how overpowered some weapons are. I suppose it's possible that the community will have a gentlemen's agreement about weapons that shouldn't be used for PVP, but that would happen in the very distant future if at all. 3) EasyAnticheat has no business being in a Souls game as it will conflict with mods when development is eventually abandoned.4) I hope this one is patched. The ""last played with"" section of Add Friend doesn't contain Elden Ring players like it does with Dark Souls games. So if you're having a good time playing with someone, there's no way to become friends with them.5) Spontaneous connection errors happen kind of a lot despite a connection being stable.-And now the good things.1) The world is massive, and there's a lot to do. I didn't enjoy the world when I first started, but it definitely grew on me and I came to thoroughly enjoy exploring.2) Co-op is a lot of fun. I spend more time helping strangers than I do progressing.3) Invading as (or being invaded by) a recusant is a lot of fun - attacking people during boss fights.4) Even though there's a ridiculous amount of overpowered nonsense in PVP, those weapons are really fun in PVE. 5) A lot of weapons feel good and natural. The Caestus, for instance, feels way better in Elden Ring than it does in DS3.6) I love the Ashes of War system for replacing weapon arts.7) Character creation is pretty good, and it's fun to treat your character cosmetically. 8) The game is very good for masochists like me who do stupid things like kill the very first boss, or rush straight to the basement of the first Stonesword Key area and beat the boss with a base character. Even if you're fantastic at Souls games, you'll find tough things here. Good difficulty.",0
Negative,im just bad,0
Negative,"You can see my playtime. I 100%'d base game and even continued to play beyond that, so why don't I recommend it? The art is beautiful, the bosses look cool, it's a classic dark souls game. The game is just fundamentally flawed. Take dark souls 3, it had very satisfying combat. You dodge a few attacks, then the boss is left open for you to get a few attacks in. In Elden Ring, bosses now have lightning fast animations, even the biggest bosses in the game can zip across your screen so fast you can't register what happened before you died. This isn't a huge problem right? Bosses in sekiro are lightning fast and that game is really fun. oh. but in sekiro you have an instant reliable parry. in elden ring your dodge button has a massive input lag because it needs to check if it's being held to start running. you also need to let go and press it again to dodge while running. So now a boss raises it's sword above it's head, holds it there for 3 seconds, and you dodge right when it starts bringing the sword down!. but oops, you didnt account for the 0.5 second input lag and they one-shot you. or you successfully dodge, and the boss LEAPS away, making you sprint after it, all while it continues to swing at you.That's far from the only issue the game has. The ""open world"" exploration is copy-paste catacombs and other assets, so you fight the same 3 bosses every few hours but sometimes there's 2 or even 3 of them! or you start seeing dungeon bosses naturally in the overworld! you get to choose from tens of spirit ashes, but their AI and stats are so terrible that there's only 2 that are considered good in base game (if you're even willing to use spirit ashes, considering it's a little cheesy messing with the boss AI by making it change aggro off of you). Also build variety. you want to play a weapon because it looks cool and it's super unique? Too bad, 90% of the time the most optimal way to play is to dodge the boss's 8 swing combo and do a single jump attack because that's the only window you're gonna get for a while, there's no fast paced aggro build that lets you chain a huge combo, it's just dodge dodge dodge dodge poke. you think you can block enemy attacks and do counters? Your stamina will be shredded and you'll die if you try to block through these 8 swing boss chains, or you'll just be scarlet rotted and die from tick damage anyways (or malenia will just heal off of comboing your shield). Wanna do magic? Guess what? Bosses read your inputs now, and will dodge your spells. Try fighting godskin apostle from range when every time you cast a spell they dodge. now you aren't fighting a boss, you're just trying to trick the AI into wasting their dodge so you can pelt them with the big attacks. not to mention, glintstone pebble is just the most consistent spell in the game because it had GREAT dps, good FP efficiency, and a small windup, so why even bother upgrading to the cooler looking spells? bosses will close the distance before you're done charging loretta's bow. tired of fire giant? just bleed him with rivers of blood, or use the godskin apostle twinspear r2, it'll shred his HP to nothing in seconds. that's the issue with this game, there's an infinite variety to choose from but it'll be extremely painful if you stick to it through your whole playthrough. it forces you to play optimally and rips the fun out of your hands. I learned that the hard way when I did a glass cannon sorcerer build, got to the final boss and they have an undodgable spell that tracks you for what feels like 15 seconds. I had to respec my stats to wear heavier lore-accurate mage knight armor to feel somewhat content that I didn't break my playthrough rules, but it was so painful having to swap in the first place. a lot of bosses have insane resistances to things too, on top of being extremely difficult, so most of the time you're forced to swap just to counter that specific boss. it's not like the game *tells you* what the boss is resistant to either. when i fought spiritcaller cave godskin duo with a full fire damage strike bleed setup, i was tickling them, and realized they can't be bled after a few fights. swapped off of fire to heavy, didn't help much. you know why? they're resistant to fire and strike. I'm going for a fire monk build, but this boss takes such little damage from my setup that I had to come back days later after finishing most of the game (thank god that fight was optional). what's the point in playing an RPG if they make it nearly impossible to roleplay the thing they put in the game? This wasn't nearly as big of an issue in dark souls 3, a game I have like 1300 hours in playing a huge variety of builds. Elden Ring specifically just really punishes you for not playing the way they intended you to play, ""you're only allowed to have fun however we see fit"". You can hyper-optimize everything in the game and beat the bosses without breaking a sweat, sure, but you can't roleplay a fire monk who beats people with their flaming fists (and used holy incantation buffs because fire wasn't cutting it), or an ultra-powerful mage, but you CAN stunlock malenia with the godskin peeler r2. the balance is just a huge step down from the dark souls series. Sure, say it's a new IP, whatever, if it's a new IP why are half of the weapons and enemies and animations directly copy-pasted from all of their old IPs? Some people get their fun out of completely breaking the game and cheesing the bosses to say they did it, some people want to use all of the items the game offers us to write our own story and enjoy it like any other classic jrpg. sucks that the game only caters to the former. (messmer was kinda fun though ngl)",0
Negative,"It was really fun for the first 50-60 hours. The exploration in Limgrave was great and the whole area was beautiful. Then it starts to get boring.

Negative,"Some people call this game ""hardmode Skyrim,"" which is an overly simplified way of explaining this game. The combat is much harder than Skyrim and uses a great energy system. Magic is finite and does not recharge, allowing for strategic planning for its use. Resources are survival-esq is their availablity. Scaling on this game is rewarding and grinding is both a pain and pleasure. This franchise is its own niche. The graphics are great 9/10. They put TLC into the character and foe models and have optimized the terrain graphics for amazing backdrops and vistas. Up close and personal to terrain it is moderate in detail. Animations and effects are on point for both physical and spellcasting. Soundscape and effect are on point. So why is this still a downvote? Because a AAA game studio and well known franchise (that has been on PC before) should be control compatible with a keyboard and mouse. It is unacceptable that keybindings are not intuitive and the UI is not integrated for PC gaming. Especially considering the sheer number of Steam sales this game has.Update: Game breaking bugs from launch were fixed in the first week. Playable now.",0
Negative,"Game doesnt even want to open on my pc so you shouldnt buy the game here from the getgo BUTi bought it on PS5 and heres my review:Elden ring feels more like it was developed before DS3 in almost every game mechanical aspect.-Every move you make is bit clunky.-Casting tools don't have weapon arts.+Game has alot of cool R2's and follow up R2's are even cooler ie Spears.-BUT you cannot use the follow up R2's from rolling attacks like DS3 (which means you have to commit to an r2 and lock yourself in place)-Kick move is now a weapon art? i cannot understand miyazaki at all.-There's no real new variety to starting classes-You cannot swiftly follow up certain attacks(ie Stance wepon art of straigh sword. You can swiftly queue and L2-R1 into LT-R2)-PVP lifespan will not be as long as DS3 due to invasion limitations.+Weapon arts now has 3 different possible follow ups which adds variety (L2-L2, L2-R1,L2-R2)AKA game as it is now has too many flaws and is not worth the money (especially on pc. you are very likely to have stuttering issues apperantly) So wait for Miyazaki to patch it.

Negative,"I have a ton of hours in this game and the thing I've seen most is ""unable to summon cooperator"". I don't recommend it. The multi-player is garbage at best. Please fix it. Please. Would you like to spend a flask to revive Torrent. too bad! You died because of s-h-i-t-t-y game design. SORRY :( Who thought there should be a menu preventing you from summoning Torrent? It slows down the flow of battle and gets you killed 90% of the time. And what is the point? To save you from accidentally spending a flask you didn't want to? I've never had that happen. But I'd prefer it to dying while trying to f-u-c-k with a menu. Basically if Torrent dies your F-U-C-K-E-D. Was this play tested? Did someone sign off on this? F-u-c-k whoever decided to ship this garbage game design as is.And why the hell do you have to log on in order to close the game? What part of the menu requires online connectivity?

Maybe sign in to online once you've already loaded into the game world. This game is more irritating than fun.Why can you move your character (that you can't see) while in the inventory screen? The D-pad (and only the D-pad) moves inventory selector. But the sticks move your character. The character you can't see. You could walk off a cliff, into an enemy, into a trap, whatever.

Negative,"Probably the most overrated game maybe ever, dont get me wrong the game is ok but it seriously is nothing like what you would expect, in ""ELDEN RING"" it seems they tried to broaden their player base but all this did is make the experience over all worse, what i mean by this is, if you want a fighting game this game is ok, if you want a exploration game this game is ok, if you want a souls like game this game is ok, if you want a RPG this game is ok, and so on but its not ""good"" at any of these categories its only ok, they essentially compromised the quality for a larger player base which kinda sucks, this game is nothing like the other souls games which at first made me excited but i never even finished this game, the other games (atleast dsr and ds3 i never played ds2) i liked enough to either 100% or try to 100%, i 100%'d dsr and tried to 100% ds3 however this game by the end of my hours i had no clue where to even go or what to do, which i get it is some of the fun of the game but this may sound weird, there is too much content, what i mean by this is it will take you hours and hours to completely explore the first area and when you want to actually make progress you will have no clue where to go, most games have a main quest for this reason and i know a lot of people are against quests in these games but i think with open world games theyre kinda needed. now onto the balancing, i dont know what theyve changed since release but i doubt its fixed. certain things are so overpowered to the point it feels like cheating using them and ruins the challenge which makes pvp horrible and the main game less fun since every time youre having trouble on a boss you think ""why dont i go back to . build"" and makes it extremely hard to use everything u have to beat a boss since some of it feels like its unfair, i started with strength then wanted to try magic when i got moonlight greatsword but that was way too broken so i swapped back to strength, it got to the point where if i wasnt pure strength and didnt use mimic tears the game felt like cheating but if i didnt use the super broken weapons the game was super hard, and the bosses. half of them dont even feel like skill and the ones youre meant to fight on horse back suck the horse back combat is horrible, the way the keep moving for a bit after you stop, the way the jump is, the way you can only swing in 2 directions it all makes it horrible to use and un enjoyable, but back to the bosses, like i said half of it feels like its almost luck like with radahn or however u spell it it wasnt super hard but it wasnt fun either the you just summoned everyone and tried to get as much damage as possible, i never even learned his moveset and when he wasnt attacking me it made it even harder to dodge it. overall i wish it was more skill based again as that was the fun, learning the game, learning the bosses moveset, learning the timing but now it feels like theres so little of that its not even fun. my best example for the most fun boss to fight yet still challenging is slave knight gael from ds3, that boss yet pretty hard was still super enjoyable all the way through for me as it didnt feel luck based or anything at all, i could use any weapon i wanted and it would still take the same amount of tries, in elden ring it feels like some bosses certain weapons literally wouldnt work for and the game wants you to change which completely ruins it for me, in dsr and ds3 i probably only swapped weapons like 4 times or something unless i was just messing around trying out new weapons, so overall i think this game was a heavy miss and mightve been respected at first but now that the hypes gone i can admit that its overrated and its not super great and if youre thinking about buying it now just realize you probably wont get that much out of it",0
Negative,"But my experience with is has been forever tarnished by the ungodly amount of issues I have had with this game.Let me start with the most pressing issue for me, and quite a few others from what ive seen on steams discussion board alone, Invisible enemies!This was an issue that has been persisting for me since the start. every trick I tried fixed it only for a moment, and when I could see those enemies, it was for a brief few seconds before vanishing into the eather again. This only seems to happen with smaller enemies as bosses/all larger enemies pop in just fine. and its not like, they're not there, they are its just the models that wont appear. they can kill my frail ass just fine.Its extremely frustrating having to guess where the enemy will be placed. Like wise, its just as frustrating having to rely on someone elses help to even play the fucking game. I had to have someone summoned at ALL times just to progress. hell, i'd still be in godricks castle now if I didnt summon.Stuttering is also just a massive issue. I dont even know what causes it sometimes. most times, im running fine, then suddenly BAM! 10-15 frames WHILE fighting a strong enemy and god help me if I cant see it.this games performance runs all over the place for what seems like zero reason. not to mention all of the loading errors ive had, such as the world just not loading in and me falling through platforms. its not like this didnt affect just me either. ive had platforms or lifts not load in for my summons and that has caused them to make the mistake of sending it down or up and causing me to fall to my death. me falling to my death happened more often due to these issues more than most. boss AI just takes a hard dump on me far too many times. Ive had mog break and never count down, ive had godwin spam his stomp move, making it literally impossible for me to attack without getting hit (and keep in mind, ONE HIT WILL KILL MY FRAIL ASS) ive had a couple of the dungeon bosses just stand still on me. I Even had Maleketh, one of the last few bosses just straight up die on me. I didn't kill em, he just unloaded. I had to look the fight up on youtube because I got cheated out of that fight due to technical reasons!I want to believe this is a hardware issue, but that just cant be the case. I own quite a few newer titles and not one, not a SINGLE ONE RUNS THIS POORLY. and I just cant find any solutions to my problems. I don't even know if a new rig would solve half the shit I have to deal with. unplayable though it may be (at least for many out there) I still have over 100 hours in elden ring, why? Because Its innately a very fun game. its everything I would have wanted a souls game to become. mostlyPacing is a huge issue. one moment i'll be struggling with a boss, and the next, just a few levels later im power stomping through vast swaths if the game like I enabled easy mode, and thats WITH my technical issues. I would say its because im using magic, but I know even if I werent, this would still be a big problem. I hate feeling as if I have outpaced the majority of an area because I made a single choice that seemed so banal earlier. such as getting teleported to volcano manor and snake town. running through that area early on and actually overcoming that area makes you insanely strong, so areas like limgrave or WP feel as if they don't have much to offer you anymore. at least in terms of progression. Some enemies and their attacks are just straight BS. having any type of damage be instant go Fvck yourself damage isnt fun to deal with. it makes it even more BS when it has extremely little tell as to when it can happen. the simplest example is godricks whirlwind move. like, how the fvck can anyone be reasonably expected to dodge that as a melee toon? there is no wind up or any kind of tell that hes going to do it, untill hes already doing it. im not going to dodge roll if I cant SEE a threat coming, but if I dont, i'll take a crazy amount of damage that I WILL have to heal otherwise the next attack could be my end. conversely, some bosses arent static. meaning they do not have the same set of moves when you start an encounter with them. Ive had a dragon boss START THE FIGHT with an instant kill nuke that you either need bloodhound step to get away from, or need to be already a good distance away to be safe, unless you can manage a proper dodge roll. some bosses feel like they are better suited for magic, and others for melee, which would be fine, if they werent to those extremes. most times I felt as if I needed to change my build ENTIRELY to deal with some of these bosses and that just isnt fun to deal with. it can be boring as 'ell for some who use magic and brutal for those who use melee, or vice versa. I dont know why its just those two extremes, but there needs to be a bit of a buffer to take into account all of the diverse builds this game has. As it stands, I always get this feeling that im playing the game wrong because im not doing something on a fundamental level, except I am. ive played every souls game, I know how this should go, but I dont know what I'm doing wrong with some of these bosses. and hell even when I do beat em, I feel as if I cheesed them somewhat.One more hot take before im done, Torrent is completely useless for anything other than exploring. honestly, I dont know if he even needed to be included because you cant really fight with him. He takes next to no damage before you get knocked off, his dodge is one of the worst things I have ever used in a video game, and his handling is a tad strange. why is it that I cant turn my horse without moving him forward? Horses dont handle like that in the real world. they are very capable of doing so. when torrent starts his gallop animation, it also doesnt feel as if hes moving much faster than he already does. My stamina is infinite until I get into combat, what is the horse realistically for? other than jumping REEEEEALLY high sometimes.there is more that I wish I could say but I did not play the same game everyone else did. What I played is a beyond broken half finished game that looks as if konami had its hands involved. this has to be one of the worst experiences of 2022 for me so far, and its a god damn shame I wont ever be able to see this game in its prime for the first time. I know elden ring is good, ive seen the gameplay second hand. but thats all i'll ever see it as. a second hand game im not worthy of playing.",0
Negative,"A mixed bag. The game's highs, like exploration and art design are incredible. However, the game's lows, like reused content and balance are the lowest I have seen in a From Soft game. The first 40-60 hours are amazing because everything is relatively new and the world is a blast to explore. However, beyond that, the game gets repetitive, fast. There is an absurd amount of reused content: bosses, dungeons, even regular enemies. I heard somewhere that this game has 100+ boss encounters, but only 9 of them are unique. Let that sync in.My biggest disappointment with ER by far was that beating most bosses and the game itself didn't feel rewarding at all. A lot of bosses are so poorly balanced that fighting them boiled down to finding ways to out-cheese the game. There are a few gems in there, but the vast majority of bosses were either too easy and unmemorable, or just too frustrating to enjoy.",0

Negative,"Even though it often drops frame, and some bosses have unreasonable pattern(e.g. Godrick's storm pattern) it's worth to play. Exploring beautiful big world with souls style actions is very fun.But I can't recommend it because of its multiplayer system.I played Darksouls 1,2,3, Bloodborne and Sekiro with platinum achievement. Therefore I'm familiar with Fromsoft's multi play system. Even so they keep stick to use there own system even its not fit for open world game. Too many fog walls. Those keep cut off the flows of game play. That is very annoyed. It was annoyed at other souls series too but those were at least reasonable because it was stage based game. But in open world, it isn't. The users have to disconnect their session and reconnect inside of fog walls. it can't be called OPEN world.Solution: If it is concerned that Goldfinger users will not able to claim their rewards, allow users to set a multiplayer password to eliminate fog walls. This is because there is a high probability that they will give up their rewards rather than playing alone. To summon others, we need to use an item, stay at same area, and There must be more than one alive boss.One of the big charming point of open world game is exploring the field. But because of the last requirement, we need to find all of the hidden monster, item or any other nice place Before you beat the final boss of the field. If you find some place to visit after you kill them? well, go alone or maybe next NG?It's just a way to erase their fine work and charming point. Obviously, there are some user who want to play with someone others. That kind of users are usually just give up to play there if they have to be alone.Solution: Same with #1, The rewards will not be their matter. Too many invader. Literally, too many. I met 5 invaders in 16 min. We were not PvP user. Even we had better environment than invaders, Cutting game flow or playing passively to not to lose our runes are not fun. Moreover, this situation happens again and again after 3 minutes. On other series, at least there're some good news that ""We can enjoy PvE at least 5~10 min""! And we expected on this game that the invade cooldown must be longer than other series. But it just disappeared.I know that invader system is one of the main system and unique system of Souls series. But there're big reasons that is enough to remove it in this game.1. This game is open world game. The biggest fun parts of open world game is exploring, not fighting. invader system takes the users chance to explore this beautiful world.2. There're many beginners of Souls series which are more than other series. This game is most - famous and spotlighted game of Souls Series. Therefore there're lots of new players who didn't played any Souls series. For them, this invader system can be too tough.3. This game has too big field to play PvP. If the invaders just ran away and hide, that becomes big stress to the host player. And that stress is not a good, challenging stress. It's just annoyed.4. To get good item for PvP. Users have to visit specific place. Which means this PvP without mutual consent, can be unfair fight very easier than other Stage based series. Some users might can't find the good item until they end this game. Because there're too many good place to look around.5. Even for the invaders, it's usually unfair fight. The host has always more than 1 companion. And it's of course easy to lose.Therefore, We can encourage PvP-only fields (like, Dark Souls 3) So that make the PvE users no need to be stressed out because of unwanted PvP. And make the PvP users can fight on fair environment.Considering the stage division criteria of this game, 20 minutes is a reasonable time.If it worried about match time of invade. We can consider to encourage PvP-only fields. Or, (I don't think it's the ""Best"" option, but.) we might allow to invade to single players too. We experienced sudden disconnect a lot. Sometimes it happened 3 times within 5 minute. Farming multi play items because of unstable session isn't fun.Solution?: Sadly, I'm not an engineer. Hwaiting! From! As we knows, it's open world game. it's more complicate than clear the same stage one more time. Users might feels bored if they has to visit same place that is already explored with other session to loot the items. There're plenty of nice place to visit. Users won't want to waste time to revisit same place.Solution: Provide Same rewards to co-op users who set password. and kill the same boss, chest, and items on the world of co-op user. This will synchronized their progress and also maintain a system for gold finger users to farm Rune arcs.Like I said, It's good game to play alone or with other random player (even though it can be disconnected). I do hope that those problems will be solved so that users can enjoy this great game with their friends without any annoyed or uncomfortable issues.",0
Negative,"While i am a big fan of Soulslike games, I play on PC. If you are a console gamer and like Soulslike games, this is the pinnacle 10/10 game. However, I have to review this as a PC gamer. The controls are terrible. Worse than DS3. Economy of input is a hallmark for ease of use in any game. how many clicks of a button does it take to accomplish an action. Not only does Elden Ring have 4x the required clicks-per-action of other games, its sparce and lacking keybind system means you cannot speed up the process yourself. Want to mount your house? You need to click 2 keyboard keys at the same time, far enough away from each other that you must remove your hand from the mouse. Move a slider bar in the systems menu? 3 clicks per slider bar. Want to look up how to accomplish something on Keyboard? No ingame information. The only internet information is from other players. Seriously, it is not this hard to make a game PC compatible. They had to go through EXTRA work to make it difficult and annoying. This will hopefully either be patched by developers (extremely unlikely) or will remain a sub-par experience until modders fix what the developers could not.",0
Negative,My comments are only based on the PC port of this product and not the gameplay itself. I could not get to the gameplay itself easily which tainted the entire experience. This feels like a bad PC port of a Playstation 2 game and if you are going to claim to support PC in this day and age I expect more. You essentially have to have a controller to use this game easily. I made it into the game but the graphics were sub par at best and navigating the interface with keyboard and mouse was almost unusable. If I'm going to play with a controller I'll go play on my console and not PC. That coupled with no ultra-wide support and poor frame rate means I'm out. My recommendation? If you want to enjoy this game go buy it on a console and get a better experience. From software does not appear to care about the PC market enough to even make the menus function properly. Disappointed.,0
Negative,"I keep getting invisible enemies, cool game tho.",0
Negative,I LOVE this game and I will play it even with the massive fps drops.But I have to put a negative review so it would be resolved faster and future buyers are aware of the problem.,0
Negative,"Broken.Edit: This game seems to work for a lot of people, and I do keep updating and trying this seemingly beautiful game. Nonetheless, I cannot encounter just about anything without the game being completely unstable and unplayable. Has not been worth the time or money I've put into this. Will come back far in the future to see if it's any better.",0
Negative,"This game literally makes me sick when I play. Played for almost an hour on launch day and felt nauseous. Had to stop playing and even then it took a bit after I stopped to feel better. I'm not someone who generally gets sick from gaming, either. I've never been sick playing any other game (nor do I ever get car sick, air sick, or sick while watching movies or shows). Dying Light, Doom, Portal, etc. were all fine for me. This game is not. If I had to guess, I think it's a combination of the very low FOV that you can't adjust, the microstuttering I'm getting, the random changes from 60 to 30 fps at various points, random frame drops down below 50 fps (my hardware is well above the ""Recommended"" specs for the game and I'm playing at 1440p), and the obscene amount of texture pop in in the world.It's a shame because what I was able to play before feeling sick was awesome and I've been hyped and anticipating this game since its announcement. But it's completely unplayable for me right now and I'll likely be refunding.",0
Negative,"Saw the negative reviews about the frame rate, gave the game the benefit of the doubt, and now I am filled with regret. If you an enjoyable game play experience, do not buy this game. Dodging attacks is essentially a guessing game for how much the game will stutter with any given camera angle. Plus there is the added bonus of random inputs being eaten, and not registering at all. Restarted the game and the PC, and even reset the game settings a few times as well, of which nothing changed. In a game where precision and timing are essential tools in game play, both of these recurring issues cause these fundamental mechanics to be thrown out of the window. In the game's current state, I cannot and will not recommend this game to anyone except hardcore fans of the series.",0
Negative,"As Amazing as this game wouldve been to play my old PC simply cant play it, Even though it managed to run Dark souls 1-3 and Sekiro at 60 FPS, ELDEN RING has Bested my PC.On release the game actually loaded in, but the Frames started dropping the moment I entered character Creation, but it still seemed Playable and I was even able to get into the start of the game. Then I noticed black flickering boxes on light textures and constant low framerate, still seemed playable until the game decided to kick me out of the game for low frame rate.Put me right back to the title screen, I thought I'd be able to exit the game from there but after pressing ""any button"" the pop up of ""LOW FRAME RATE DETECTED RETURNING TO TITLE SCREEN"" kept me in the title screen. I was forced to FORCE CLOSE the game on task manager.After that I attempted to run the game a second time but now the game REFUSES to start and only a white box in its place before closing. Now I am unable to run the game as it no longer responds.So Unless you have a Proper Gaming PC I'd RECOMMEND you DON'T BUY THE GAME",0
Negative,"shite game from shite devs! mindless pigsWHERE is my OST idiots? I WANT them play on my phone not on my dumb PC ONLY !?and you call this pseudo COOP a new multiplayer system ?where is my settings for FOV tunning ?i got 3080 Ti with 32 cores and want to play that shit with 144Hz on my monitor ! not capped 60 LOLDiD i buy delux edition for beta testing ?RENAME your game ""Elden SHiT"" , .",0
Negative,"Optimisation sucks ass. On Max settings game looks like Dark Souls 3 or Sekiro yet has insane stutter issues. When you put the graphics on low it looks worse than Dark Souls 2, at the point where Counter-Strike Source looks very good. Performance on Low settings is better but not by much. Previous FromSoft games were optimized compared to Elden Ring, they ran max settings at 60 locked. This is Cyberpunk all over again.",0
Negative,"Feels like this game has an open world just for the sake of having an open world. Gone are the tightly-designed interconnected areas of every other Dark Souls / Sekiro / Bloodborne game. In this game you'll only find largely empty open fields with almost nothing that feels worth exploring for, connecting several large dungeon/castle areas that each feel like half of a level from a previous game. I've made it at least past the halfway point of the game a couple times and I just have no motivation to wander around a bland open world getting the same useless materials, fighting the same reskinned mobs and reused bosses, for rewards that feel not worth my time.Boss design also seems to be a casualty of the new open world. Previous games generally knew what you would reasonably have access to and what level you'd be by the time you'd reach a certain point and could design encounters around that, but Elden Ring seems to expect you to just wander around and grind for levels or weapons when you hit a gatekeeper boss.I've tried to get into this game at least 5 times since release and I just can't do it, and that is so frustrating to me as someone who loves the rest of the series.",0
Negative,"Unable to recommend at this time.The PC port is poor and the KB+M options are abysmal.With fluctuating FPS getting in the way of timing dodge and parry it makes even the easiest enemies difficult, problems persist even at the lowest settings. I expected a rough launch but not a completely unoptimized one.From Software also seems to have decided the Auto-center camera, which turns sideways movement into a circle strafe, is still a good idea. It generates unneeded movement and can induce motion sickness and extra camera wobble as you compensate for it. This was solved in Sekiro with a mod, From Software never actually fixed it.Here's to hoping it gets some much needed QoL updates in the next three months, and someone finds a way around that damned auto-camera",0
Negative,"Either all these 10/10 reviews were bought/influenced or the reviewed versions were played on console and in offline mode.Really not sure how FromSoftware can release a game in such a poor optimization state. Constant stuttering, none of the fixes truly eliminate it completely, capped FPS in the year 2022 because of nonsense console ports. Anyone on the FromSoftware team could have played this game on PC for an hour and known it's not completely ready for release and could have delayed the PC release, but nope - the bottom line always has the final say.People also shouldn't have to tweak their graphics settings and turn a bunch of settings off just to eliminate stuttering. We're playing on PC because we expect a smooth, better looking experience. People in my situation who are running a 3080 TI, not even playing at 4K, should be able to run it at stable frames and the fact this is an issue is ridiculous. I can play Red Dead Redemption 2 at max settings and never sniff lower than 60 FPS. In Elden Ring, it's very common to dip into the low 40s and that's in addition to the stuttering.",0
Negative,"I was planning to leave a really good review once I complete this game, but since the new DLC came out, the game runs HORRIBLY. I was previously playing this game at 1440p, max settings (minus ray tracing), at 60 FPS with not a single frame drop. Since the DLC, no matter what settings I use, lowest resolution, lowest settings, my FPS is no higher than 53 FPS, and won't go a digit higher, even in the menu! This has really pissed me off because I was constantly praising this game and recommending it to friends, but now it feels unplayable to me because it's an uncomfortable experience. On another note, I also can't play online on my Steam Deck anymore because of some new settings the developers implemented. I will continue playing on my Steam Deck, because luckily the frame rate was sitting on 45-50 FPS on average anyway, and it's actually quite nice not seeing those stupid messages spammed all over the ground by other players.As soon as these performance issues are fixed, I will change my review, but as it stands, I can't recommend a game that has such a problem.",0
Negative,Can't jump on the back of a turtle. Unplayable.,0
Negative,Try working out every time you die.I hate this game now.got ripped tho so. eh.,0
Negative,"FIX YOUR FUCKING GAME. The developers have acknowledged the last second major frame rate issue so no this isn't a ""your pc sux"" thing. The MAIN issue the frame drops cause is that IF YOU PRESS AN INPUT DURING A DROPPED FRAME IT DOES NOT EXECUTE. This means if you are fighting something and you press dodge during one of the frame drops IT WILL NOT READ THE INPUT. Ontop of this the game is locked at 60 FPS. The inputs are tied to the frame rate so there is NO GETTING AROUND THE DROPPED INPUT DROPPED FRAME ISSUE UNTIL THE DEVS FIX IT. The review copy of the game ran perfectly fine but then the devs added some bullshit to it on release that broke the game entirely. In a game where a single missed input can cause instant death this is absolutely unacceptable. Do not buy this shit until it is fixed. Great game but simply not worth your money as of writing this.Update: So the game still has performance issues but it has gotten a little better. Definitely nowhere near as bad as it was. But now the real question is: Do you support this antiquated level of quality in 2022, ignoring it because the game itself is content packed and all-around enjoyable. Or do you hold the developers accountable for releasing an arguably broken ass PC port. I don't want this to become the next Bethesda type shit where everyone turns a blind eye to all the game breaking bugs/glitches because the game is fun. Deep down this game IS great and there is A LOT to unpack here content wise which makes this even tougher to rate. I'm not trying to be a stick in the mud. I get it that sometimes games have little quirks, or a couple bugs, but what the fuck why is this game having trouble keeping consistent frame rates even though you aren't allowed to run it higher than 60 FPS. Like. There just isn't an excuse. The game is not demanding so what is going on here?",0
Negative,"It's amazing how many people seem to blatantly ignore the negative aspects of this game. To name a few: CRASHES: Despite having a PC with the recommended hardware and updated drivers, this poorly optimized game still crashes. I even played with a friend, and she had the same issue. Dismissing these problems with arguments like ""get a better PC"" is invalid. MULTIPLAYER:As mentioned earlier, I played co-op, and it's bewildering that this is marketed as a multiplayer game. Random disconnections occur after playing for a while, and sometimes the game won't let you connect even with a stable internet connection. You want to enjoy the game peacefully, but within seconds, an invader, who seems to have farmed the best PvP gear, enters your world. Combat isn't enjoyable due to the game's poor hit detection. In co-op, I never wanted to let other players' interference disrupt my experience. PvP was never my primary objective; it was simply about enjoying the game. However, PVP was forced onto me, since can't disable this feature. It's also worth noting that when an invader spawns, they have like a 5-second immunity period, allowing them to buff themselves multiple times while you can't retaliate. It's a frustrating experience. Additionally, you can't drop certain items, which doesn't make sense. You have crafting components for some online items you need to connect, but you can't drop them. However, you can drop the required flowers. Smithing stones are excessively abundant, but you can't drop them either. Everything regarding multiplayer is frustrating, and it seems everyone just accepts it because it's a game from FromSoftware, which is a protected company. It's pathetic to see people bending over backward for an exploiting company. UNFAIRNESS:I also find it funny that many moments of death in the game feel unfair and unavoidable. For instance, I ran toward a cliff on foot, and it fell apart, launching me to my death. How could I have seen that coming? Oh, right, because I COULDN'T. It's unnecessary and frustrating. OPEN-WORLD: Now, the following is just my opinion, and it may vary, but I find the open-world system terrible. On my first playthrough, it was confusing and agonizing to navigate, especially since I played it blindly, unlike the majority of this community who watched Let's Plays and guides. In this regard, I preferred Dark Souls. Elden Ring's open world feels lazily implemented. Most of the time, there isn't much to explore in the open-world areas (I'm referring to the parts where you can use the horse) until you reach a castle or cave. It feels like little love went into it. BUGS:I encountered some bugs, such as clipping through walls, enemies glitching through walls, and occasional double-damage calculations. I understand that it's a massive game, but I wanted to mention it nonetheless. REUSED DESIGNS:It's amusing how often the same enemies appear in this game, reappearing from other regions and even other Souls games. In other games, this is often criticized, but when FromSoftware does it, it's somehow acceptable. For example, boss enemies appearing as common enemies (e.g., Godskin Noble, Apostle, Dragons, Erdtree, and many more) and the reuse of enemies like frogs and dogs from previous Souls games. There are so many recycled game models; it's mind-boggling. CLIFF BORDER:Some weapon attacks ignore cliff borders, leading to your character's death from falling. JUMPING:Jumping feels clunky.There's so much more I could delve into, but I'll wrap it up here to maintain a civil tone in this review. It's quite an accomplishment in itself to keep from resorting to vulgarity. With 128.6 hours invested and a perfect 100% achievement completion, I have confidence in the validity of my criticisms. Of course, there are positive aspects of the game that have been mentioned countless times in other reviews. I'd love a world where everyone thinks for themselves and doesn't just copy-paste opinions, while defending the most protected company of our generation, even more so than Bethesda.",0
Negative,"When/if they uncap the FPS and support for ultrawide monitors is added It'll get a positive review from me. You'd think a AAA developer would figure out how to properly port a game to PC on their 4th attempt, yet here we are.",0
Negative,"At times like this I really wish Steam would add something between positive and negative review. Elden Ring is a new universe only in name. If you played Souls series and Bloodborne you will, time and time again, notice very similar themes, narrative, dialogues and even enemy patterns. If this is something you wanted with addition of open world (although with huge empty spaces and copy paste dungeons) and mounted combat? Then go for it - Souls fans will love it, for newcomers it will be a good start to FromSoft games as well. Personally I enjoyed the experience.Then why negative review? Because while the game is an improved Dark Souls title in terms of gameplay, it definetly not an absolute masterpiece as most of ""game journalist"" will make you think.General balance of enemies and bossfights is not great. Difficulty spikes are really noticable in late game and it's riddled with unfun ""gotcha, dodge or die"" moves which will one-shot you even if you're really tanky. I don't mind game being diffcult if it's fair like Sekiro was for example. Elden Ring is not it.In terms of PvP clearly someone responsible for balancing took a long vacation in FS or stoped showing for work. Never before their game was so pumped with weapon art spaming which destroys an oponent in one combo.Also apparently 11 years is not enough time for FS to rework their sh*tty net code and generally make the coop and PvP a bearable experience. Inability to connect after defeating nearby boss (in a goddamn open world game), weird instancing, constant disconnects, 2 second lags in PvP, invasion system being really dumb in terms of balance and concept (lack of convenants). Maybe next time you don't hire G.R.R. Martin to come up with fancy names and instead rework your multiplayer system so it is actually user friendly, how about that?Is Elden Ring a good game? Yes.Is it a good open world game? Better then most.Is it fun both alone and in coop? Definetly.Is it a FS magnus opum deserving all the praise it gets? Not really.",0
Negative,The true boss of this game is FromSoftware themselves. Latest update broke my game so lost 100 hours of gameplay.,0
Negative,PC performance is abysmal. worst AAA release in recent memoryupdate: the game part is bad too,0
Negative,Its like they didnt even bother trying the game out before releasing it.,0
Negative,"When starting the game up you get one of two options:- Amazing, fun, GOTY gameplayor- Run like a slideshow presentationIf this can get fixed in the future, I'd recommend this easily but for now consider playing something less frustrating to run.",0
Negative,"A step back if compared to Sekiro, and a really bad execution of the Open World design.The problem lies in the choices that From Software decided to take in this game and when you reach the Mid-game you start to see them all. Elden Ring has a lot of good ideas that are taken from other games of the genre, but it start to become boring and frustrating, because: - it has an Open World that is just as an excuse to walk for kilometers without finding nothing really rewarding; - the dungeons are repetitive and not very diversified. Bloodborne's are much more interesting in comparison; - bosses are ridicolusly unfair and not fun to challenge, since the punishment for your mistakes is always an impossibility yo heal yourself or study the boss movements.and in the worst cases you get one-shotted; - too much copy-paste and reskins for the enemies. Is not a big deal, but when you have to fight the same enemy more than four times, just with buffed HP and buffed damage, you realize that something is wrong;- poise still doesn't work, like DS3;- the story is an heated soup.Worst product ever bought so far.",0
Negative,"Extremely poor performance after arriving into the open world. As of right now I'd say wait until a few performance patches before purchasing. Still gonna keep in my library and hopefully this game gets patched to run better soon. Shame, game looked awesome.",0
Negative,"Bought the game really looking forward to it, comes to it i finished installing it. Boom white screen and crash, I had gone through every article and youtube video through hundreds of steps to attempt and fix it even the hassle of reinstalling the game, nothing no matter what I had done it would not launch. Now i don't not recommend this game as the graphics are amazing and as an enjoyer of hard souls like games i think its amazing, but seeing as i legit can't play the game i have only bad input from here.",0
Negative,"Elden Ring asks the question: how would an open world Dark Souls work? And then answers it around 50 hours in: it doesn't. The world design and atmosphere are stunning, but the scale of the whole game is simply too large to be filled with the limited gameplay it actually offers. The game counts almost single-handedly on your desire to scour the world for equipment as an incentive to drive forward and uncover characters, lore, and directional clues - but character builds are centered around your equipment, and 95% of what's in the (very, very large and detailed) world isn't actually useful for the character you're playing. It's only compounded by the fact that most armour is balanced to be roughly equal, and if you're counting on your exploration rewarding you with a cool new armour upgrade to replace your starter set, you're going to be very, very disappointed.This approach probably would have worked if the scaling of enemy rune drops was fine tuned, with side bosses offering meaningful character level boosts so that if the piece of gear they drop is irrelevant, the player still feels rewarded. Before long, however, I was playing for the charm and exploration for its own sake rather than gameplay itself - a dangerous position for a very lengthy experience to find itself in.Combat, as always, is quite good, and some of the main boss fights (particularly the earlier story ones) were a hoot. Unfortunately, the balance inevitably turns into a sort of glass cannon experience in which everything including you does high damage and has little health/armour, so even major boss fights are quick and frustrating when you die, and then punctuated by being over very quickly when you happen to get a good hit and win. In this way, many of my wins felt like big anti-climaxes by midgame. I think if the game scaled damage down and reduced your available healing pool significantly, it would make for slightly more drawn out battles in which putting in the effort to learn a boss's moves would be more rewarding, and winning would be more satisfying.The other core element that translated badly to the large open world is the storytelling, which stubbornly sticks to the traditional Souls-like formula of a detailed world with a threadbare plot that drip-feeds info and lore and leaves it to the player to interpret. That's all sort of interesting and works brilliantly in a tight, semi-linear game with clear progression, but in a vast open world I found myself needing some kind of dramatic tension, sense of urgency, personal stake or at least clear understanding of why I was doing what I was doing, and Elden Ring doesn't deliver that sort of experience - at least, not where I'd gotten up to. I was disappointed to realise I'd had enough and become bored after clearing Limgrave+Liurnia+Caelid regions. From what others have said, however, the latter half of the game feels even more of a slog.Finally, the social element of leaving messages isn't really working well, with the vast majority of messages being from mouthbreathers copying each others jokes about buttholes and Fortnite all around the map and presumably patting themselves warmly on the back afterward. The community sense of discovery and sharing, which in some cases is essential due to the game's obscure design, is greatly Tarnished by this, such that toward the end of my play I was avoiding reading messages altogether.Elden Ring isn't a bad game - it just isn't quite the big deal it wants to be. There's fun to be had here and it's probably worth grabbing the game and playing it through using a guide instead of trying to discover everything yourself and burning out. That said, I think next time I have a hankering, I'll be picking up Dark Souls instead, and I'm not ""recommending"" this on balance.",0
Negative,pretty mid. get dark souls instead.,0
Negative,"Starts out fun, Gets terrible later on. It does the open world aspect well but drops the ball on everything else. Especially bosses which should be the highlight of the game, Buy Sekiro instead.",0
Negative,"This game is not for everyone. Don't feel guilty if you cannot enjoy it.One more complain is about multiplayer mode. It is very unstable. Me and my friend tried several times and most of them failed. We got kicked out during a fight. We spend 2 hours tried to fight a boss together, but eventually the obstacle is not even the boss.",0
Negative,"Probably a really good game, but not on the platforms that I use.Before anyone keeps reading, I just want you to know I was playing this on a Steam Deck. Do not keep reading if you have not played this on deck. This review will not help you if you do, nor will it be of any substance to those that already play.I bought this game yesterday. First boot resulted in a white screen with nowhere to go, so I restarted the game and everything was fine.Fast forward to today and things aren't so peachy.One more thing that I want to get out of the way:Valve's efforts getting this game working at all is nothing short of a technological marvel. The PC port is clearly not optimized like the console counterparts.The fact that this game runs at 40fps and not 60 doesn't concern me, but what DOES concern me is the ""verified"" rating.Look, I jumped from Nintendo to my steam deck not terribly long ago, so clearly my gaming standards are low on the techy side of things. But why is the game just not launching half the time I launch the game? Its frustrating. As previously mentioned, the issue I'm having revolves around the white screen where the game (seemingly) doesn't load. Should I mention that I needed to use a command line and specific proton version to make it run kind of better? That's not very ""verified"" behavior to me.Another issue I'm having, albeit minor in the grand scheme of things; is the resolution. Why was 16:10 working on first boot, but not any time after? I've looked through many forums and found out the hard way that FromSoft is very strict on aspect ratios. Ok, that's fine; but why was it even an option to begin with? 1280x800 is literally a graphic setting but no matter what I did it wouldn't go to the proper 16:10 ratio.At this point I've spent more time trying to resolve issues than actually playing the game, so to Bandai and FromSoft;You may receive my money one day. But it won't be through PC. That is all.",0
Negative,"Formsoftware has a reputation of making these well crafted worlds filled with lore exploration, and tough combat. Elden Ring is the same ideas applied to an open world setting. What this game is, is exactly what you think it is. Elden Ring is Dark Souls but open world. You have the same character design, enemy ideas, and combat you would expect from dark souls. There are multiple poison swamps that damage you as well as slow you down, there are castles with lords resting at the tops, and secret areas with the strongest bosses in the series. My biggest issue with the game is the open world because its utilizing Formsoftware's style of story telling. There is some resemblance of a story that you will need to watch some guy on YouTube discuss while he goes through item descriptions to fully understand because this game gives very little direction, apart from some arrows that only direct you in the area of one of the major bosses; you have no reason for why you need to rampage through the lands between killing everything in your way. The online works the exact same as it did in previous games that had online (Not Sekiro) You need to use an item to put down your sign and whose game your sign appears is dependent upon your level. Once again this is hindered by the open world. As players are free to go in any order this will minimize the players by fracturing the player base until the late game where it converges into a single path. Yes, the game is new player friendly with the addition of NPC Spirits you can summon for difficult encounters allowing you to never need to rely on the community for help and will be a blessing in a couple years when most players have moved on. Along with the open world you can go somewhere else if you think an area is too hard level up get stronger and then return. Helping to prevent the feeling of hopelessness caused by beating your head against the same thing over and over again. This is a long game filled with many things to make it easier to it easier the ability to respec your character mid game is very helpful if you spend a lot of levels on a stat only to find out your play style is different or you like something better, but make no mistake the entire game resolves around the combat there is little else to do. Everything you do is to make your character stronger. The open world is designed to transform you into the combat veteran capable of conquering anything thrown at you. Overall this game is filled to the brim with enemies and places to explore but once your halfway through you will start to see the same ideas, the same enemies, and even the same bosses. This game overstays its welcome and should only be attempted by players who love the combat Formsoftware is know for or have hundreds of hours to spend getting turned around and stumbling through the open world",0
Negative,"Let me start with what I liked: I really liked the beginning areas, Limgrave and the Weeping Peninsula. Outside of the gargoyle goblins in dungeons, the enemies in these areas are fair and fun to go against. The encounters are designed to teach new players how to play and veteran players what's different. Margit is a fantastic first true boss, challenging but not unfair, he attacks quickly but follows a pattern, he can deal a lot of damage but has a lengthy windup time, as well most of his moves are parry-able.Addendum, July 2024: The Seamless Co-op mod is also a wonderful addition to the game, being able to play with friends from start to finish makes the game a lot more enjoyable and brings build variety to the forefront even more.Now for what I didn't like: The camera and lock-on are easily the worst they've ever been, trying to lock-onto huge or flying enemies just makes combat more difficult to maneuver than if you controlled the camera yourself. The mid and late game enemy design is reminiscent of Dark Souls 3 with the speed of attacks and length of combos, however most enemies have very little cooldown between combos and infinite spellcasting capabilities, and this is compounded with the fact that rolling has fewer i-frames than Dark Souls 3 making you far easier to hit near the end of a roll. Bosses are especially egregious, due to most having an absurd amount of poise, all while being able to break the poise of players wearing super-heavy armor while the player is attacking with a colossal weapon, in one or two hits. Enemies have i-frames while getting up from a critical attack, however the player doesn't get i-frames and cannot roll out of getting up from a strong attack anymore. Late game enemies deal an absurd amount of damage, killing in two hits or even one hit unless players dump points in vigor and have a significant amount of damage negation (40+ vigor and 25%+ damage negation). Overall the mid and late game combat just feel difficult for the sake of being arbitrarily hard, like if Elden Ring was made by somebody who had only seen and heard about Soulsborne difficulty and never played one themselves.Finally, let me just say visually the game is fantastic, the world and environments are very pleasing and interesting, the effects are impressive, and the ambient noise and music are pleasing to listen to. However the game has an issue with caching shaders, meaning that there's constant lag spikes when entering different areas or fighting enemies you haven't encountered in a while.If you enjoyed Dark Souls 2 and 3 and do not mind artificial difficulty, I do believe Elden Ring is worth trying out. However if you did not enjoy Dark Souls 2 and 3 or really do not like artificial difficulty like myself, I would recommend just looking into the world and story and not spending the time or money on it.",0
Negative,"I really wanted to like Elden Ring.After months of hearing praise from all my friends, I decided to upgrade my GPU and actually play the game. Coming from Sekiro, I had pretty high expectations for Elden Ring. At first I was impressed by the visuals, the mystery and freedom the game left to the player. However, as I got accustomed to the games mechanics, I couldn't help but feel disappointed. I know how enthusiastic the Elden Ring community is about the game, hardly accepting any criticism, but in my opinion Elden Ring does not have an interesting combat system or a fun gameplay loop. Much of this is largely help back by the ""open-world"" style of the game. I recognize the tremendous amount of work that went into the artstyle, music and assets of the game. This is not the problem here.Let's start with the combat system: This game punishes you for trying to play certain playstyles and forces you into using crutches to defeat bosses. If you want to play the game ""your way"" you will have to pay for it with a lot of your time and effort. For example, using summons makes some bosses 10x easier, some bosses are borderline impossible without them. The lack of any early hint or direction for how to start building your character puts you into an awkward position where it is hard to re-spec beyond just points (i.e. upgrading weapons, acquiring gear). Another gripe is just the nature of combat in Elden Ring. This is just my opinion, but dodge-rolling and waiting for an opening, just isn't as fun or epic as Sekiro's high octane fights. Beyond memorizing all attack patterns of your enemies, there is no element of ""mastery"" involved. It boils down to an arduous grind, which does not get remedied by satisfying rewards or story clues. For me, there is no power fantasy here. In Sekiro I felt like I bested my opponent in a straight duel, with both of us giving everything. In Elden Ring, you are essentially trying to find out how each boss was coded until you find out that you can go after his tail to defeat them. This just isn't fun to me. But fine, Dark Souls 3 is also a fan favourite, maybe the combat system just isn't for me or I didn't find the right weapons. What DS3 didn't have is open-world gameplay - something so utterly pointless, the development decision absolutely baffles me. Exploring this ""world"" is about as interesting as a university lecture on databases. It feels empty, with random enemies scattered all over. What do they offer? Absolutely nothing beyond runes and F-Tier items. It doesn't feel satisfying to go on a 2 hour detour just to find . nothing. I went in blind, as advised by friends, and while playing I wished I had just watches some sort of walk through and took the shortest path to some of the more interesting enemies. The main bosses are intricate, well designed and hard. Too bad you are kind of forced to explore the empty boring wastelands of the lands between, unless you want to get ""vigor-checked.""I think this game's problem is guidance. It is offering too much freedom to the player, so much so that it eliminates a sense of purpose and direction. Often you feel like your stats/gear just aren't good enough to make a fight winnable - not the type of power fantasy I'm after",0
Negative,"Fromsoft bit off more than they could chew with a world that massive. Assets, enemies and prominently bosses are re-used into oblivion. I can't give an count or even an estimate how many Erdtree/Putrid avatars and identical dragons there are. In most cases there isn't even a minor attempt to make small adjustments. Here's a boss you've fought 5 times already, have fun!The end-game area's are lacking in what the world has to offer, they feel empty and what's given are earlier enemies. At the Haligtree, I can't recall a single enemy (besides the endboss) that was unique to the game.Above the blatant copy-paste jobs, the challenges (esp near the end of the game) don't feel fair. It felt as if you're fighting the game itself instead of a boss. Victories aren't rewarding because you don't win by learning and persevering, but with finding ways to out-cheese the game.The best example is the Godskin Duo, a bad, un-enjoyable fight. They're two bosses you'd already encountered, thrown in an arena. They both move at the same speed, posses ranged attacks and have AoE-attacks in their arsenal. There's no 'right' way to beat them, you start the fight and pray for not too many overlapping AoE's or attacks.Balancing is non-existent, this felt like it was handled by an intern as an afterthought. Most of the game felt like a casual stroll through the park until the end. There they pulled an 180 and made an unfair mess with annoying ganks, attacks that require frame-perfect dodges. I wonder if they were adding moves from bloodborne and Sekiro-bosses, while forgetting your character can't deal with that. And offensive power bizarrely out-scales any amount of hp and defense you can get.All of the above would've been fine f the online-part was enjoyable. I could complain about how the next step in making things for invaders harder might be too much. But you barely get to invade without disconnecting. Coop-sessions and summons as a Hunter are the same deal. Helping with Malenia, Blade of Miquella, is rolling a die when going into the 2nd phase, sometimes it's fine, often you get kicked out of the session. Leaving me with not bothering because every attempt is just a gamble (above the risk of the host dying).Even with friends with a proven stable connection in other games, the same issues persist. With the online part being this dysfunctional. The game felt lonely, barely people to summon, you can't participate in people's game. Point down!",0

Negative,"There's a great game here, but it drowns it shitty interfaces and extremely poor controls. I hate controllers and have been playing with mouse and keyboard. I have no opinion on how well the game works with controllers.I see absolutely no reason why this game shouln't work extremely well with mouse and keyboard other than utter lazyness from the developers behalf. I mean, the simplest things, like being able to use your items in your pouch with a single keypress isn't possible. Just figuring out how to put things in your pouch in the first place is highly unintuitive. Everything is plastered with hints to what controller keys to press. Nothing to hint what keys to use.Your weapon has a skill- so does your shield. Apparently it isn't possible to use your weapons skill if you havea shield equipped? I'm not sure if that's a controller thing or just a super weird design choice. If the latter then the game needs to do a way better job at explaining this.It seems clear to me they don't care about people playing the game without controllers. I guess that is ok. They just need to be honest about it then and entirely remove the option to play the game without one.",0

Negative,"If this game wasn't so close to amazing I would not be so incredibly annoyed with it. Single player is great, like 8 out of 10 great. It's challenging, it's beautiful, it has a variety of play styles that are fun and interesting. I was so excited to play with friends that I bought it for not one but two friends, and this isn't a cheap game. I was all in. When you can play with a friend I'd say it goes all the way to a 9 out of 10. But. then you start having to deal with invaders. If you play with friends you WILL get invaded. In the first 5 minutes. Every time you connect. And you have to connect with friends a lot because multiplayer is not stable. You frequently lose your connection and have to reconnect. And that means more invaders. And the invaders are usually able to one shot you with cheese builds. So you will have to build with pvp in mind if you want to play with friends at all. And that is very different from playing the game normally. It's not fun. As long as you give up enjoying yourself and focus solely on killing invaders you MIGHT be able to get a few minutes of play before another jerk comes in that you have to deal with. This takes what should be a 9/10 and drops it to a 7 out of 10 at best. It is WORSE than the single player experience. It doesn't have to be this way, but that's the way they made it.",0
Negative,"It's just not ds4 nor something different, just reworked ds3 with bad game mechanics and the worst stuff in the franchise reunited in one single game. I really tried to enjoy it but even forcing myself to play it for 100h but it wasn't enough. The only good stuff in the game was 3 or 4 Evergals, 4 Bosses and even in late game the whole game looks like a meat & grind, even with an Damage Optmized build you won't do much without ghosts, phantoms or weapon arts, the game forces you to use at least 4 or 5 different playstyles or you won't be able do keep on without major stress/effort. I know i'm being harsh as fuck on the game but if I could get my money back i'd probably would. I highly sugest playing ds3 + DLC's before trying this game if you actually give a shit about souls at all",0
Negative,"I absolutely adore this game. I mean, just look at my playtime. The issue is the FPS drops. Seriously bad FPS drops for a good 1-2 seconds. I have an RTX 2070 so I know it's capable of playing this game on max settings. None of the graphic settings change this and I had to mess with the Nvidia control panel, setting the shader cache to unlimited and setting Vsync to Fast, as well as capping FPS at 60. This fixed the issue. And then patch 1.02 drops and everything goes back to stuttering and they nerfed everything to boot.I really wanna recommend this game, but I don't think they'll do anything about the PC port unless we show that we're not willing to put up with this kinda thing with our votes.",0

Negative,"I'm not recommending this game, strictly from a co-op perspective. If you're looking to get this game because you wanted a rich, challenging, solid PvE experience with your friends or family, then keep going.Apparently, Elden Ring carried with it Dark Souls' PvP invasion system. This PvP system automatically becomes active the moment you join up with your friends, and there's no way to change this.My husband and I were looking forward to Co-Oping this game; it's not often games have super challenging PvE experiences like this while also allowing co-op. We joined up right after the ""tutorial,"" and after a mere 2 minutes of being together, we were invaded by someone completely out-gearing us, and were killed extremely quickly. Super fun. So, if you want to play with a friend, you're also saying that all you want to do is PvP, because the invading interruptions will be pretty constant.I don't care if this was Dark Souls' core mechanic. This is Elden Ring. I was told it had co-op. I was not told I would also be forced to PvP if I choose to Co-Op. At least, not on the store page. Highly disappointed that I can't just enjoy the PvE experience of this game with my husband. Honestly can't believe the developers would force us into this situation. I'm not interested in the PvP at all. What a shame.",0
Negative,"The game is great, but at the same time, I'm tired of FromSoftware's common design flaws.Forced-on laggy PVP that basically makes online play a chore (it happens so often that it's basically a joke)Mobs scaling without a single visual differenceSome bosses are straight-up Dark Souls 2 mistakes ported to the gameIt's such a shame because the core game feels amazing, but there are so many stains on it that to me, it's basically dark souls 2. but with better control and a somewhat competent open world. The most frustrating aspect is that everything that could be great is here, but so much comes to ruin it for me that it's hard for me to actually recommend it.Either I play 100% offline and miss a good chunk of it, either I play it coop and it becomes a fully PVP game (which I absolutely despise when it's so abysmally poorly done, seriously, FromSoft has to do something about failing to make a stable multiplayer). Even worse, they adopted the Bloodborne system, which means that playing co-op basically guarantees PVP. Seriously, this is painful.I made a little experiment : I randomly decided to get coop 20 times at various, spaced-out times over the course of a few days, and I got invaded the 20 times without failing. This is lunatic.",0
Negative,"I've played online once because i needed a friend to help out with an area, and instantly got invaded. Who's shitty idea was it to not be able to opt out of invasions and just play with friends? do the Dev's really hate their fan base that much, that they need to punish new players to refund their money back? its a shitty game design, a shitty attitude towards new players, and completely outrageous. invasions should be disabled by nature until you've beaten the story, so that newcomers aren't punished for wanting to play with their friends. I've been gaming about 18 years (I'm well older than 18) and never have i come across a decent game that punishes like that. i cant seriously recommend this game to people who have friends until they do something about it.",0

Negative,"I DO NOT recommend this game to souls series fan.Completed this game with all questlines and canon ending.The most beautiful thing is visual art and graphics. That's all.Yes. No balance. No intresting world. No intresting questlines. No intresting lore. WORLD: Its just constructor from presets. Only the end locations have their own sharm in dungeons. No point of interests. You will fight to dragons for some piece of ingredients for craft you won't use whole game.BALANCE: It is a game full of magic and about magic so as you might think already: yes magic is OP. But sometimes the special of weapon may damage much more than just magic. But for increasing you damage you need magic stats again. 80% of all weapons are requiring winsdom, faith or sorcery. QUESTS: The characters not charming you they are empty and boring. Their questlines sometimes too easy and really good (hi rannie) but sometimes too complicated and boring.LORE: The lore is broken. I can't tell you all because of spoilers. But its broken and absolutely boring if we would compare to dark souls lore. This part just a parasite of the past of dark souls series.MULTIPLAYER: Imbalanced meta guys just flexing in their lobbies with 1-2 friends killing you and teabaging. No point to invade someone. There is no covenants and items you got. There is nothing.And finally. This game isn't hardcore. This game for boys and girls who wanna play some relaxing game. That's it. Only end game locations can challenge you a bit. But open world give you too much ways to bypass your enemies. You can kill the dragon staying on the cliff and shooting your magic. You can just to some statue to make the same. You can attack throgh the walls. it is making this game not fun at all because there is no challenge. All bosses are weak and easy.PEACE GUYS!",0
Negative,"If I were to describe Elden Ring in one sentence I would say:""It is a marvelous, grandiose, spectacular game with old, gaping, unforgivable flaws""You know whether you want to play it or not and this review is not bound to change your opinion.

I can not recommend a game, 50% of which I utterly detest.I have been playing and praising Dark Souls series for years and now it truly feels like I am done with From Software games. I don't think I will be returning to this title, checking out it's DLCs or looking forward to any new games From Software makes. With decisions they make it is clear FS chose to cater their products to a specific audience and I can not consider myself part of that audience anymore.",0
Negative,"Worst PVP in any From game, by a country mile. Has the potential to be better in every way, but instead is worse in most, which makes it worse.",0
Negative,"Let me start by saying that this game has moments where it truly is enjoyable. However, the game has far too many problems for me to truly recommend it. The side content is laughable at best, mainly consisting of dungeons randomly placed along the empty open world. These dungeons are no better as they practically look and feel the same, and at the end you get rewarded with either A. a random mob with a boss health-bar, or B. a rehash of a boss you've fought before. To keep the content from becoming ""too easy"" they resort to varying cheap methods from general health and damage buffs to simply just adding another copy of the boss.Luckily I can say that the main content in the game is marginally better with somewhat unique bosses and areas, which are more worth to explore than anything else in the game. However, even with marginally better and unique bosses, I really can't say it's amazing. The main issue I see is in their attempt to make the game ""harder"" such as large health-bar, and the player doing less damage. In another attempt to make it more difficult, they gave the bosses a million different bait attacks, such as unnaturally holding their attacks a few seconds, quick slaps that do little damage but are often incredibly difficult to see or read, punishing the player for even getting close. Best of all, some bosses have jump attacks where they just float in the air before suddenly slamming down. Granted these attacks can all be read and learned, but it makes for an incredibly tedious experience.",0
Negative,"I wanted to love this game. I really did. For the first 30 hours, I was enthralled. That being said, the game has a ruthless difficulty curve and forces ""exploration"" to a level of grind that was just not enjoyable. Psuedo-freedom is the name of the game. (Not to mention, the PC version of this game runs like absolute dog-water. Frame stutters, hard crashes, and more technical issues abound. I have a relatively high-end rig, and still faced issues.)Once past the beginning areas of the game and your first Demigod kill, the game opens up into it's world truly and fully. However, most areas are level locked without being explicit about it - you'll only know you've messed up when you tickle an enemy's health bar with your strongest move. Becoming one-shot by any enemy, including mobs becomes the norm, and with all enemies/bosses having relentless attack strings with frame perfect requirements for rebuttal you'll be in for one hell of a time. General Radahn is a quitting point for many, for a good reason.The game forces you to try and farm/level up in other areas - but also has pitiful drop rates for both runes(souls) and items. Difficult enemies may only yield 1k runes when you need 30k to level up once, and with the chance of losing all runes at any time (as soulsgames do) the punishment becomes severe. I finished the game out of pure spite and love for FromSoft games (mainly from my days on consoles) at level 164, after farming for hours of ""gameplay"" - but I still was one shot frequently by mid-late game bosses and mobs, even with heavy armor and high vigor.As for exploration, the world is colossal. But in a way, it is too big. The game just.keeps.going. It's long, and once you start to realize how empty and unrewarding exploration is, it becomes a beautiful pit of nothing. Exploring dungeons and areas may only yield in. 5 kukri knives and potentially some spirit summons you'll never use. It becomes expected, that around a corner or in a field there will be an encampment or group of enemies to kill. A grunt type, a captain type, and a caster. Different designs, but same results over, and over, and over again, with lackluster or downright laughable rewards, if any. The crafting system is novel, but I used it once my entire playthrough. And with the loot table having crafting items take up space, it becomes more annoying then anything else.Soulsbornes strength's, in my opinion, come from being able to do multiple runs with different builds and playthroughs. Elden Ring is geared heavily toward a one-and-done approach, and speedrunning / SL1 builds may be downright impossible. I finished the story once, and have zero desire to ever touch the game again.While the scope and goal of Elden Ring was admirable, it's execution ultimately left a poor taste in my mouth. I would recommend the game to those who are diehard fans of the Developer's games, and can look aside the sheer grind it forces you to commit to. To everyone else, I wouldn't waste your time.",0
Negative,"6.5/10Open World made this game so much worse. Big open maps always give incentive to content vomit all over the place and since there is not enough time to develop, it will always be copy-pasted encounters, re-used bosses & enemies. Dungeons are even worse, they make procedurally generated Chalice Dungeons from Bloodborne feel like a hand-crafted masterpieces. Horseback combat is as boring as it is bare-bones to a point where you have to wonder why is it even in the game. The answer is its another casualty of the open world approach.Combat is just DS3, feels like no lessons were learnt from either Bloodborne or Sekiro. Same old stuff roll, block, swing your weapon of choice from left to right once, rinse and repeat. Meanwhile bosses progressed so much since DS1, they have all kinds of combos and conditional attack patterns, cool designs and insane mobility comparing to older games, makes you feel like they come from a different, much better game. Overall combat is extremely primitive and you almost always have nothing to do mechanically (which again is simply DS3, dunno about you but I had enough of that already). Learning attack patterns is also boring, which previously wasn't the case, but that is mostly related to the first problem I outlined too many enemies with minimal visual and mechanical variations, it doesn't feel distinct enough.Progression is extremely less interesting then any other games in the series (especially less then Bloodborne). Previous games had a lot of shortcuts and were designed as a complex maze you navigate to unlock the puzzle, each layer of the puzzle is its own maze to solve. Each layer tells (with varying levels of effectiveness) its own story by the way it looks and feels. Every layer adds to the previous one and by the end you have a complete picture. In Elden Ring there is nothing of this sort. World feels artificial (almost to an MMO-level), weird and non-functional but not in an interesting way. Instead of making you wonder what kind of calamity brought this place to its current state you have to wonder if ever worked at all.Overall its a disappointment for me, especially given the hype and all the spin-off experiments by From Software being so much better.NB: not even gonna mention the bad port, its part of the course these days.

Negative,"NEVER GOT EATEN BY CHEST MONSTER WORST GAME EVER.Since it's been a bit longer, I'll give a more full review. Still hitting it with a negative.One of the main things from Souls has always been boss design, and one of the largest draws of players has been the high skill caps and requirements to avoid mechanics. Elden Ring seems to have taken a complete 180 from this with boss design. You feel forced to avoid interacting with the boss in any way you can think of. The bosses feel contrived in the way they push the player to use systems other than just their own personal skill. Niall is probably the best example of this. Ignoring the adds teleporting through the fog wall to kill you, the fight is basically just running away and hoping to seperate the adds enough to kill them one at a time and praying the boss doesn't lunge stab you in the back at the wrong time.God Eating Serpent is just a worse version of Yhorm.Malenia could have been cool if she didn't have a nearly unavoidable first 6 slashes for her jump (Run away or get hit), or if her triple slash didn't garuntee a roll catch if you don't roll through her. Maliketh and Mohg, Margit, Morgott, Godfrey and Godrick. Placidusax. These are the bosses that show what Souls Games were about, their designs are superb, above and beyond what other games had. Every other bosses has flaws and gimmicks to them that cause them to be endlessly obnoxious in ways that just make you want to do as much as possible to even avoid them doing anything other than walking towards you. Or in the case of Fire Giant, rolling away endlessly, never letting you even get close to him. The fact this is the first time I can without a doubt say I hate most of the bosses is honestly disappointing, and why I'm giving a negative review.Though there are the stupid shrimp people that never stop shooting at you. and the birds.Outside of bosses however, Elden Ring has taken quite literally everything good about souls games, as well as a whole lot of the bad, and just made it better.Ashes of War.Unique Weapons.Huge exploration, hidden stuff all over.Story is a bit more cohesive and understandable.Who the hell is Radagon?I truly wish the boss design wasn't such a 180 and departure from previous titles.Big DOES NOT EQUAL Good.It usually just makes the fight annoying.",0
Negative,"- Regardless of graphics settings, the game runs at an inconsistent 50 fps while outdoors with the occasional stutter. Button inputs will occasionally get eaten due to this.- The game can randomly crash, and may consistently crash in certain locations.- Game throws a fit when closing and will persist as active on Steam indefinitely until you forcefully close Steam.- The camera will always follow your character to some extent. While locked onto a target, the game will attempt to keep it in the top center of your screen at all times. This can completely impair your ability to see when dealing with large, flying, or fast enemies, and especially so in tight corridors or next to a tall object or wall.- Due to the restrictive nature of the camera, you'll also have a hard time keeping your bearings straight, often getting ambushed by off-screen enemies, pinning yourself against a wall, or simply rolling off a cliff.- Camera movement feels off when using a mouse because the automatic camera adjustments still apply.- Because jumping and attacking are two separate actions, performing a jump attack follows whichever direction your character was moving in at the time of execution, rather than towards your target like an ordinary attack would.- Hit collision for attacks will occasionally feel off. Attacks that either should or shouldn't have hit will have the opposite outcome. Jump attacks will notoriously miss, instead causing your character to glide against the target like water on a balloon.- The outdoor world is poorly designed for combat. It's easy for both you and enemies to get stuck on rocks and other various objects, while trees will constantly block your view and screw with the camera collision.- Sprint and dodge rolling are tied to the same button. A quick press rolls, whereas holding down sprints. Framerate dips or input lag while sprinting may cause you to roll. Also being bound to the same button means in order to transition from sprinting to rolling, you must release the button first, adding a multi-frame delay that can often lead to your demise.- Every action must be bound, which means every button on the controller must be used. This includes pushing both sticks in.- Controllers can't use triggers as key modifiers, meaning all 14 bindable actions must be bound to your 14 available buttons.- Whatever you bind your ""Interact"" button to is also the modifier for your extra item slots.- Keyboards can't bind actions to function keys.- None of the menus can be bound, and none of the in-menu keybinds can be rebound.",0
Negative,"From a game design perspective, Elden Ring is a masterpiece. From a technical perspective, the game's performance is inexcusable. Sure you can muddle along and change settings and tweak things and just live with the stutters and low fps. I'm doing that and still having a good time, and I'm sure many other people are doing that too. But asking your players to jump through that many hoops just to have a ""playable"" experience is unacceptable in this day and age. Until the performance gets improved in a major way, this review is going to stay negative.UPDATE:I decided to update this review since the Shadow of the Erdtree DLC dropped.and it's not much better. The technical limitations of this game have not improved in the years since the game launched. Is the game still worth playing? Sure, at least for me it is. But I shouldn't have to resort to playing this game on Linux to get good-ish performance. Like I said before, that's way too many hoops to jump through. This is an excellent game being tarnished for PC players.",0
Negative,"if you like other darksouls/bloodborne/sekiro titles this is more of that but in a open world but that also comes with some negatives.the map is jsut bad. it does dont really show anything besides a main plot and a lot of important stuff can just be hidden away in a random corner for u to find, and the problem is if u dont find it u will just never have the item. same with important npcs taht cna be killed requiring hours of work to get them back with no guidance this in turn is making the game quite annoying and requires 3rd party maps or sites and a notebook to remember the quests and areas u visited just to get the most out of the game.",0
Negative,"this game is fantasic, everything about it is amazing. however the game has constant crashes and frame dips. honestly wouldn't be that bad if it werent for the fact i have to open task manager everytime it freezes because it wont close otherwise.",0
Negative,"Fix the game, From Software. There is no reason why this game should be this buggy. It's pretty obvious this is a PS4/Xbone game ported to ""later-gen"" hardware, and they did a terrible job. I like this game a lot, but I cannot give an honest review until they fix these glaring issues.",0
Negative,"As much as I love the entire souls franchise I can't in good conscience recommend this game at this point, there are currently far too many issues with framerate drops and stuttering that for many of us make this game essentially unplayable in it's current state. Would highly recommend waiting for a good while until all the kinks have been patched out, and god knows how long that will take. My advice: wait for an eventual steam sale. Definitely don't pay full price for this game in it's current state.",0
Negative,"I have only ever played one other Dark Souls game for pc. I'm not even sure which one it was so long ago. This is not a pc game, this is a console port. That should say all you need if you were interested in mouse and keyboard controls.Thankfully you can actually customize the keybinds in this game but that won't do you any good for the menus. All the menus and hints show Xbox controls layout. The default key binds are strange to say the least with spacebar being used to dodge and jump being on a different key. I forget the default but it was like X or C to jump.I was looking for a nice action rpg but this was just a disappointment. The way the character and camera interact together is a big turn off for me. Not being a fan of the Dark Souls series doesn't help either. The tutorial isn't the greatest for someone like myself that hasn't played previous titles. Also messages I thought were part of the tutorial may have been left by players or at least I am guessing they were. It was another mechanic not explained at all.I don't recommend this game unless you are a huge fan of dark souls series AND you intend to play it using a controller.",0
Negative,"Is the game good? Yes, it's more than good. It's amazing, really. Do I recommend buying it right now? No. Let me just say this as a massive Soulslike fan: the optimization on this is horrible. I played almost every other fromsoft game on consoles, so it was really jarring to me to see something this janky. It doesn't matter if you're barely grazing the minimum requirements or if you're curbstomping the recommended settings on maximum graphics, you'll *always* get horrible framedrops. At first, it'll be just annoying and it won't hamper too much of the gameplay. Then it'll start literally killing you in the game. There are boss fights that are especially bad because of the framedrops. If you own a console, play it there. Not on PC.",0
Negative,Good Game.But missing uwqhd-Support in 2020? Plz.,0
Negative,"TERRIBLE PC port. The game is capped at 60 fps, includes lots of screen tearing, camera's movement feels awful, and unplayable with mouse and keyboard.",0
Negative,"The game is everything you know and love from Soulsborne games but at the moment I can't recommend-the PC port is atrocious. I can't even play on the lowest settings without stutters and frame drops (I'd be bummed even IF this wasn't a game that requires split-second, frame-perfect reactions). WAIT to buy this. It will be the masterpiece I've heard it is some day.but not right now, and not on PC.",0
Negative,"The amount of time you'll spend trying to fix all the problems and bugs that this game offers will put you out of refund range (2 hours > no refund) and leave you with 60 dollars less in your wallet and a broken game you can't play.In my case, the recent patch only made the game perform worse and fixed nothing. This game is just going to lay there in my Steam library until they fix the hot mess they've spitballed and called a PC Port. Terrible release all around.",0
Negative,"I'm Sorry FromSoftware, But I have to.Gameplay is amazing and developed in many way aside from ds3, takes a lot of inspiration from Sekiro and Bloodborne, but damn those stutters. Idk if it play worse than DKS1, my eyes bleed from the stutter and my head hurts from playing it. It's the main freaking reason I play on PC. I will change my review when the game is patched properly for pc. Port is Just Plain bad.",0
Negative,"Great game, awful PC port. Seriously, after over 30 hours of play I'm amazed by the game but equally amazed by how shitty From Software is about optimizing their game engine. I'm keeping this review negative until they fix their shader caching issue that causes stuttering even on high end hardware. When that is fixed and the game can hold a steady 60fps then I will recommend it.",0
Negative,"Without a gamepad the menu is nearly impossible to navigate and gamepad control hints still pop up, just like in previous bad ports of dark souls games.The character movement plays like a bad port as well, unless you're autolocking on an enemy (the need for which implies bad gameplay in my book) there's no strafing just full body turning with the camera pointed in the same direction and terrain navigation is clunky (on top of the random lag spikes).Thought they'd refined this for PC, but really it's just a bad port of a playstation game. Really wanted to like this game.Refunded.",0
Negative,"I tried to love this game. I was excited for its release. There was a lot of hype up to this game and I cant believe it has received such glowing reviews even this early. The frame stuttering is crazy for a game this new. It makes the game near unplayable. I tried for 6 hours hoping I could get past the issues and be satisfied for another company to release a game that wasn't well put together. I truly believe this could be a decent game, but the polish isn't there at the least. The cooperative play is another issue altogether for me. As I stated I genuinely tried this game and gave it some time. I wanted to play this game with my friend, but I was sorely disappointed. When you're able to join or host a game long enough to play any the issues get worse. Enemies shooting across the map, dying for one player and not the other, enemies or friends freezing in place or breaking their animations. Those are the problems that I don't believe are intentional for this game; things that can possibly be fixed. What can't be fixed however is the way the cooperative play is designed in general. You have to craft an item to play co-op. Funky, but I was willing to roll with it. Then when one player dies the connection is broken and the joined player is sent back to where they were in their own game before joining resulting in the host and joining player having to re craft and remake the co-op game. You cant traverse the entire world together or fight all the bosses together. IF YOU""RE BUYING THIS GAME PURELY FOR THE JOY OF PLAYING DARK-SOULS WITH YOUR FRIEND THEN DO NOT BUY! Co-op is not co-op in this game and you'll find yourself frustrated and disappointed before you get a handful of hours into playing the game. It's something I wish I would've paid attention to as soon as I started playing multiplayer in the game, but I wanted to love it and I wanted to convince myself it was worth sixty dollars. Now I just hope Steam refunds me so I can spend money on a game that is finished, polished and true to what it says it is.",0
Negative,Was fun and cool until I got locked behind an infinite load screen that pops up every time I try to continue my save. Unplayable at the moment. Waiting for them to fix this before I change to a positive review.,0
Negative,"While I do not want to give this game a negative review, for the time being, I have to.The game itself is challenging and a lot of fun. I don't have any complaints about the solo game at all.With that said, we chose to pre-purchase this game for every member of my household because we have long been looking for a cooperative multiplayer CRPG, which is what the Steam page here and every ad and article we read on this game promised. It turns out, however, that this is NOT a cooperative multiplayer CRPG. It is, rather, a cooperative multiplayer PVP game. That is, you can ONLY play cooperative multiplayer IF you play PVP. Mind you, I don't mind playing PVP sometimes, but it isn't something I want to do all of the time, and especially not when I am playing with my family trying to overcome certain difficult mobs. So until the devs fix this obviously flawed system, I cannot recommend this game. Especially since none of this information was stated on the official website or on the Steam page when I pre-purchased four copies of it!",0
Negative,"This game is truly amazing. Elden Ring is a masterpiece, literal instant classic if only taking into account the gameplay-aspects. However, this port has some technical issues, which is saddening. see below:currently, the port is a hot #!$&%"" % mess. but the update from 26/02/22 improved ingame performance already -> game looks great on high with an rx480 (8gb) and nearly manages to maintain 60fps steadily. but the slowdowns are still there and they're not your average framedrop, instead the entire gameworld slows down. this can ruin your entire day in dangerous combat situations. losing in a souls-like due to one's own incompetence is one thing but losing due to poor programming and insufficient consideration of different platforms computing infrastructure by the devs is unacceptable. please fix your otherwise great game, so pc-players can enjoy it to it's fully potential!thanks for coming to my TEDtalk",0
Negative,"A key requirement for me was that this was a coop game. But it is not a true coop game, it is a single player game that makes you jump through hoops (crafting items, being in the right place on their map etc) to invite a friend to come and help you out with a bit of your quest. The friend does not gain progress in their quest by helping you. The friend must stay within a level range of you. If the friend dies they are kicked from your game. You can only invite 2 additional players, not 3 as some of the early media releases suggested. Apparently, this was a ""feature"" of earlier games from this developer. Certainly my last look at them.",0
Negative,"The game itself is excellent so far. The addition of a jump button and mount failed to trivialize combat, and instead offers superior exploration and combat options. Enemy variety is strong, with a fundamentally new encounter type in mounted enemies that come in for an attack and then move back out of reach, and the bosses are both fair and complex enough to challenge series veterans. The addition of posture breaks for all enemies is an excellent addition, the child of Sekiro and BB, and rewards players for mastering a fight beyond a simple, defensive playstyle. The review is negative because the performance is simply not acceptable. I run an i9, 2080, and 64 gigs of ram. I completely obliterate the recommended specs, let alone the minimum, and I still see consistent but minor stuttering in certain areas/encounters, that's how poorly optimized it is. Even though it runs acceptably for me, it clearly doesn't for a ton of people, and thus I can't recommend the game because you're not going to enjoy it if it's yo-yoing between 30 and 50 fps and you're getting killed because you literally can't react to what's happening.Update after further experience:The performance issues persist throughout the game even after multiple patches. I have now also begun to experience the occasional crash.The gameplay is outstanding. The PvP and NPC questlines are the typical shameful mess, but the lore, enemy encounters, and level design are consistently of a very high quality.Update after 300 hours:Nope, the performance issues still aren't fixed!Great game though. Easily the best exploration out of any FROM game, and the best of the bosses stand on par with stuff like Ludwig, OOK, Gael, etc. The legacy dungeons are also nearly to a man outstanding traditional FROM levels.",0
Negative,Preformance on a high end system with a 3080TI and pretty new ryzen processor is horrible. Wait a few months and buy it on sale.,0
Negative,"""Inappropriate Activity Detected""",0
Negative,I have played Elden Ring enough to see the major issues. I believe one of the issues you have that keeps this game from becoming a AAA great hit is the issue with FPS the second is PC key mapping. These limitations are the kind of game play issues that keeps people from even getting into the story and the open world combat that makes this game special. I know if these issues are fixed and implemented this game would quickly become the hit of the year. For the reasons above I have to give it a recommendation of NO.,0

Negative,"- optimization on PC is bad (recommended is 1070? what can people play with 1070, I have a 3070 Ti and it stutters)- almost zero quality of life, I'm not talking about making combat easier, it's fun this way. But this game is less than half of what Zelda BOTW has in terms of implicit ""guidance"" - if something is basically required to progress, please just hint us to it, how am I supposed to know to turn around and visit a place at night to trigger a progression?- bugs, bloodstain doesn't work, multi-play is choppyI guess after 2020 we just can't have a ""finished"" game at launch huh.",0
Negative,"Please buy this game, I know this is a negative review but genuinely this game IS AMAZING. if. you can get past a few barriers, the usual that everyone else lists. Among this, note: This game does use assets from ds3 in a lot of areas, trees, ground, etc. THIS GAME has BUILT IN DELAY currently in the pc port from what I know. Until this delay is fixed quite simply this game is in an unplayable state.",0
Negative,"Let's see. a lot of stuttering, even on medium settings. and i have an RTX 3090. You are forced to play with a controller. You can't play with mouse and keyboard well. mouse sensitivity is too high and you can't adjust it, all the notices are showing you controller keys ( Y, A, X, B) instead of the keyboard keys assigned to that control.The game is stuttering even in the menu.The menu is bad. the UI is bad. to navigate through the menu, you have to right click and select back instead of ESC key. Even the simpler things are not implemented in this game. I don't know why a 2022 triple AAA game was so hyped and praised by reviewers when is this bad.You are going to cry because of how bad the game and ui is and how bad it runs. not because of how many times you die.",0
Negative,"I hate giving this game a thumbs down, but they need to really focus on their PC version and fix the lag and stuttering issues. However; I'm a huge fan of FromSoftware and all of their souls games.Is Elden Ring fun? Yes. Do I actually enjoy it? I do. However; FPS are horrible, and there are periodic moments you get bad lag and stuttering which happens, of course, during combat. With this being a triple A studio. I expect more, especially since there are indie developers out there doing better in this area.Also, the player messages are just obnoxious, and I really wish there was an option to turn them off. Not because of what the messages say, but visually. they're everywhere. You enter a zone and there's, literally, 20 glowing messages cluttered around the terrain. It really takes away the immersion of the game.Ultimately, I'm giving this game a thumbs down due to its horrible performance on PC. If it gets patched/fixed, I'll consider changing my recommendation.",0
Negative,"Edit: Turns out I was right, thankfully. From Software recognizes that the game isn't finished and has now started patching the game. Ashes of war have been balanced, (a few) quest lines have been finished and they nerfed Radahn. I expect to see a lot more tweaks in the future and then this review will be positive.As much as I want to enjoy this game I do not like it in its current state. Keep in mind that as you read this review I could easily enjoy the game if a couple tweaks are added to make it different. Also, this review mostly mentions flaws with the game as I want to bring more attention to the flaws which people are mostly ignoring. This is meant to be constructive criticism, not a rage post, I love challenge and this game is decent: 7-8/10. First of all, over a week since the game has been released a lot of the glitches have yet to be fixed and performance is still awful for a lot of players. I had to beat the game with a constant 45-55 fps despite having the proper specs to run the game.The biggest flaw of the actual gameplay I would have to say is either the lack of innovation or the boss roster. I'll start with the boss roster: Never in any of the souls games have I seen so many complaints from the community of bosses being either too unfair, boring, too easy or that it has a stupid mechanic. I think a couple years from now when people make rankings containing their favorite bosses from From Software very few of the top ones will be from Elden Ring. Even the good fights like Malenia and Maliketh are ruined by this game's damage issue. The only boss in this game that I thought had decent design was Mohg, with Margit being an honorable mention. Aside from those 2 the bosses were mostly boring.I would like to squeeze in a little extra complaint about damage here, in the game's current state you are almost required to level your vigor up to 60+ if you don't want to get one shot but even then there are bosses that can kill you in one hit. People come with the lazy argument that you can't complain about taking too much damage if you don't level vigor, but never in any of the souls games have I felt *required* to level vigor. The build I was going for initially was not meant to have much vigor but after boss fights ending instantly if I make a tiny little mistake I clearly had to change that.To put this into perspective: In Dark Souls and Bloodborne I would usually die from running out of heals, or at least being low on healing. In Elden Ring I die with 10 flask remaining to a single hit I didn't quite dodge on time.Now, for the lack of innovation this point is quite simple, while the game has good content, as someone who has played most souls games it is just more of the same. This point varies a lot between different people, it all depends on how you read the phrase: ""Dark souls but open world"". To me the game should have done something new, as dark souls 3 was meant to be the end of the DS franchise. Even Bloodborne added teeny tiny little differences that still made the game feel very refreshing but Elden Ring did not try at all. The only additions were weirdly powerful weapon abilities that you end up spamming, a jump attack that just makes normal charged attack obsolete, unnecessary counter system and lastly horseback combat that is very rough. What I wanted to see was something we haven't seen before rather than a compilation of everything From Software has done up until this point because this game failed at being that as well. A tiny issue I have with the game is as an ""avid open-world gamer"" (sounds really cringe I know) this game is kind of tiny. At times it can feel huge and the amount of content in the world is definitely enough, the fact is that the game is roughly 40km . If you compare that to BOTW or RDR2 which are 75km , or The Witcher 3 which is 135km the game could definitely have been a little bigger for my tastes.I am a huge lore nerd when it comes to the souls series and this game was absurdly disappointing. I can summarize the issue by simply comparing two sentences below:""Dark souls is about an age of fire that eventually fades, causing people to rise from their graves, now it is the players choice if they want to follow the orders of the royal family or seek an alternate path.""Elden Ring is about an age of the erdtree/elden ring that eventually breaks, causing people to rise from their graves, now it is the players choice if they want to follow the orders of the Golden Order or seek an alternate path.""That is right, Elden Ring is just Dark souls but with different names pretty much. Even the way the world is built is very similar. If you watch Vatiividyas latest video he even mentions several times that parts of the lore are similar to Dark Souls. This could be a plus or minus depending on what you think but considering Bloodborne has the greatest story From Software has made, Elden Ring was definitely lost potential.Something that dissapointed me quite a lot is that quests are kind of lacking. Don't get me wrong I loved Ranni's quest but there are a couple issues with it. In this big world completing quests is like finding a needle in a haystack so 90% of players use the internet to progress through quests, although it has always been this way now it is worse than ever. I realize that quests are meant to be obscure but I don't entirely agree with the design. Another issue with quests is the lack of dialogue this time around. The stories are often seen as inconclusive as characters have a little less than 1-3 minutes of total dialogue. For example Melina, your guide in this game, has very little dialogue throughout the entire game and when she eventually leaves you it is meant to be sad but it falls flat as she has barely been present throughout the journey.The soundtrack this time around is also not quite enough. I ask you to name a banger from the OST that isn't tree sentinel or the title screen. Both of those themes are okay but nothing compared to what From Soft has achieved in the past. Another issue with the OST is that a lot of songs are repeated and very few original tracks stand out. I love orchestral music and I listen to From Soft music a lot but this time around the OST feels very. cheap? A little too short, feels samey and no real ""bangers"".I think the game should have gotten a little more time in the oven as most of the issues I mentioned are simply things that could be tweaked (like damage) or fleshed out (like quests).",0
Negative,"PC is more than capable of running the game, i'm actually not even having much an issue w/ the stuttering although it does occur here and there but what drives me insane is after 4 minutes of playing after each time loading in the enemies become invisible.

Negative,"The PC port is rough. Prompts are with Xbox buttons by default even with mouse/keyboard, so you don't know buttons mappings when you start.

AND it will say ""Framerate unsuitable for online play"" sometimes when you try to start it up, not letting you past the main menu (I have a 3080 and strong cpu - seems it may be going of my motherboard graphics somehow).I'm sure the game is fun IF you can play it.",0

Negative,"While I massively enjoy the game, and personally find it to be potentially one of the best games of the past decade. There's some issues.

I'm running the game on a GTX 3060 Ti, and while the game is running great most of the time, when I REALLY need it to run perfectly, it doesn't leading to constant deaths. The gae world looks phenomenal but what's the point in caring about how pretty this game is when I'm running off cliffs, being combo'd to death and dying to a boss on the final stretch due to frame stutter?

Not to mention even in these rare cases the game just stutter like crazy in specific points or even when you approach certain enemies.On top of that the graphics settings are bare bones, no ray tracing, no dlss, no new technology.With the incredible marketing they did for this game I thought they would care more for the pc port, but as usual when it comes to japanese developers pc always get the short end of the stick.Honestly one of the worst optimized games I've ever played, very disappointed.Hope they fix these problems ASAP",0

Negative,"COOP WARNING! If you kill all the bosses considered by devs as ""main"" bosses for this region you will be locked out of coop for the whole region.

In my case I can remember only 2 times when I was host during invasion and I got crashed and i got mine disabled.Coop is barely playable. Disconnects, crashes, stutters.Also no horse in coop meaning you will spent lot's of time just slowly traversing empty open world.

Negative,"Runs like absolute dog dookie. My system is well above minimal requirements needed to play, yet there is severe lag and frame dropping even on minimal settings when I attempt to play the game. Launching game (even in offline mode) tells me that I dont have enough FPS to play online and I get kicked to the start menu, which got me in a perpetual death loop where I click the start button and it kicks me right back to the menu again. Once I made it past that hurdle (changing settings to lowest graphical to try to improve frames, setting it to start in offline mode, and making the UI give control hints for keyboard and mouse because for some reason it was set to controller by default?) I finally loaded into the game! My save file has less than 7 minutes, as I tried to lag my way across the room while ominous black squares flashed/strobed/conga lined across my entire vision.

Negative,Huge problem with end game invaders when playing with friends. Make game entirely unplayable in coop. You're guranteed to be invaded by low level players with end game gear and they will gatekeep the game. There are literal swarms of players who sit at the beginning of the game simply to prevent new players from playing. Playing solo is fine until you try to play the game any longer than the intro. Twinks are a CONSTANT problem. Constant FPS drops are a damaging problem and it gets even worse when the game spawns enemies or if you explore the world. It struggles to load in anything without making your game stutter. Playing this is a constant struggle to try and have fun. Not to mention the inability to even play the game due to the black screen bug that hasn't been fixed yet.,0

Negative,"Too good, made me lose my job. 10/10, would play again.",0
Negative,"Solid 6/10 game that brings nothing truly new to the Action-RPG genre.This is a hard do not recommend, especially with the game being a solid 6/10 and that I really enjoy it.If steam had a neutral option I would be using that instead.I love exploring, I love the combat from Bloodborne/Dark Souls 3, this has good aspects from both of those games for combat, and the open world is pretty good, albeit tedious to explore and die in a boring loop.Sound design is pretty damn great, graphics are middling at best, optimization is shit (which is to be expected, Japanese devs seemingly don't use PC hardware for stability testing when developing games- somehow).I might change this to recommend later once the rough edges are ironed out, but for now you can sleep on this game, you're not going to miss out on anything unless you really really need more Soulsborne-like combat in your life currently.Update:Steam says I should review my review since I've played another 75 hours.Basically still a solid 6/10 that I wouldn't recommend to most people who don't absolutely love action games.I am enjoying my experience overall, but I can tell that people new to this style of combat would probably get bored or result to using guides/meta builds for their first playthrough.Update 2:Up to 150-160ish some hours first playthrough still.Basically all dungeons and bosses, that I have access to, cleared so far. Now that I've got more time to dedicate to completing the game- I've been having an okay time of it.In typical fashion I have kneecapped myself for most of my playthrough using as many talisman slots as possible to make things difficult for me. (Take more damage, only going for counterhits or crits, using max equipment load for best poise at medium load, requiring max buffs without greater runes to barely beat bosses, online disabled.)Having fun though.Getting 1 and 2 shot by most enemies is good times.Let alone bosses which will 1 shot me every time.I still can't recommend this game to newcomers. It's a 20 dollar product, as is- currently with no DLC, selling way over the mark. Bloodborne and Souls 3 are arguably more difficult games with more fleshed out experiences. The one thing Elden Ring has over those games is variety of combat approaches, that's it, many of which are not effective, nothing else really to be said about this game, it's slightly above average for an action RPG by Fromsoft.",0

Negative,I can't believe that a game released in 2022 for PC doesn't support Ultrawide. I thought at first it was just the character building screen and movies.

Negative,"Surprised to see the game run so bad on a R9 3900X/RTX3080 system. Lots of hiccups, stutter and crashing. In the times it was playable I tried running this game in coop with friends and its a huge burden to get your friends in the same game with you. Should be a lot easier than it is without having to find fingers, brew up potions and even after that it just wasn't reliably working. Also I beat a couple bosses and got awards that disappeared and never showed up in my inventory.",0
Negative,"Elden Ring is a very solid 7.5 out of 10 open-world game. The only reason I'm not going to recommend it is because I think too many people are letting their bias or love for Soulsbourne games cloud their judgement.You've probably heard all the pros of this game already. The open world atmosphere, the Darks Souls difficulty, the customization of each playthrough, etc. So instead, I'll focus on the cons now that I've beat the game and have explored the whole map with all possible side bosses.CONS:- Framerate continues to be a problem on PC with semi-frequent frame dips- Locked to 60fps- All major bosses fight with high aggression, be prepared to match that energy- Bosses are recycled: Crucible Knights, Knights Calvary, Tree Sentinels, Ulcerated Tree Spirit, Gargoyles, Dragons, Godskin Duo, Erdtree Avatar, Trolls, and Golems will repeat in every new area you travel to.- There are only 9 unique bosses (that have a cutscene and are part of the storyline) but only two need to be defeated to challenge the final boss- Minor enemies are also re-occuring with soldiers and knights being the most prominent in the overworld, just expect higher health pools and increase damage output as you arrive in newer areas- Although I didn't have many chances to use it, Multiplayer from what I experienced, sucks. Frequently disconnecting and very limited playing areas, even in the open world space- The story-telling is fragmented at best, it's a giant puzzle of lore that you must piece together. If you just play the game and only listen to the cinematics before/after bosses, the world will remain as quite the mystery- The game strongly favors Dexterity or Magic builds (mainly due to the aggressive nature of the bosses) also many of the best weapons require dexterity (especially bleed weapons)A SOLID 7.5 out of 10",0
Negative,"New Edit : Why in the fuck is FromSofts quest management/story progression somehow worse in SOTE? How is it possible to write all these little branching, overlapping quests for Miquellas knights and then you can just fuck them all up just by riding around looking for things?Dumb as hell. Edit - I guess this review turned into a meme.I'm not doing this for engagement; I genuinely didn't think anyone would give a shit about my dumb little opinions about a game that objectively has some terrible design decisions and _documented_ issues with microstuttering across varied hardware - Go equip the lag torch and enjoy that for yourself. Personally I think its kinda messed up that you assume have some agenda beyond ""I played this, but idk If I'd describe it as fun"" The game has issues. some of them (#3) have been patched since I wrote this. Some of the most annoying ones were patched before I wrote this (map markers). That's it for edits. Check out my soundcloud, I guess?-Seems kinda nuts to be posting a negative review with 700 hours in, right? hear me out : Ive sunk all this time into it like its a job. Im putting in work to get what I want out of it. and yeah, its work. most of the time though? Its a chore. and chores arent _fun_.This is just not a great AAA game. at all. It has legions of very defensive fanboys, but underneath all the cruft, here's whats going on; an absolute sea of poor design choices, inexplicable laziness, and inherited evils.1. The user experience and user interface design is really bad. trying to remount your horse after they died, mid fight? ER steals focus from the menu and makes you manually confirm that you want to use a flask to do it. every time. there's no way to turn this off. 2. Quests dont have a tracker, there's no way to look up what yuou were doing : playing the game blind is near impossible - I hope you like alt-tabbing to Fextralife because you're gonna be doing that a LOT.3. Quit the game? enjoy waiting 3 minutes before it dumps you to the title screen, makes you reconnect to the game server, cancel out of the ""information panel"" before you can actually quit to desktop. its 2022 and we're playing console port interfaces like its the year 2000. 4. A door has opened somewhere. Cool. Cool I know. oh I have to hit a specific key to make that message go away? and not hitting that key will lock me out of rolling and dodging till it happens. cool. That's well thought out.5. upgrade & inventory mechanics are a chore. somber smithing stones and regular ones behave differently, but all the smithing stones, gloveworts and golden runes are just labelled golden rune (1) through golden rune (13) - There's no indication of how many runes you get from each one. Regular smithing stones are consumed at varying rates to upgrade gear. its very lazy to actually name items this way in the front end - Erdtree favor +2 is literally called that. not ""greater erdtree favor"" or something. 6. The games most played ending : Age of Stars, is translated really badly. like, the meaning of age of stars is significantly different in japanese than it is in english. Why? Sloppy work.7. Optimization is trash. Enjoy stutters for no reason. Graphics on max? On min? doesnt matter. Middle of a bossfight? maybe. turning a corner going down some stairs with minimal load on the game engine? sure, why not. Stuttering isnt a graphical issue as the game drops input during these moments - Its either ER's absolutely terrible trash collection, or something even more stupid, like the engine hanging while waiting for telemetry data from the server. Make sure you equip Sentrys Torch and brace for the inexplicable lagging : because they designed the torch to basically attack with a travelling AOE every tick and the call-response for the torches mechanic lags the game engine. Peak coding, guys. Great work.8. Asset recycle. Radahns, Godricks, the Haligtree, Leyndell etc all reuse the same basic models AI and worse, loadouts for their soldiers with a reskin. They couldnt even be bothered to give the soldiers different loadouts depending on which armies they fought for. This intense laziness is everywhere, with most mobs being reused as minor bosses in dungeons (cleanrot knights, duelists etc) but even major bosses are duplicated Astel, Margit, Mohg - again with no changes to their loadouts or behaviour. Oh look, Anastasia, Tarnished-eater is back again for the third time.9. Camera control during large fights. is the elden beast doing that super annoying star rain attack? is Placidusax about to step on me? good luck finding out. You can either see what you're doing or attack large bosses. Not both. None of the above are critical, but these are just a taste of the abandonment of good design that ER has to offer you. They add up over time to the point where you don't want to grind out the last few endings because they add up into a wall of tiresome. a death by a thousand, annoying stupid decisions. Put it like this : Map markers were patched in after launch. someone literally, _after launch_ had to admit that a feature from any civilized game launched in the last 20 years might be a good idea to have. If you havent already bought it, Get it on sale. wait however long it takes.",0
Negative,"Not for me.Beautiful looking game, amazing lore.Shit gameplay on mouse and keyboard, annoying bosses with asspull moves that remove the element of skill in favor of pattern recognition over hours of fighting the same boss (looking at you Margit).The game doesn't give you a sense of direction and you have no idea what you're supposed to do.It got boring way too early, and very annoying at times. I should have watched a walkthrough before buying, now I just wish I didn't waste my money on it.",0
Negative,"I only had this game briefly, so keep that in mind.Having said that, I was literally driven off by how actively hostile the controls are for PC players on mouse and keyboard. In theory, I imagine its possible to actually remap the controls to something that makes sense, but when the menu system assumes I've got a gamepad controller makes it almost impossible. C'mon, you can literally detect what devices I've got connected to my PC, and despite that, its telling me to hit a button on a gamepad that doesn't exist to confirm keybind changes.After about fifteen minutes, and a couple Google searches on what the hell to do, I realized that I shouldn't have to be doing this to *start* a game.

He is exactly right. This game offers absolutely nothing different from those games. It's what it says on the tin. Its just open world dark souls. Still barely a story. Still some random lore they expect you to care about, or even find for that matter. If you dont like the punishing combat of souls games, thats all this is really. If you ask for help or suggestions in anyway to make the game playable, the player base will flame you and tell you to git gud. Not very welcoming.NOT RECOMMENDED.",0

Negative,im just bad at the game,0
Negative,"So a few things here. I would love to give this game a good review, but as it stands I simply can't. Lets start with the gameplay and the content itself. Is it a good game? Yes, very much so. Its tough, fun and actually makes you think about what you are doing on your first few playthroughs. The scenery and scale of the game and the locations in this game look fantastic and feel fantastic. The combat is good, definitely a good deal less clunky than previous From Software games. Parries have been made all but redundant with the sheer amount of spells and weapon skills in the game. However this is both a plus and a minus. The spells and weapon skills can make you feel like an absolute god, but at the same time make the game feel much easier. Skill almost becomes a non-factor in both pvp and pve when there are spells that do all the work for you. Horse combat is an absolute bore, making the horse's only true purpose simply getting around faster and avoiding enemies as you travel. The story is good, an enigma from the start. You don't have a clue whats going on, but if you pay attention as you play, the pieces of the puzzle start weaving a lovely tapestry of lore. Not boring lore, but truly interesting lore that makes you think about the world and your role in it. The ability to respec your stats infinitely using the rebirth process also adds a little variety to the game and totally removes the purpose of having multiple characters/saves with different builds, not that this is bad as you can simply change your play style at your leisure or if you feel the need to respec for specific bosses. There are an absolute boatload of different fighting styles and weapons with beautiful armor sets to match. The multiplayer is much easier to access and much less of chore than previous games. Invasions are practically a thing of the past. Quite simply, you don't get invaded unless you want to. To be perfectly honest the game is not that hard in comparison to other From Software titles. It comes nowhere near the difficulty of Dark Souls 1 or 3. Sure the challenge is there but it comes nowhere near that of other similar games. Now we get into the bad. There are a few things to note here. First is that the servers are absolutely deplorable. Trying to play with a friend is like pulling teeth. 25% of the time you are simply not able to see their summon sign or the game tells you that you're unable to summon them. 50% of the time your friend will get a connection error about two and a half minutes after being summoned. The last 25% is when it actually works and leads to a good time with your buddies, however this is often cut short after thirty minutes of playing with them. Another problem I have with the game is that enemies don't seem to have unique or interesting moves, often times in lieu of complex or unique attacks most enemies will just spam attacks to the point of it being extremely difficult to get a hit in on them, not due to it being hard but because the timing just doesn't work. When an enemy type just slashes constantly for close to thirty seconds all you can do is run or dodge until its over so you can get a few hits in when they finish. This doesn't add to the difficulty but just makes combat often feel tedious and drawn out much longer than it should be. Next is the ever so obvious fact that this is a piss poor excuse of a port for PC. The game was clearly not designed for PC and was not thoroughly tested on PC with many minor annoyances occurring every, yes EVERY, time you play. Examples of this include; Delayed inputs or having the game totally ignore inputs. This especially applies to duel wielding and dodging. Egregious tracking, e.i. tracking enemies far, far, far away while fighting something right in front of you or even tracking enemies through walls, even in boss arenas. Having issues with your cloud save file is frequent, and if you don't pay attention to which save you decide to backup you could lose hours of progress. Having the game crash on you for no reason is also common, this most often happens when in loading screen. Another problem is the fact that the game gets horribly ""clippy"" or ""framey"" regardless of the graphics settings you have on. There doesn't seem to be any corresponding reason either. It happens at random. The game can run smooth as butter in an area, however you can come back to the same area later on and your game will be choppy as hell. Sometimes it gets so bad that it can actually get you killed in combat, frustrating to say the least. Next is the platforming feeling absolutely wonky as fuck. You can do the exact same inputs to jump or run and jump and get three different results for no apparent reason. This forces you to do what normally would be easy platforming over and over until the game lets you get to where you need to go, a problem I never have had with other souls games. This issue essentially makes platforming the hardest part of game. Lastly, the devs. I get the feeling that the devs want this to be more like a MOBA. With one patch they have effectively ruined what I would consider many perfectly good options for pvp and pve. Both by ""balancing"" aka nerfing and buffing the stats of specific weapons and removing tactics/effects all together on the sole basis of ""its too OP"". In one patch you could go from having a perfect setup for both PVP and PVE to it being laughably bad. This doesn't make any sense to me as literally every combat style, tactic, or spell has some form of a counter that you can incorporate into your play style with ease. I have a feeling this is going to be a recurring a problem with many more ""balance"" patches to come. Its as if they are purposely trying to not establish a meta, but by doing so are establishing brand new metas. If this continues I will ultimately just stop playing the game. Having to quite literally stop using certain weapons or builds that I genuinely enjoy using because one patch makes it effectively un-usable will be the final straw for me and probably many other players. This may just be my opinion but this is not a game that needs to be balanced. Skill should be the deciding factor in pvp and pve not which weapons happen to be strongest or have the strongest ability. Another note to tack onto this is the fact that I'm certain the devs know about the issues with the servers and its connection issues but instead choose to solely address the ""balancing"" issues its just frustrating.So to summarize this review I will be scoring two categories, First the game itself, Second, the Devs and the aforementioned issues. Both will be on a scale of 1-5. The game itself is a solid 5/5The issues the game has would normally make it a 3/5 but with the fact that devs seem to be just making things worse I have to give it a 0/5. I feel that many issues will just be indefinitely ignored all together. The issues make it almost unplayable, almost. If the devs stop messing with ""Balancing"" and actually fix the serves I will update this review, but for now it stays and I sadly cannot recommend this game to anyone looking for a solid gaming experience. So with the game in its current state my rating stands at 5/10",0
Negative,"I have at last finished this behemoth of a game and I am so excited to finally describe why I dont like it.For some context I have played every FromSoftware game past Demon's Souls, which includes Dark Souls, Dark Souls 2, Bloodborne, Dark Souls 3, and Sekiro. With that being said I struggle to put into words how derivative the gameplay is. If you have played Dark Souls 3 you have basically experienced the entire gameplay experience of this game. Same dodging mechanics, weapon mechanics, weapons, animations, gear, rings (now talismans), basically everything. The only major gameplay differences is now you have a horse in the open world, can jump, and can swap weapon arts on normal weapons. Thats it. In fact, a MASSIVE amount of animations are reused. For the player, the enemies, everything. If you have played any of those other games you have seen half of the animations in this game alreadyPeople hype up how hard this game is. It really really isnt that hard. Its maybe on par with Dark Souls 3 at its very hardest. If you have experience with these games you will defeat most bosses in 1-2 tries. A few stand out as quite difficult (Malenia and The Owl Godfrey for example) but the vast majority are quite easy.Speaking of the open world, lets talk about that. Its a FANTASTIC idea in theory. The problem is that is not fun. In these Dark Soulsy games I feel as though part of the experience is exploring the world and picking up all the items and everything. Elden Ring takes that and turns it into such a massive, laborious chore that it makes to dread every time you need to go into a new area. Everything is so spread out, so distant, that finding most of the items and exploring areas takes AGES. It turns the areas in between the many, MANY castles into massive commutes that serve nothing.On the topic of running around, lets talk about the enemies of Elden Ring. When I started this game my intent was to play it as ive played every game before it. Enter new area, go through the process of killing every enemy and then go around and loot everything. This is how I started Elden Ring before I eventually gave up. There is no reason to fight all the enemies. The enemies draw very, VERY little runes (souls from the previous games) and few items, and the game places so many all over the place that its just such a massive chore. By the end of the game the enemies get so unreasonably tanky that you are just sprinting though every area grabbing things and leaving. The minibosses that you find (think black knights from DS1 or outrider knights from DS3) drop literally nothing except a tiny amount of runes. in DS1 every time you killed one you got something like a titanite chunk, some kind of good reward. But nah, nothing in this game. Entirely a waste of time to even bother with them.On the topic of enemies, what about bosses? Most of them are quite easy as ive said before. Some are still fun, others end up being very boring because of this. However, I hope you are ready to fight the same bosses over, and over, and OVER again. You will fight the same Erdtree guardian about 8 times, you will end up fighting about 10 Godskin dudes, etc. You will walk into an arena, see a boss you have killed 5 times already and just sigh. Near the end of the game it gets RIDICULOUS, because the game seems to say ""alright you have fought this guy before BUT HAVE YOU FOUGHT 2 AT THE SAME TIME?"". Im serious, there was a moment in the game where the last 5 bosses were double bosses. Its not fun, its just frustrating and annoying. It was fun when you did it with O&S Fromsoft, its not fun when you spam them. I know why they did this, this game is MASSIVE. You will have to reuse things here and there but my god, id rather have nothing than the same shit over and over.What about good things I can say about this game? Well, its very pretty for one. I love the visuals and its very enjoyable to just look around at the scenery. The worldbuilding and story are quite good, I enjoyed them greatly. As I attempt to write good things about this game I have come to realize the vast majority of good things I can say are just positive from previous games. Its so derivative in terms of gameplay I feel as though I have played this game several times under different names. I played this game when it was called Dark Souls, I played this game when it was called Dark Souls 3, I played this game when it was Bloodborne, Dark Souls 2, etc.Every time boot this game up I was excited to play, and within 30 minutes every time I was absolutely miserable. I only trudged through this game because of how badly I wanted to write this review and get these thoughts out. It has its moments (as described before) but holy crap is it annoying.tl;dr Story and world are nice, the majority of positives are things reused from previous games, and far, FAR too much was reused. It wasnt very difficult and late game is a boring slog as you sprint through every area because fighting every enemy because so tedious and pointless because you get no rewards you just wanna get through it. Just play Sekiro instead its the best game Fromsoft has made and it offers a meaty challenge.",0
Negative,Its a better version of Dark Souls 2; but its still Dark Souls 2.,0
Negative,"TL;Dr game's fun when it chooses to work right, which is less than 10% of the timePretty much almost completed the game and it's one of my favorite game of all time but I am still giving it a negative score even though they patched it up now where there isn't as frequent and as many preformance issues, games should work at launch. Games should not have bad PC ports, how the hell do you make it run worse on a computer when you be making it on a computer? [EDIT] I finally get it able to work and was able to play for a little bit on medium settings but it gets stuck on the loading screen if I put it on high settings (I have a 3090 RTX and 32 GB of ram so there shouldn't be any issues like this!) Game froze midcutscene, not suffering slowdown like others but I have a more poweful rig. Game's really fun when it works, a shame that your chances of getting this game to even boot is like wining the lottery. Please fix this game. This doesn't deseve 10/10 until it works flawlessly on my rig! This game would be a 10/10 if it ran right. It sucks this port sucks and a lot of reviewers that played the PC version covered the poor performance up!Games should work on launch day. Period.I have a MSI Geforce 3090 RTX, 32 GB of ram, I9 processor and an ASUS motherboard. Top of the line computer and the game crashes a black and white screen! Will not recommend until this is patched and as a game developer to another you should be ASHAMED of yourself for releasing a game that doesn't work! You give us a bad name!",0
Negative,Honestly I've had some hopes that console ports will become better. 1. No keyboard tooltips. Only joystick keys. Endless suffering guessing what does (Y) means and why dafuq ESC button doesn't even work where its supposed to. 2. No ultrawide support in 2k22. 3. Fullscreen goes to halfscreen after minimizing kind of glitches.,0
Negative,"Whilst not a terrible game, i still cannot recommend it to anyone who is not a hardcore fan of any souls type games. Falling a certain distance and instant death is frustrating and pointless. Not being able to pause even in offline mode is one of the dumbest things i've encountered. The whole choose your own adventure right from the get go can be tiresome, especially having to look up where to go and what to do every 5 minutes unless you write your own notes down somewhere. It's a very meh game.",0
Negative,"I can't recommend this game due to the recycled bosses and no balancing. These 2 alone make me not even want to finish it once. This game is inferior to DS1 and DS3. PvP isn't fun cuz everyone uses the new shitty weapon arts that require 0 skill. Was fun for the first 70 hours but then became really boring for me. I can't remember how many dragons I killed, how many godskins there are, how many rocky bois I cracked. Also the catacombs all look the same, pretty underwhelming when you compare them to DS1/3. Dunno where Miyazaki's creativity went but it surely didn't come to this waste of money. All I wanted was DS3 with servers. Instead I got DS4 WITHOUT SERVERS (it's 2022 FromSoft come on). This game has too many PvP players to not have at least a server in each one of the 3 ""main"" continents (or at least match-make me only with people from my continent ). FUCK P2P! I'm actually very sad I didn't get my servers. Gonna cry in my room until Elden Ring 2. I hope I'll stop crying then.",0
Negative,"I will give Elden Ring a proper review when they fix the invisible mob bug, which makes the game unplayable for anyone who is experiencing it. All hostile mobs are not visible even when they're hitting me or when I'm hitting them, only their effects, whether that's dust from the dirt they kick up or the fire from a torch they're wielding. The games gorgeous from what I've seen so far and from what I have played so far, which isn't much considering the only thing that didn't have the mob bug was in the tutorial cave.I have spent 5 hours over the last few days trying every standard fix in the book for this. The only ACTUAL fix is a mod fix from the Invisible Mob Bug megathread that's fan made on the Steam discussion boards that I'm aware of right now, and it does indeed work (at least for me), but I'm unable to play in online mode and that's an important part of the experience to me.If you buy the game and notice invisible mobs and don't mind playing offline, try the mod. If not, you'll have to wait for a fix. It is marked as a known bug on their support site, so hopefully it's fixed sooner then not.",0
Negative,"I enjoy the game. but part of the reason I play it is so that I can enjoy playing with my friends and helping them out. The game has so many disconnection issues that it adds punishment into what could already be considered a bit of a slog sometimes. Right now we've been trying to get each other through the random dungeons spread around the map and it's like every time we get to the boss rooms there's about a 50% chance it'll have a connection error before we can beat them. In some dungeons that can mean a 5 minute trek back through, and it can happen multiple times in a row. The connection issues need to be fixed, the system needs a little more tolerance before it just disconnects everyone.Edit: They fixed the issue for a short amount of time, then another update brought the same issues back. Meaning they either built off of a flawed former version for the update or the screwed up something they didn't even need to touch anymore. somehow. Even after all of this playtime, and as much as I enjoy the game, I cannot recommend it for anyone who wants to play online. It continues to be a very subpar experience. for cooperative play.",0
Negative,"I wanted to like this game and I spent a lot of time trying to do so. The combat and visuals are great. The rest, not so much. The story is disjointed, and the questing is too minimalistic. Hopefully western developers can extract the positives out of Elden Ring, then add a good story and questing system. Just a quest log would be fine, no markers or directions needed. Something to prompt my old brain.I also would have preferred a more balanced magic/weapon system as well. There's just something about Japanese story-telling which grates on me also and I can't force myself to complete it. It's a minority view and fair enough - I can't get past these things but I am glad a lot of others have and enjoyed and completed this. I honestly wish I could have been one of them.",0
Negative,"First, let me start off by saying that my Steam profile does not represent my soulsbornekiro career, mainly because I've played all games on either PS3, PS4 or a new PS4 Pro on a new account for various reasons, thus I invested a lot -I mean A LOT- of time in these games. I've done it all, I've done some SL1 runs, some other challenges, put a lot of time into PvP as well. The only reason I'm saying this is to show that there is weight behind the negative review and that it is not just a ""git gud"" issue. The open world is definitely new. It felt new and it felt good. The problem with starts either at NG+ or a little before that when you think you've done everything. I have no problems with the enemy variants such as Leyndell soldiers and Haligtree soldiers. The problem I do have with this world is that almost all dragons are exactly the same and almost all bosses have stupid variants, sometimes even as duos. All they have is a ton more health and the ability to dish out more damage in a single hit. Sometimes they have extra moves, sometimes. Speaking of enemies and bosses, this game is not Sekiro, it is not Bloodborne, and it is definitely not Dark Souls 3. Why is it trying to be all three at the same time somehow when it's obvious that it can't succeed in doing that? The bosses are designed to look like Bloodborne enemies, act like Sekiro enemies that give no openings at all while just going at it, and the DS3 element comes to life thanks to our player character who has a stamina bar and no way to deflect attacks like Sekiro does. Obviously the game is not at all impossible and the whole ""easy difficulty"" thing is just actual retardation so I'm not going into that. What I'm going to be going into is that this game does not take kindly to pure builds, you kind of have to go for a hybrid build because all armaments that are relevant are either STR/DEX/INT, STR/DEX/FTH, STR/FTH, STR/INT or any of these but with an additional ARC. This may not sound completely bad but there are so many people who just want a sword and just start slashing. Even quality builds aren't favored. All of those caster STR or DEX hybrids perform better than a straight up STR, DEX or quality build. They have an easier time dealing with EVERYTHING in the game. In my humble opinion, that is NOT how it should have been handled. Now, legendary armaments, sorceries, incantations, and status effects. I wanted them to be good, I wanted them to be useful. They are not useful, they are just simply broken. Just level DEX/INT and become an idiot with a Moonveil like the rest of the playerbase to one shot and/or stagger everything in a few hits with its stupid skill. That's just one example, yes it does make me mad but most unique skills are extremely dumb. As for status effects. really? Who came up with madness? All of us know how status effects are handled in PvP but madness? It's impossible to dodge it because even if you do the bar gets filled and boom, you're dead. Amazing. The more I talk about this game the more frustrated I get. During the first 20 hours I thought this game deserved all the praise, now I think it deserves none of it. The soundtrack is good, so is the character creation. The hit sequence thing from Bloodborne is also a good touch. That's about it.",0
Negative,all the prompts are made for a console. it is super annoying,0
Negative,This game is like a choose your own adventure book that kicks you in the teeth every time you pick the wrong page.,0
Negative,"WARNING SPOILERSI cannot recommend this game in good faith. To tell a long story short, Elden Ring jumps from being the best souls game to the worst souls game in seconds and seemingly at random. Whilst some bosses are excellent and some of the best fun you could have in a souls game, the others are so painfully bad that they detract from the experience as a whole.This game reuses bosses more often than DS2. The most egregious examples to me are the ""Commander"" bosses, who combine the most hated elements of DS bosses (ganking and attacks with bullshit AOE) who are the exact same looking and have similar names. At least the smelter demons were different colours. And the other, the boss making me write this review, the Godskin Duo. This boss takes two medium high difficulty bosses and makes you fight them both at once, and they respawn after you kill them the first time. Late game bosses in Elden Ring, as opposed to more complex movesets, harder parry times, etc. just do more damage and have more AoE. Godskin Duo is two fast, agile enemies against you in a cramped room, both with ranged and lunge attacks and combos reminiscent of the dancer from DS3. This isn't me needing to get good, I've beaten BB, DS2&3 and a myriad of other souls likes. And it's not just me. In defeat I looked online for a strategy to beat them and just found other people bitching about them.I want to love this game, and when you're just riding around or exploring the good areas it really is easy to love. The game's world was made by George R. R. Martin and anyone who's read A Song of Ice and Fire can see that, with mentions of houses and heraldry and themes of existentialism and free will. The game's art direction is fantastic, everything looks and sounds amazing. Elden Ring also boasts the best From Soft souls character creator, making customising your character fun all the way through, further aided by being able to change your appearance at any time.The game feels like an abusive relationship. It's so amazing and immersive and wonderful in one moment, then shows all it's negative traits in a truly painful boss or level, and then as soon as that's over you're sucked in again. This game is only a balance fix away from being the best Souls game and maybe the best game of all time, but until then I'd hold off. I went in entirely blind, purposefully avoiding all information on it since it was announced and I really think that's added to my enjoyment.TLDR: great game held back by exceedingly bad moments",0
Negative,The game itself looks amazing but in it's current state I cannot recommend it - I'm playing on a beefy gaming pc and had constant stuttering to the point of it ruining boss battles. I ended up refunding the game but if they fix the stuttering problems I will give it another try in the future,0
Negative,This game made me enjoy Dark Souls 2,0

Negative,"84 hours logged at time of writing, 100% of achievements acquired. Elden Ring is the latest and greatest SOULS game, but serves as more of an introduction to the genre than a defining title. The novelty of the OPEN WORLD sets the series back instead of advancing it; level design, apart from legacy dungeons, is bland and uninspiring, and copy-pasted points of interests are so stale that you can't be bothered to do them by the time you complete the first area (Limgrave). Graphics in the open world are bland due to infinitely repeating textures. The graphics look closer to Pok mon Legends: Arceus than Breath of the Wild. The legendary SOULS boss fights are often a total cake-walk due to the impossibly ambitious task of balancing for so many weapons, spells, etc. and the level you will encounter the boss at. Combat often does not feel rewarding, and it does not convey the sense of satisfaction that you beat the boss with pure skill like Sekiro did. Sekiro was GOTY. It is March, and I am not at all ready to call Elden Ring GOTY.THE PROS======== Large open world gives freedom to explore, conquer levels in not-quite-any order Robust character creation and customization. You can be a mage, warrior, great sword user, katana user, or any combination there-of Generally challenging combat, familiar to SOULS veterans The open world does not hold your hand in the way that canned UBISOFT games do The few legacy dungeons are generally well designed, but re-use too many of the same assets to feel memorable or uniqueTHE CONS======== 60 FPS rate limit in 2022 LOL + random stutters between invisible loading zones The nature of the open world means that it is unlikely that a zone will feel ""just right"" when you arrive. Either you will be over-levelled and SMASH through it, or be under-levelled and have to run. The nature of the open world similarly means that many ""EPIC"" bosses are a complete push-over. I am not a god at SOULS games, but I beat many of the main story bosses on my first try The nature of the open world means that it is basically impossible to balance. DARK SOULS and SEKIRO give you a carefully curated adventure, with bosses and zones that ramp up in difficulty smoothly. Elden Rings does not. The traditional genre-defining SOULS interconnected levels make exploration actually much more interesting than a generic open world. Finding shortcuts that linked legacy dungeons together, and then struggling to visualize what the 3D world map must look like is a mind-blowing experience that they got rid of The majority of spells feel terrible to use. The AWESOME COOL dragon incantations for example, have incredible animations, use a ton of mana, and do piddly damage. And their cast animations are so long that you have a very low chance of getting them off successfully, even when used after an enemy's attack pattern has just finished. Of the dozens of spells, I used, just a few were worth using. The atmospheric music is almost non-existent. I can't remember any scores except the first 15 seconds of the title music. The ""open world"" dungeons scattered throughout the map are so generic and COPY+PASTED they get old incredibly fast as they all have a very similar layout and a few annoying enemies predictably hidden around corners or on the ceiling. The open world outdoors does NOT use space in an interesting way. Points of interests are spread so far apart, with practically nothing between them but for a few weeds. The POIs are the same throughout the entire game: ruined church, ever gaol, boring cave, encampment, etc. Open world textures are really low resolution and the game does not look beautiful with the exception of the underground starry night area. Plot? Story? Apologists will tell you that it's actually really good, you just have to dig deep to find the elaborately-constructed GRRM-tier supreme narrative. Crafting is close to useless So many of the bosses are just copy-pastes, even for main-path bosses. And so many of them are gimmicks.",0
Negative,"It's incredible how willing this company is to ignore its millions of loyal PC customers. I don't understand why they would put so much love and work into a game just to destroy it all by neglecting a specific platform. The game is missing basic PC and graphics settings, such as vsync, DLSS, chromatic abberation, FPS limits, and ultrawide support. It lacks an option for Playstation button prompts, which is particularly annoying. There are major performance and stuttering issues on even the highest tier of gaming hardware.Regardless of gameplay, I can't recommend it on PC until basic features are added. I can't say I didn't expect it, but it's still sad to see another sub-par FromSoft PC port.",0
Negative,"Don't get me wrong this game has a fun game mechanic however it has one annoying thing about it.If you are a low level character and you want to play with a friend, It is a interesting concept that you gotta make a rune to invite/summon your friend but it is the fact if they die, They get taken out of the session.The fact that anybody can evade / attack lower level players who are grouping, is just not right and makes the whole experience unfun for the lower unexperience users and can make them feel very unsettled and discouraged to try anymore.This will lead to players only wanting to play solo and not play with friends anymore, to avoid evaders.The landscape is quite pretty and stealth kills are pretty silk too.I can't give a full review on this game since I don't have enough hours but so far. Everything else is good just not the multiplayer crap. It's irritating enough to just figure out how it all works and to get it to work for cross-region players.This game also has no CROSSPLATFORM, so you will not be able to play with your xbox/ps player friends while you are on a PC.",0

Negative,"The single player game portion was the strongest part of this game. Being advertised with a multiplayer emphasis, I was severely upset with the execution. Co-Operative play is practically useless since my friends get disconnected often (great internet speeds for us). Also we get invaded within 2 minutes of co-op play. Its a constant struggle when Invaders are allowed to hack and harass with no issue when I can't get a solid set of time with my friends. Also, when I examine a door or message, the message will persist and I cant dodge/run/roll/attack the enemy attacking me. All updates thus far has not helped the issues i've been experiencing.",0
Negative,"I really wish I could give this game a recommendation, but I just can't. After playing through the Dark Souls series and Bloodborne, this is the only game other than Dark Souls 2 that I have yet to finish. This game is absolutely incredible up until a specific point. After this point, the recycled content and horrific level scaling really start to show up and the game just becomes unfun to play. There's so may bosses that I want to fight and I want to finish this game, but its so hard to get through all the same bosses that I've fought multiple times and a lack of new enemies for the past 10 hours of gameplay. If you've never played the souls games before I would recommend this game, but I think that this game is too big for its own good",0
Negative,"Dark souls infected with the fever of the open world trend.The first 20 hours was honey mounth. I was exploring with no stone unturned trying not to miss a drop of content. I found my weapon, got a few levels and cleared out Stormhill Castle. A leisurely balanced start. After that I continued my exploration in early game locations which somehow guided me to the red biome. And this is there it comes. The biggest mistake of my playthrough - chosing to explore Caelid before visiting Morne Castle and Academy.1. Open world has the ""right way""There is no autolvling in the game. So if u come too early in late game location u ll prob get fucked. If u come later then needed u ll get 0 runes and creep boss. If u come early and overcome difficulties, game will turn u in opposite direction at the end without providing main boss fight. This is what happend with me in Caelid. I cleared out this terrible place, kill 2 strong prebosses In an attempt to get to the demigod. And u know what? Game just said ""Sorry bruh, come back later when you visit the Plateau"" (Actually game didnt say shit. I read about Plateau later on wiki) I was kinda tilted. But not only because of dissatisfaction with the feeling of incompleteness. The whole clearing of Caelid was terrible. The location itself is a victim of bad game design.2. Design Art design didnt make a big step since previous games. If you do not take into account the gorgeous views of landscapes, honestly DS3, even DS1 look much more cozy, soulful and atmospheric up close. It is incorrect to compare this game with Bloodborne, because the latter is basically on a different level of style and charm. Speaking for example the red biome looks like the worst location in the entire series. Starting with same double bosses which are almost impassable without using casual Spirit Ashes or inviting other players to help. Ending with terrible toxic bloody colors of landscape, crazy oppressive soundtrack, ugly mobs and enviroment. I understand that devs tried to make an atmosphere of hell's cesspool. But its just DISGUSTING to be there. 3. Secondary bosses/mini bossesIn my opinion its not the best way to make game more diffuclt increasing the numbers. Especially if you have already used this mob several times before. But the open world requires fullness. That is why the developers decided not to bother with secondary bosses and used the same mobs with indentical movesets for 5-10 times. Such an approach evokes a sense of secondary experience. But at the same time its just hard to skip another cave, tomb, fort (which are systemed and actually made from same assets, textures, models etc) cause of new talisman or weapons upgrates, or random NPCs. This need for research lengthens the game by several tens of hours. So more content is good u say. But not really. As I said before there are a lot secondary expirience, And after 70 hours of singleplayer extensive gaming I just got overflowed of it.4. Music, soundJust compare DS 3 and ER main themes, Its obvious. Same with boss arenas.Elden Ring gets u in the first place. But the more you play, the less the game surprises you. The developers have done a good job on the bugs in technical terms, working on the old game conventions. (jumping mechanics, interface elements, etc.). Although from the point of view of art design, music the game does not surpass its predecessors. I would rather play linear dark souls 4 for 30 hours with only original content, designed in a single style, than in this 100-hour open world variety.",0
Negative,"This game is a buggy, performance-killing mess. I bought this game because my friend, who has played every Dark Souls game, wanted to co-op with me. With the devs pitching this as the ""best multiplayer game"" of this year, I expected at least a baseline of functionality for multiplayer. Doing a dungeon with your buddy does NOT complete it for you. You have to do it TWICE. The multiplayer is NOT truly open world. Each region and dungeon is instanced and you can't leave the region you start your multiplayer in. The icing on the cake is that when you defeat the region's boss you can no longer co-op that area. You might think I'm being picky about that one since you may be wondering why someone would want to even enter a dungeon again after completing it, but the issue is that this also applies to all the open-world zones. Once you kill the area boss, which you have NO IDEA which of the dozen copy pasted elite enemies across the areas counts as the actual boss, you're now playing solo for good in a game that promised you seamless multiplayer. And while there are all sorts of mixed opinions about the whole invasion mechanic where other players just casually drop in to use all the dungeon enemies to murder you, I will say that there is very short cooldown on it. More than once I've had multiple invaders with only five minutes between them. Sure, it's part of the game. But if I'm trying to finish a dungeon and a guy invades just to sit on the miniboss I need to get past to force me to fight him AND the boss, I'm going to be a little frustrated. I've had people multiple times just sit ahead of where I'm clearing for 20+ minutes because I don't want to fight him and a one-shotting mob at the same time. Paired with the fact that multiplayer is highly unstable and your friends will always be disconnecting, which also immediately resets the cooldown on invades, and you're in for a good time. God forbid you have two friends who want to play, because the third player will only stay connected for two to three minutes at a time. In fact, I can usually tell when I'm being invaded because, when I'm playing with one friend, the addition of the invader makes my friend's connection drop. This also happens with hunters, who, even though they're supposed to appear to assist against invades, frequently disconnect without ever appearing. Another frustrating element is that, since the world is extremely large, you have a horse that is completely disabled in multiplayer. And forget healing. All of your consumable pots are more than halved when you're a guest in someone's world and no one can rest to replenish them in a multiplayer session. It's likely the connection issues will eventually be fixed, but I want to warn anyone who is considering playing this game with a friend that the multiplayer elements are more confined to just the dungeons.",0

Negative,"I got it as it was supposed to be the more accessible soulslike and wanted to try at least one out. If that is more accessible I hate to see what the others are like as it is frustrating. My experience is that the monsters in the first area are way too hard and it is easy to die to normal monsters(3 or 4 hits) let alone bosses or minibosses(1 or 2 hits) that litter the main walkways of the early area. So, its die alot and grind alot and redo the first areas monsters in the hope that one day you are strong enough to finish the first area monsters let alone later game bosses, which is supposed to be rewarding but doesn't seem to be as there is no real payoff to beating them. Lets just say that I didn't find it accessible at all. Now the good, there are some nice details in the areas and the NPC's so far are mildly interesting. I am probably going to try to suffer through and finish it with some tips I got on how to progress that won't make it easier but possible to continue and maybe even complete but I don't have high hopes - aka its just interesting enough to give it a good attempt and maybe if I do it in small pieces the frustration will be minimized and one day I will finish it. If you get it turn off online though, there are alot of people who will try to mislead you for some unknown reason and the comments they leave are antagonistic and it's a troll fest - aka it draws in alot of dysfunctional people as far as I can tell, must be what this style of game brings in and that says alot about the nature of this game. There is also no real Tutorial that I can see so to find out anything basic to play it you have to google search how to do it. I also don't feel it respects your time as a player plus the pacing and payoffs aren't up to snuff. I was hoping it would have been more like Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen but sadly it was the typical difficulty and frustration soulslike.",0
Negative,"Absolutly loving the game. played for 8 hours straight. afterward i closed the game. few hours later start it up again. turns out, all the progress i made didnt save.

The stutters from shader loading are really annoying and really kill you a lot of times, because it slows down the game unpredictably, but my real problem is the raw performance in the open world. Not recommending this game on PC right now, we really need an optimization patch.",0

Just endless griefing and tryharding.Then theres the actual game, which just stops being enjoyable once you start realizing just how fucking stupid bosses like Margitt look when he winds up his staff and holds it above his head running at you for 5 whole seconds before swinging on the input of your dodge.The lore is cut to shit, nothing makes much sense, everyone and everything seem lifeless and inhuman.Nah, just nah.Elden Mid.",0

Negative,"I know people will say, ""but it has only just released, wait for a patch""; It's a damn shame this is what gaming has come to. This game has been hyped up for ages and yet, no one seems to have cared enough to ensure things actually work upon release, even on a fundamental level! A recommended hard-pass for any M&K users; even controllers seem largely hit and miss. 0/10",0
Negative,"if i pay AAA price for a game there shouldn't be any stuttering issues, arbitrary drops or impossibility to setting keyboard&mouse as a default instead of a controller. content itself may be good enough to justify hype but technical issues makes it hard for the game to utilize its potential. it's especially annoying when you consider that localized prices of elden ring is significantly higher compared to other AAA titles overall",0
Negative,"For each thing this game does right, there's frustration to be had elsewhere. This makes certain parts of the game great, while other areas feel like a chore. As much as the adventure can be memorable and the controls exceptional, several of the bosses are not fun to engage with at all, and that's only the tip of the iceberg.If Breath of the Wild's open world made you wonder what's over the hill, Elden Ring's open world often makes you question where the designers really intended for you to go next.That is largely due to the game's cryptic NPC questline progression, coupled with the fact that each area has a hidden recommended level. You either find out where you're meant to go the hard way, or through a guide. If you explore a harder area before an easier one, you'll be over-leveled for the area you were meant to go first, and the bosses there won't be as enjoyable as they could have been, further encouraging the use of a guide.Many bosses are either too easy to be satisfying, or too much of a pain in the rear to be enjoyable to fight. An example of the latter would be the Fallingstar Beasts. A keen eye will have noticed the plural there. That is because this game reuses almost all of its bosses several times, to pad out the ill-conceived open world. Also, some of the main bosses are gimmick battles. These should be epic moments to test your personal build against the game's mightiest foes, but they are not.I don't believe anyone enjoys being forced to change their build or weapon type just because few options remain viable for the whole game. The point of a roleplaying game should be to keep growing your character from start to finish. If you're stubborn about designing your game in this manner though, at least give the player unlimited respecs so they won't be scared to experiment. This would allow players to figure out, through painful trial and error, what is viable in the game without relying on guides. Larval tears aren't an ideal solution at all, as there's no way to know how many there are in total, as well as where they are, without consulting external sources. Plus, if you respec into something bad, you're screwed until the next larval tear.The filler space between the content, fittingly called ""The Lands Between"", is often uninteresting. This is something I feel no open world game has fully solved yet, but it can be pretty noticeably bad here. It's not like you'll have memorable encounters with NPCs on the side of the road or anything like that. It's mostly all combat, especially the further you get into the game. Which is fine, it's a FromSoftware game right? But, that means the only really enjoyable thing to find in the open world is a cave or a dungeon, as they are designed spaces for you to explore, with carefully placed enemies to clear out, and a boss to vanquish at the end. Each one makes for a satisfying little adventure. The problem is, without a guide, you might spend more time searching for the next location of interest than it took you to complete the last.Furthermore, due to how item locations are static in this game, there's an optimal route for you to take in order to obtain the items you'll actually use as part of your build. You have no real reason to clear content outside of that, because the loot obtained in those other areas will be completely useless to you. Receiving completely unusable loot is generally lame in any game, but it's especially bad here, because it's not random loot. This is bad design because it means that following a guide is needed to make the pacing of the game's progression bearable, but doing so makes the open world feel completely artificial because you no longer have the sense of wonder bequeathed by the unknown.If we're really honest here, this game is immensely flawed and often more annoying than fun, despite its exceptional controls that make your hands feel like they were made to hold a controller. Maybe Elden Ring's flaws are what makes it interesting. Maybe the idea that you can overcome a torturous experience with a community of like-minded individuals and forge a communal bond through it is what makes Elden Ring worth engaging with. Or maybe 2022 was a bad year for big game releases, and this is the best one we could salvage from it. Either way, this game will always be as loved as it is hated.Hopefully, the success of this game will encourage the industry to look at the formula and figure out how it can be improved further, because it has a ton of room to grow. In some ways, this game succeeds where Breath of the Wild faltered. In other ways, it's the opposite. A lot more needed to change from the Souls formula to make this a homerun. Co-op could have been at the forefront of this game, but it clearly is not. The Seamless Co-op mod helps with this, but does so at the expense of other important features, doesn't solve other issues this game has, is still buggy, and should not be needed to begin with.I think Elden Ring's biggest flaw is that it has an identity crisis. Some bosses feel designed for co-op, some feel designed for single-player, while some feel designed for another game entirely. With the most asinine co-op integration you could imagine, it's pretty hard for me to recommend this game to most people past the initial hype it had at launch, hence my carefully deliberated decision to go with a more negative review.There is obviously a lot to enjoy in this game. I would not play a game for this long if I hated all of it, but I've studied it enough to understand the ways in which it is flawed, and I think it's important to address these flaws now that the game has sold like hot cakes and won GOTY awards, if only for the sake of information.In conclusion, I look forward to the day when we can look back at Elden Ring and call it an obsolete relic of the past. Not because it's a bad game, but because I know we can do better.",0
Negative,"My experience with this game was such a mixed bag. I feel like I spent half the time being bored because I know everything this game will do, and half the time being awe struck at some of the destinations on the map. I feel like people misrepresent the amount of times you enter a cave that is literally copy pasted content with the only difference being whether it's longer, has more enemies or introduces a mechanic where everything looks the same 3 times over to fuck with you. The amount of reused bosses is absolutely insane. You fight Erdtree Avatar more than 10 times, you fight Tree Spirits 10 times, you fight that dragon knight dude underground 3 times, you fight those stone cat looking dudes 5 times etc. It just made me want to skip a lot of the content, I missed about 10 caves and here I am being overjoyed I did because I couldn't have bothered with that recycled shit for a second longer. But then you get to the Capital City, and your jaw drops. The stunning visuals and attention to detail grabs you, when you exit out of the room the little dudes playing along with the song catches you in this insane feeling of immersion and you're locked in. You can explore every corner of this place which is massive coming from Dark Souls 3. This is Elden Ring at it's best. This is the Dark Souls they wanted to make. But sadly those moment are too far in between, at least for me. I'd say about 3-4 areas did that for me. The rest was just the usual dark souls.The environment is filled with so many gamer mechanics, by that I mean ladders that are as long as MGS 3 ladders. Platforms placed just so you can jump onto them. It doesn't feel organic it just takes you out of the experience. This isn't really that much of a problem but it's kinda weird that you can upgrade your weapon to fucking +25. It just feels like too much. Like they just made the game long and had no idea how to balance the weapons or something and just said ""fuck it, slap a 25 on there and call it a day"". But the somber smithing stone weapons go to +10? Weird.Elden Ring is not a masterpiece that seemingly everyone gives it praise for, it has many flaws that are overlooked by so many people it makes me wonder if we played the same game. It's by no means bad, in the sea of unapologetically trash Triple A releases Elden Ring is a polished diamond. But as a Dark Souls game it never really did it for me. I wasn't even that hyped about this game and it still disappointed me in many aspects. Elden Ring is a product aimed for everyone, and It seems to have done just that. But in return I'm not as attached to this product as I am to Dark Souls 3. Cya.",0
Negative,Game has a lot going for it. The world is immersive. The freedom do go where ever you choose .and die . is great. BUT It runs very inconsistently . I will get 60fps but it does not feel smooth much of the time. It randomly stutters no matter settings. It wont even utilize over 50% my cpu or gpu. I would wait for them to patch this game before purchase. Unfortunately cannot recommend for now .,0
Negative,"Despite this being a negative review, this is to highlight the more long-term problems with the DLC, and some others that the game has possessed for a while. The DLC is *very* good, and more worth it than most modern games even after bumped down to the same price range.But there are *four* problems in specific, one of which is SotE specific.1. Scadutree BlessingsOn paper, its an interesting idea. To reiterate what they are: they are items that you need to ""level up"" for the DLC's specific frame of leveling. These can boost your numbers *quite* substantially, moreso than basic equipment upgrades or even levels can. Sekiro had something like it, and it was generally enjoyed - or not cared about - there. But Sekiro is a comparatively linear, more mechanically-minimalist game than Elden Ring is, being more along the lines of a character action game than a widely open-ended RPG. Here, there are *so* many of them, and *so* many blessings. People will say ""this incentivizes exploration."" But Elden Ring already did that. Either by having a variety of items to find - oftentimes said items were of the quest/key variety - or going in whichever direction you want to gain levels. Both of these things are a strength of the base game, especially as the former are generally in rare and more obviously-located supply. Moreover, NPC questlines often dictated if there would even *be* something in a corner of the game world. While Scadutree fragments are *generally* found at Golden Crosses, many others are dropped by somewhat unassumingly-designed enemies, that are often placed into basic foliage and enemy-filled fields, which they may blend into. Many people consider several of the bosses in this, even with Scadutree Blessings, to rank among the hardest in the developer's catalog. This raises two questions: if bosses are going to be that hard anyways, then what's really the point of having this new power system, besides stalling the early game? Secondly, now it's not ""I have to go level up"" or ""keep trying a boss until I get better at it."" It's ""I have to now go scrape the corners of the game world, possibly so I can even stand a chance."" In the basegame you had choice of what you wanted to farm for levels. Here, you may have to pull up a googled checklist if you're not agonizingly thorough. This effectively will hamper replay value, as it will no longer be ""just explore"" on replays - it will be ""do the checklist,"" ontop of the existing checklist baked into the games core. The basegame could effectively be mostly ignored, and that was one of its strengths. All in all, Scadutree fragments remind me of the MMO-style ""borrowed power"" system. Anyone who knows that is groaning reading this. Borrowed power was a system where, at the end of each expansion, you lost the power you had last expansion that you only gained through tremendous grinding. Moreover, on alt-characters, it made you have to redo the whole grinding experience again just to do the content your other characters can do. In some cases, you even sort of lost it with each patch. In effect, it made the levels and gear you did have seem like they didn't really matter. Most MMOs have removed this system by now, or streamlined it, or still have it as sticking points to great expansions. Now why is this in the expansion? To make sure that it's hard? Levels after a *certain point* effectively stop mattering, and most players would be *around* that point anyways. It would already be very hard if you set the difficulty *for* that level range. Moreover, the game has baked-in ways to make it hard, like NG+, not using summons, or special ""debuff"" rings. Or, just, not levelling, or going effectively naked. Scadutree Blessings are unnecessary that in the long-term are a chore, and other mediums of this scope - which were built *for* these systems - have proven these systems redundancy.2. Boss designSome of these bosses, like Rellana, are astounding. But we're quickly reaching a point where the developer can't *do* really anything else to keep making encounters ""harder."" People already have griped about bosses doing their flips and acrobatics and 15-hit rush-attack chains, but I don't think anyone's yet elaborated on *why* this is so much of a problem. Bloodborne and Sekiro gave you the speed to constantly trade with the boss, or built-in tools to effectively stop almost any boss in their tracks. Here, it still *plays* like Dark Souls, and you even have a load of super cool weapons and spells with really elaborate combo's, but you effectively can't use them. Either the bosses never stop moving, or you can't stagger anything worth enough to get more than one hit in. Without the mechanics of poise - and a defense value on gear that matters - heavy builds are subject to ""just backpedal until you hit them once."" Super light weapons like daggers seem effectively pointless compared to a straight sword, outside of the sparse few times you may land a crit - for which there are already rings to better facilitate. As a bow user myself, the only real effective way to use a bow in a boss - normal, not greatbow - is to just spam rain of arrows, or just keep jumping backwards while shooting. Bloodborne gave bosses - like the Cleric Beast - weak spots you could shoot or throw grenades at, and this would cripple the boss in some way - also allowing for an easy crit. That doesn't really exist here, and even if it did, bosses move around too much to make the shot feasible or worthwhile. All the ""hard"" bosses effectively play the same in this regard. They rarely stand out anymore. It feels like FROMSOFTWARE has played all its hands if it keeps wanting to go in this direction, and if they're adamant about not adding the convenience the other games provided. We all by now probably know about the popularity boost Kai Cenat gave this game. The strategies he often used - just spamming one weapon art on a good weapon every fifteen or twenty seconds - are far too commonplace and far too necessary.3. PatchesI don't mean the NPC, he's a real one. No, I mean how FROMSOFTWARE games have started to treat their patches like Destiny 2 patches. Prime example in *this* DLC: Hoarfrost Stomp. Used to be super good. Is still *very* good. But one of the new stomp-based attacks, effectively, is just what Hoarfrost Stomp was pre-nerf. Why would they even bother, then? At least Destiny 2 has a live-service element to it, and even still, that's *still* scummy there. Moreover, weapon values like, again, lighter weapons, have had their poise damage value on enemies reduced. Some of the lighter enemies, then, effectively have movement frames that effectively nullify the value of these lighter weapons - being able to hit and shut down enemies that move a lot - compared to something akin to a straight sword. Thislive-service-like balancing is confusing more than anything else. Nerfing things just because you'll add something better in a DLC or patch, is effectively just planned obsolescence. The multiplayer component of this game is not *that* big of a focus, despite what the community will say, so that's not much of an excuse either. Buildcrafting is what *makes* replays of these games. 4. InvasionsThe system is breaking. Being able to only really invade groups, means you have no reason to face them head-on. DS3 had the invader Sunbros. Why is this not back? Alternatively: a system to queue into an ""invasion lobby"" with others. Or, hell, just let a solo invader use a summon. Instead, outside of community-imposed dueling arenas, invasions are just both parties standing there until one side gets bored enough to leave, the invader commits kms, or the invader needs cheese strats. With the invader continuously running, something like a battle royale ""timed death wall"" is needed to force both parties to come together to just fight each other and stop wasting each others time. Or, at least, something like Giant Tree Seeds from 2.",0

I stopped playing when I realized that I'd gotten genuinely irritated with my dog for the sin of bumping into my leg. Nothing so dully repetitive is worth that.",0
Negative,"Probably my most anticipated game of 2022, and when I first started the game up and entered the lands between I was in gamer heaven, an Open world Dark souls game, whats not to like. Well, After ""Almost"" completing the game. My thoughts are, This game is really bad overall. I'm going to start with the good.The Combat and movement and other stuff regarding the player: Really an improvement form dark souls 3, but a downgrade from Sekiro. Not that it had to be exactly like Sekiro, but a blend of Dark Souls 3 and Sekrio would have been nice. Not the case, it's basically Dark Souls 3 with smoother response times and a jump, which is a really nice addition. Other aspects of the game design I liked was the crafting, and the horse, awesome additions, especially with the open world.Graphics:Love the visuals of this game, and the Boss designs are amazing. Basically perfect. Not photo realistic, obviously. I told myself when I first bought the game I'd go down to the coast and check out the cliffs, I did, and was blown away at the shear size of them. Really set the tone at an eleven. The rest of the game does not hold up to these first impressions, but man was I excited at the early stages. There are allot of massive too scale environments that you'll be blown away by. At first, and then later a ton of stuff is not scaled correctly. Thats all the good I can think of, There's the obvious, like voice acting and music, but those are givens with FromSoft's games at this point. My favorite Npc was the blacksmith. Really liked whoever did his voice acting. All of them are good though.The bad. The pacing:The pacing is terrible in this game, its a given that when making an open world experience your going to have a grinding/over leveling problem, but all of FromSoft's games have this problem to some extent and none of them allow me to basically one shot bosses in later areas of the game, it feels terrible and basically ruins the ""dance"" that was DS3 and Sekiro's combat. Why even make the move sets complex and varied at this point. And no its not hard to over level. I wasn't even trying and I ended killing bosses that looked cool for about two seconds before they died. And then the other side of things you have bosses that are overly difficult, in that they one shot you instead. And I could stomach a one shot boss as long as it was fun, but this leads me into my second problem.Boss Move Sets: The Bosses in this game for the most part are bad. They look cool, except for the stone dog/cat, those are just lazy filler boss design. The two types of bosses are basically mini bosses which get rehashed over and over again, or major bosses that range from good to downright awful. An example of a good fight would be Margot and Godrick. These bosses are challenging, and while I have my issues with them, they're really solid overall. Pretty much every boss after these two are terrible, and I'm only counting the major bosses that aren't duplicated into oblivion. Radahn was the best out of these, but his stupid design ruined it. Like what is that thing hes riding, it looks so dumb. It ruined his otherwise decent fight. I honestly was laughing at him the whole time, and when he does the meteor attack, your telling me he took his half starved mangled horse with him? Really wanted to like that fight. Another disappointing fight was Rennala, the build up is there, the boss room is really cool, and then woosh. Your out in a ankle deep lake and her main attack is summoning enemies you've fought before as ghosts? What about Malekath, which becomes sit there watching him jump around, and then run up and hit him when he stops moving. Repeat. I really wanted to like these bosses but couldn't considering what we had before. like Gael, Pontiff, the Lothric Princes, The Great Ape and Genichiro. Those bosses are in another league compared to Elden Ring. Nothing in Elden Ring comes close. And I haven't even talked about the duplicate bosses in depth. All you need to know is that at the end of every cave, every dungeon, is just another mini boss that you've fought before. Like the God skin Apostles god help me. Those two are by far the single worst thing that exists in this game. besides the stone guard dogs. A handful mini bosses are only duplicated a few times, but are so easy they don't justify even existing as a boss fight. But I played through Dark Souls 2, and that game has the worst boss move sets by far out of the souls series, so why did I like that game more then Elden Ring. Because Elden Ring does something I never thought I'd see from FromSoft. Under scaling levels: Like villages, even castles. I was expecting a handcrafted world, not repeat villages, dungeons, and caves, with the same bear, or guard dog, or wolf mini boss at the end. The best way to put it is everything is a front, it looks good from a distance but as you get closer the realization hits you, there's no substance under this epic looking coastline, or this larger then life high wall that makes up the Capital City. Dark souls had massive interconnected worlds, with levels like the Undead Village, Lothric Castle in it's entirety. Those where to scale, compared to Elden Rings far smaller, far emptier level design, populated by ""you guessed it"" duplicate bosses. My most disappointing moment was when I found the lobster shack, I was thinking how cool It'd be if I could go inside, and there would be an npc I could talk to, maybe a sight of grace to sit at next to a fireplace. Maybe a kitchen with a pot in the corner I could loot some lobsters from. Nope. A prop house that I've seen a bunch of times already. No depth. Under scaled. The beginning of the game felt allot better in this regard, but I think its because everything was fresh and new. I think if the game was more purposeful. Not linear really, just everything was placed and created for a reason outside of ""a house is needed here, or a mini boss is needed here, so lets just select one from our arsenal and pop it in there, yeah lets just throw a Stone Guard dog in that boss room that literally looks exactly the same as all the rest"" .I don't know, on one hand the game is one of a kind and really gave me a feeling of what a perfect game could be, and on the other, it's a painful experience that I wish I never played. If you can forgive the lazy level design and the mostly mediocre bosses.maybe you wont mind this game, you might even enjoy it. But coming off of Sekiro, and DS3 , this is just a bad game.Just play those if you haven't already. Anyways if I had to settle on a score, It'd be 5/10 on average. A 3/10 at its worst. And a 8/10 for the first ten/fifteen hours or so of the game.",0

The multiplayer from the get go is a little confusing on how to do, if you're not used to playing the souls games. The multiplayer areas are very odd, requiring players to back out of a multiplayer session and go back in, just to play the area with friends. Then to top it all off when you defeat certain field bosses in an area, it will stop you from playing with your friends in your world. This multiplayer system is very frustrating for people like me who just want to play this game with friends.

Negative,"I've pushed myself to 100 hours in this game, reaching the late game areas, and I can't go an inch further with it; far short of the amount of time I've spent in all the other Soulsborne games, even DSII. I feel as though it's tried far too hard to ""out-Dark Souls"" the preceding Dark Souls games that it is almost a parody. Jumping the shark is another way to put it.Quite a lot of the time I feel as though the game has too much in common with DSII's encounter designs - areas filled with enemies ready to swarm you in an instant, often in areas without much space to offer or that are filled with death drops, environmental hazards and crap littering the place which all serves to screw up your mobility. I feel there's also an over-reliance on enemies that simply assault the player with a visual mess of rapid attacks, and quite a lot of very delayed attacks designed to screw with the player's timing. This is interesting when deployed occasionally to mark a difficult enemy, but too much of it made much of the combat a chore to get through. There's also far too much AoE spam in a lot of bosses and mini-bosses (and even just some higher level mobs like Knights). It's completely unnecessary. Combined with the game's length, this all contributed to burn out. I literally cba anymore fighting another AoE spamming Knight with a spear and greatshield that's got a stamina bar longer than the Erdtree is tall.Mounted combat is.funny. Early game it's a real gamechanger. Late game not so much. It just kind of fizzles out because the horse scales very poorly and ends up often being one and two shot by enemies, making it more of a hindrance than a help. I've killed more than a few dragons on foot because I got sick of them blinking an eyelid and knocking me off Torrent.The game has unintentional railroading of playstyles going on as well. What do I mean? I mainly play melee characters, particularly Str/Faith builds. It's served me very well in all the games so far. Here it has crashed and burned. The finest example was a particular boss atop a mountain to the far west (Trying to be vague to avoid spoilers). I couldn t get it past half heath in well over 10 attempts. I decided to re-stat my character into a sorcerer temporarily out of curiosity and killed it on my second attempt with that build. If I had brought one more mana flask I maybe could have done it in my first attempt as a sorceror. I get the impression this game is much easier for INT based builds, which is great for players who like that playstyle. Not so much otherwise, where it s a slogfest.Not sure what they were aiming for with this one, but imo it s falling short of the bar set by DSIII and Bloodborne, and presents much more frustration than it does satisfaction.",0
Negative,bloodborne pc port please,0
Negative,"Redoing the review since I have more experience now.I'll attempt to cover the basics fast.The PvE gameplay is fine for what it is, but comparing it to what came before makes it look atrocious. Every enemy tracks the player's movements so much it might as well make the enemy act like a heat-seeking missile. That includes the bosses. If an enemy has a charge attack, or any attack that seems like it'd go in one direction only, assume in confidence that the attack will curve to hit you. This doesn't even cover how all the enemies that are even slightly agile, even if you're not locked on, always dodge projectile attacks (like magic or arrows).I'll avoid mentioning the weapons, spells and so forth that are overpowered simply because I believe every human has enough brainpower to avoid using them since they can make the game boring. In regards to PvP, it's fucked. While Dark Souls 2 and 3, FROMsoft's previous titles, had PvP in them and they too had some minor things that could be classified as ""Broken"", they still had counters. Elden Ring is heavily skewed in the direction of PvE, so much so that PvP actually feels like a last second implementation. Everything that is overpowered in PvE is doubly so in PvP. There is even the core issue of how the game's netcode is so bad that even if you were to dodge a hit, you'd still get said hit's stats buildup and status use in this game is one of the highest damage dealers, all of them overpowered. If your past experience was Souls 3 then you're in some luck, just imagine every boss as a variation of either Champion Gundyr, Dancer or Nameless King. But remove the boss stamina. Oh and add constant tracking, to the point where you'd wonder if the Starscourge gravity-master gave every other boss lessons on how to manipulate gravity.I can see why the addition of tracking was made, as you're given Spirit Ashes, which are AI-controlled ally versions of enemies you'd encounter in the world, but the problem is that the bosses always track even if you fight them solo.My honest suggestion would be to get any of the dark souls titles over Elden Ring IF you really must have some fromsoft game in your library.",0
Negative,"I looked forward to this for a long time and for a good chunk of the early/mid game it exceeded expectations. I'd love to have put together a solid review for this, especially considering some aspects stay 10/10 (Exploration, environments, atmosphere).Unfortunately I am yet to fully complete the game, due to a drastic decrease in quality and fun. Certain areas of the game increase dramatically in difficulty by significantly buffing enemy health, damage and poise. Many of the enemies and bosses continue to be duplicates of those previously fought, though at times staggeringly powerful compared to the previous areas. Adjusting armour, build and stats does little to mitigate the sheer amount of damage dealt, as even testing with high vigour and some of the heaviest armour available spared me from only a single additional hit. Combined with increasingly frustrating traps, map design and brutal enemy placement (Capital Sewers, Haligtree, Snowfields), the frustration far outpaces any fun that was being had previously. As something of a more personal complaint, there has also been a sharp increase in enemies and bosses with utterly punishing, near nonstop movesteps. I've seen the comparison made and having finished it myself, many of these enemies would feel more at home in Bloodborne, where your evasive and health recovery options work in tandem with a fast, aggressive playstyle.Unfortunately it's looking more and more like I will not finish Elden Ring and it will be the only Fromsoft Souls game to earn that rebuke. My last few sessions have been nothing but frustrating and I've gone back to a much lower level character instead to enjoy the front end. Decisions made in Dark Souls 3 have festered here and it seems as if difficulty for difficulties sake may have been the order of the day. Much of the fairness found in the previous titles is gone, replaced with what feels like pandering to the ""Souls is the hardest"" crowd.I'm open to advice and feedback however much of the front of the game is outstanding and very telling of the skill that's been amassed over the series production. The drop off almost feels blatant and overtuned, as if a shortage of almost perfect skill immediately lumps you in to 'git gud' territory. My disappointment is tangible I'm sure but having sunk so long in to this series and its spin offs, I just didn't expect to bounce off this so hard.",0
Negative,FPS Ring. The game is great with graphics and bosses but HOW TF CAN I BEAT THE TREE WHEN IT'S 30FPS ON MY RTX 3070? BRUH,0
Negative,The game is a great breath to souls with open world and the whole stealth / mounted combat.However it has some major flaw with multiplayer. The constant disconnections. summoning signs bugging out. both invaders and phantoms getting sent home randomly. The very inconsistent fog walling and anti-summoning zones (yes know about bosses locking zones) but it is very odd how it works currently. able to summon people literally in a boss defeated zone (main boss) but unable to summon right in-front of a free roaming one in same exact zone? But able to summon at the dead main zone boss and run to field boss? Again very odd.So until multiplayer is fixed. I just can't give a thumbs-up great game. Review will be updated as it gets patched / fixed.,0
Negative,"While I enjoyed the open world design and think its one of the best souls Fromsoftware created, I really can't recommend this game for coop play. Fromsoft released 5 updates since release including ""online stability fixes"" which did not fix anything. Online feels like russian roulette - one day its working marvelous, the next day you have constant disconnetcs. Out of my 232,5 hours, 40 hours are wasted on trying to fix things and running back to grace for resummoning, of course due to disconnects .on top of that you are getting invaded every 5 min, which is ok. But combined it with disconnects its beyond annyoing.Another negative points:- Boss design is a step back from older souls games - sometimes it feels like I'm playing Devil May Cry- Recycled dungeons - I have nothing against recycled content but only 3-4 various dungeons types in such a big world ?!- Balancing is busted - Bleed build > everything elseI really enjoyed the lore and the world. I loved the magic diversity, the ashes of war and the weapon assortment. I really recommend it for chill solo play with spirit ashes but not so much for coop play.Edit: Port is still shit.",0

Negative,"Elden Ring could be a great game but it's held back by ""difficulty."" The difficulty is your tolerance for being annoyed and enduring obnoxious bullshit like unavoidable damage for almost your entire health bar. It makes the game feel tedious. This is my first legit attempt at a souls game and I just don't care enough to continue. The world and monsters and character building aspects are really good but the game has become so unenjoyable to play I can't force myself to finish it.I got my money's worth and more power to those who enjoy this genre. It's not for me.",0
Negative,"If you like dark souls,specifically dark souls 3, for the feel and look of the gameplay this is the game for you. If you like dark souls for the difficulty outside of boss fights,this game is for you. If you like dark souls for the boss difficulty this game may or may not be for you. The boss fights in this game,for me as many others will have other opinions,are so disconnected from the actual difficulty of a standard souls game. I love the designs and actual boss fights but about half of them are so hard they make dark souls 1-3 and bloodborne look like you are playing my little pony simulated in comparison in terms of difficulty. If I could give a middle review between positive and negative I would as I want people to really choose for themselves if they like it or not. I wouldn't not recommend it but I wouldn't just straight recommend it either. It all depends on the person and what they are looking for.",0
Negative,"Too long, needs too much commitment, lacks the intricate level design previous souls titles had. The dungeons are bland and feels too much like a filler content. NPC quests are still ass as always.One of the major points for me personally is music. The soundtrack as a whole isn't as memorable as previous souls titles. This is a huge let down for me. There are games I play only because I like the music, so this a bit of a personal take.If fromsoft is still persistent on making new open-world souls likes, they have to reconsider these points.I enjoyed the first 20 hours of this game when it still felt fresh. It got stale after understanding that the open-world fromsoft created here lacks any content that makes an open-world enjoyable. There aren't tailor made side quests you can stumble upon, you can only interact with denizens of this bright world with your weaponry. Exploration is rewarded in an unpredictable items you find along the way. (You won't believe where I found a cannon at.)For those who have not played a souls game before, I recommend this. For those who have I stll do, you have been waiting for this. Go and experience it.Although I cannot reccomend this for those who value their time,",0
Negative,"I still hate that steam is limited to a GOOD or BAD rating system, I'm pretty mixed on Elden Ring. The games framework is built on dark souls 3 and every complaint I have about 3 translates to this game. PVP is built on Dark Souls 3 LMAO. Horse Combat sucks ass. Feels like a 40-60 hour game stretched to 80-100 hours. It's not bad but more isn't better especially when level design for the legacy dungeons gets a downgrade. Art Direction is really good. Music is bland only 1 or two themes really stuck out. Co-op while functioning exactly as it always has is now tedious because of the open world. I have to summon my pal we find a cave, de-summon him from my game, i run in to trigger the checkpoint and now we run to the cave on his game just to kick me out and walk though a fog wall is just overall extremely tedious. This game could really benefit from some alternative styled traditional 2 or 4 player lobby system while still maintaining the old formula, but I bet it's due to engine limitations so we get what we get. It's still not impossible to co-op but man is it gonna be a commitment to 100% bro-op a play through Compared to even DaS 3 were if you both know the game you can finish it in 1-2 weekends. No way is this game a 10/10 you are under some crazy delusions if you think so. Overall it's still a solid game and better then most AAA crap that gets pushed out nowadays.Overall 7.5/10IMO From Souls games rated with all DLC, as of right now Elden Ring has none and this ranking might change laterDaS 1 = BB > DeS > ER >> DaS 2 >>>>>> DaS 3 (Sekiro is not a souls game, frick off Randy.)",0

Negative,"Elden Ring is a great game, I love the environment, interesting world and the assorted array of boss battles. It is a souls game and more, so why the negative review?Input lag. At first I thought maybe I am just being bad, but as I kept going into the game I noticed that there is always a slight delay after I push my button before I actually start rolling, so I adjust by dodging sooner and then I end up eating attacks anyway because now it's too soon and everyone and their mother punishes that. I have come to the conclusion that this game is more of a predictive game than a reactive game, that means that I would have to actually purposefully ignore what my gut senses are telling me - which really messes me up.imagine a counter puncher who sees a moment for a counter but their body simply won't move fast enough to actually pull it off.I will still finish the game since I bought it, but if I had known sooner I would have skipped this game because this sort of delay was not in any of the previous souls games I have played and I find the idea of having quick reaction time be punished rather unacceptable",0
Negative,Where is the Arabic language support? There have been statements from the developer to support the Arabic language and now it is not present in the final product,0
Negative,"for what its worth, ill start by saying the game ran at a rock-solid 60fps (all my monitor can push) at 4k and max settings. so, im not sure what everyone is complaining about as far as performance goes. the joy of pc gaming, i guess. none of the other weirdness ive seen mentioned either, other than ugly shadows. so if you were put off by the fear of it running badly, take heart that it does work just fine for some people, so maybe give it a shot and it will work for you?that said. i refunded. its just boring. like deathly dull. an hour in, i was so bored i quit to play something else for a while. came back to it, forced my way through another half hour, and finally decided. nope. not happening. it just never grabbed me. its beautiful, and its probably the first soulslike i was ever able to actually kill anything in, but it feels so empty and directionless. i love open world games, but id like to have the tiniest bit of direction just do i dont feel like im wandering around aimlessly. something a bit more than golden rays i guess. i could do without the absurdity of the icon-salad in games like far cry, but a few scattered dots or something, to indicate 'maybe going this way wont be a total waste of your time' would be very welcome.i can get how some people would really dig this game, and maybe youll dig it too, but personally? its a hard pass.",0
Negative,"The game was a mess on launch. Several game break bugs, glitching into the environment, enemies and bosses disappearing mid fight, 4 of the 10 sidequests were bugged, a whole character was missing, balance was way off. Luckily years later that has mostly been fixed but the worst ray tracing has been added that barely changes the visuals while eating up performance. Still no DLSS, no high frame rates caps at 60fps, still has some hitching issues, HDR hit or miss might look good or be completely washed out, no HDR in borderless window, no HUD rescaling, and many other common PC options are still missing.First I would recommend play DS1, DS3, Nioh 2, or Lies of P. All those are better tighter experiences. If you've beaten all of those then sure get Elden Ring. It is basically DS4 by another name but as a 'new' franchise it sadly doesn't really expand the gameplay formula anymore and reuses tons from their previous games.Personally felt the open world was the worst part of the game and added nothing to the experience. Shrink the map by 50-70% and it would have only improved it. Almost every boss is repeated at least once (sometimes 5-6 times), tons of repeated enemies and bosses from past souls games, the duplication of the catacombs shows they had nothing to really fill that open world with. The DLC also has suffered from similar reuse issues despite taking over two year to create. Have a review on that as well. I think From has some serious issues that are only present in Elden Ring and not in any of their games before it.",0

Negative,"I put about 80 hours into this game, and I did have fun throughout that time; however, I can't recommend the game in good conscience.The game wasn't bad, but it definitely wasn't for me. I love Dark Souls 1, Dark Souls 3 (2 is okay, just not for me either), and Bloodborne. I would go so far to say that two of those title compete for my favorite game of all time. Those are the games that set my expectations for Elden Ring, and I initially thought it would stack up well.The reason it fell flat for me really comes down to the open world. The devs are FromSoft did really well with the open world. The open world itself isn't bad, but it actually made me want to explore less than I would in any other From title. It probably didn't help that the map literally points me where I need to go next to progress. Sure, I didn't have to follow it, but I found myself just blazing through the main game in under 65 hours. The other time was spent helping out players by summoning for boss fights (an old Souls tradition for me). Now I have no real reason to play.I spent hundreds of hours in other From games, but most of that time came from the joy of doing new runs with different builds, doing runs for all endings, and doing runs with different friends. Even though the mechanics are at an all-time great in this game, I have no desire to go through the game again. It feels like a chore to do a run where I can't spend the time exploring everything again like I typically do in other From games. Sure, I could just respec and move on to keep exploring, but it just isn't that interesting to me anymore. I like the tighter experience of other From games, as I am able to completely immerse myself in every experience the game has to offer over and over again as I watch myself gain mastery over navigating the world, the mechanics, and the lore.This game, in my opinion, is just too much. There tons of great stuff in here, and I am sure this kind of experience jives with a lot of people. It just misses the mark for me. It feels like the game crushes itself under its own weight and removes what I found most enjoyable in From titles.",0

Negative,"lazy. - same 3 enemies constantly rehashed for bossfights- higher enemy hp and damage = difficult apparently- no focus whatsoever on learning boss patterns, just a dps check- pvp is a similar deal; no dodging, no finesse, no gameplay, just a dps check and lame meta strats (expected while invading, trashy in duels). it actually makes me miss ds3.- fs constantly nerfing cheese strats, and kicking people in the nuts for wanting to bypass atrocious poorly designed garbage- see: godskin duo, malenia, commander dude in castle sol whose name i completely forgot. oh, speaking of.- forgettable. just forgettable. you might think that this is probably because most bossfights consist of common enemies, but no; OST is extremely sucky except for a few tracks, a lot of bosses seem visually spectacular but then do jack shit while you're fighting them (or they're just straight up violently annoying, like elden beast or malenia).- spirit ashes are nice, i guess. atleast they would be if they had any thought put into them whatsoever. let's be honest, you're just gonna use mimic tear / black knife tiche / dungeater; you are lying to yourself if you think otherwise.- exploration is good, legacy dungeons are nice i guess, but catacombs get repetitive really fast. if you've seen 3 of them you've seen them all. also hero graves are an example of the worst fromsoft level design to date.- the horse fucking blows. horrible, janky, delayed controls. obnoxious jumping. that would be tolerable if there weren't so many platforming segments/shortcuts, but alas. - ash of war system is nice, except most of them just suck- twinkling titanite (or somber smithing stone, whatever) distribution was made by a mentally handicapped 5 month old chimpanzee; you can get a +9 stone much easier and faster than, say, a +7 one. - extremely easy to miss quests. this is, of course, a fs staple; important quest NPCs dying because you passed some arbitrary area threshold. dialogue doesn't help much either, it's still just cryptic garbage.

Negative,"The game is amazing.if you can ignore all the ways it isn't. The short version, after 300+ hours, beating the game, and going for (almost) all the achievements is: it's an unbalanced mess that caters only to very specific types. For example: If you want to focus on sorceries, good luck, as you'll have maybe 3 viable spells that you'll end up spamming for the entire game, and the occasional rare opening for a flask + azure comet against a boss. The rest of the spells in the game are a joke, most have a casting radius that extends barely beyond melee range and do laughable damage to FP cost, and several of the weapons in the game outperform all sorceries(Google Sacred Relic Sword, or Bolt of Gransax, literally both have far greater range than any spell in the game, cost less FP to use, do more damage scaling, and are faster to use/set up by simply tapping L2) Sorcery is absolutely pointless after you clear the rare meme moment of 'one-shotting' a boss in the early game.If you stray from the meta/bleed builds, you'll have a bad time. There is a MASSIVE difficulty spike right around the snow region where all of the sudden every enemy hits like a fucking truck and even with 50+ vigor you're still getting killed in 1-2 hits by damned near everything. Fights aren't hard because the AI is complex and tricky, it's because everything you fight is just blasting you with instant-kill AoE spam or volleys of arrows or just plain ganking you to hell. NG+ doesn't feel like a reward at the end of a journey, it feels like a punishment for finally escaping the hell that is the end game areas.And don't even get me started on invasions. Once again the Souls community proves just how rancid it can be when you are genuinely trying to enjoy an open world game with your friend or loved one or actually trying to get help to overcome a challenge, but nope, some nolife jerk shows up with an arsenal of weapons specifically tailored for hindering your progress and wasting your time for their own amusement.I really, truly wanted to love this and give it a great review, but I can't.",0
Negative,I want to like it but I just haven't been able to get into it.,0
Negative,"Elden Ring is consistently inconsistent.As of review time, I have two ending achievements left, so I have already seen much of what the game has to offer. And what that game has to offer is disappointing. I do want to mention that I have enjoyed Elden Ring somewhat, however.Let s start off first with what I liked. The open world has so many secrets and houses so many things to do. So many optional areas with optional bosses to fight with a ton of loot. The gameplay at a fundamental level is the best it s ever been in souls, with quality higher than Bloodborne and more weapon variety than DS2. The game is a spectacle to watch: the open world looks great, even on lower settings, and the bosses are a spectacle, with perfect transitions from cutscene to gameplay. Take Godrick s fight: the transformation starts with him grafting the dragon head, and when you regain control, the dragon head is raised aloft, just like in the cutscene. So much attention to detail is present in this game.But what happens when the game is just not fun? The boss design is, no joke, the worst in the series. I found only two bosses memorable for the boss fights themselves: Pre-nerf Rahdan and Melania. Rahdan before the nerf is surprisingly doable, and you fight him at such an open point in the game that it feels like your supposed to fight him after the Capital, which I did on my first playthrough. If only his damaged was nerfed, I would consider him just a fight you take on earlier, which is fine, but his attacks are so slow now that on my second playthrough I killed him without taking damage on like my second or third attempt.Melania is tough, unreasonably tough, but that s for a good reason: she is a postgame fight. She should be the last thing players should do, and as she is postgame, she is completely optional. You are supposed to look for cheese. As the player has played the game up to this point, they have so many tools and respecs available that you are supposed to try different things. I personally used Rykard s sword along with Mimic Tear which made the fight significantly easier. Very fun fight and very rewarding. Morgott s fight is also really fun, fast paced and without too much cheapness.Outside of these few bosses, though, I felt like the remaining bosses were just not fun. No boss showcases this like the Fire Giant.Holy shit, did FromSoftware have a meeting to design the worst boss in any game I have played in recent memory? Because that s what it feels like they did. Fire Giant showcases tons of major problems with Elden Ring, and putting all of these together creates a mountain of shit. The boss is too fuckin big The boss has too much AOE The boss doesn t give enough opportunities to attack relative to the size of the health bar The boss is faster than SonicAnother issue with many other bosses is that there doesn t seem to be a limit on how many times it can use an attack. I have had the Draconic Tree Sentinel spit fire close to 10 times, preventing approach to the boss for at least 15-20 seconds. The boss fights feel like they are dragging themselves out to a massive degree, making them even more painful. Many of the bosses in this game I never want to fight again after putting down the game, something that I have never felt outside of Izalith in a FromSoft game before. The amount of shit bosses increases drastically as you reach the end, essentially meaning that I probably won t ever complete another playthrough of this game ever again.There are many more problems with Elden Ring, more than I care to write for this review. If you want more Souls and have finished every other game, then give this game a shot. It is pretty much Dark Souls 4, anyways. But if you have DS3 or Demon s Souls or Bloodborne sitting on your shelf, I recommend playing those games instead.",0

Negative,"I think this game is likely really good if you're already familiar with soulslikes and enjoy them. As someone who never played a soulslike before and bought into the hype, I really didn't get it. I felt like I was dropped into an open world with no direction, nowhere to go, no idea what I was doing, no *reason* to do anything (the story seemed to almost be an on-the-nose parody of every fantasy trope you could imagine; made me take the entire thing unseriously from the get go) and anywhere I did go, I'd just die immediately. It felt really frustrating and like no matter what I did, I'd just die. If it were at least linear I'd know I was somewhere I was supposed to be. Do I suck at this game? Absolutely. If you've never played a soulslike either, I'd say you should be cautious before buying into the hype like I did on this one. It might not be for you. It doesn't help that I experienced some stuttering even on lower graphics, and felt the controls were somewhat unituitive at first. The UI and Keybinding menus were actually abysmal, straight back to the 90s, which is honestly pretty unacceptable. I know tons of people love this game, and most of my friends do, but I just don't get it.",0
Negative,"""Most overrated & hyped up by people who hate the fact that GTA and Assassin's Creed are more popular""What specs you need to run it 60fps - 1080p or 4K, without stutter or lag?- Honest answer is that, no matter how good your PC is, no matter, if you have PS5, this game will perform horribly and only thing you can do is wait for multiple patches.97 by critics? What!? Riding a horse in an open world with bad graphics and old textures isn t innovative. This game feels like they threw DS 3 in a blender and added some new bosses. Why this gets so much praise I don t know. Compared to Horizon Forbidden West (which has a lot of new and improved things, great story and great characters) this game is a big joke.This game goes into same category of games, that have been extremely overhyped and extremely underdelivered. Other examples would be ""Cyberpunk 2077"", ""Fallout 76"", ""Anthem"", ""Battlefield 2042"" and ""Elden Ring"" is another fine addition to that list.Game controls are dog sh*t, pretty much forces you to play with a controller.

This port is worse than cyberjunk, and I hope I get my refund for this game.",0
Negative,"A pretty good and very disappointing game that could have been great. The rock-solid level design of their previous games is abandoned for an open world that adds very little to the experience and ends up being mostly empty fields and copy-paste dungeons that almost all have the same 3-4 enemy types for the entire game and usually end with a lazy boss and an unsatisfying reward. This problem is not that bad at the beginning but gets worse the longer you go.The Souls-like levels are good but they are few and far between and some of them are very, very short. The last 1/3 or so of the game is extremely boring and the enemy variety is stretched beyond its limit with only one or two new enemy types for 15+ hours of gameplay. So the areas and levels end up being filled with the same exact enemies you've been fighting for the rest of the game but this time they take forever to kill and they are put in packs.The bosses of ER are easily the worst in the series, there are a handful of good ones like Mohg and Morgott but you have to slog through an ocean of low-effort trash boss fights to get to them which kills the game's replay value. The boss variety is also extremely lacking, having you fight several bosses over and over and over again, and sometimes they just throw two random bosses into a room or put random mobs next to a boss you've already fought and call it a new boss fight. Even the shardbearers aren't safe from being shamelessly recycled.On the technical side, this is a very poor PC port with a 60fps cap and more than occasional stutters. And the input queue for game actions is atrocious.It's pretty good and better than most open world games but doesn't live up to their past works. I'd give it a mixed rating if I could but I can't so not recommended will have to do. Might play it more for multiplayer but this is EASILY the worst Fromsoft game.",0
Negative,"So what a disappointment of a pc port. I know this was not going to be good but I did not think it was going to be as bad as dark souls one.The game has massive constant stutters on most pc low to high endThere are some workarounds to improve or even fix the stuttering but for me even with all the fixes the game still stutters. All stutters and lack of ultrawide support and higher than 60fps needs to be fixed before I can recommend this game.This game should have been delayed another month on pc. From the research that I have done it looks like the cracked version of this game runs 25-30 percent better on most gpus and has a lot less stutter or none for many users. Also no ultrawide support and locked to 60fps in 2022 is unacceptable. Exceptional when it took a moder less then a day to add ultrawide support, and arbitrary fps above 60. From Software needs to add these features, as these fixes makes it so you can't play the game in online mode do to them using EasyAntiCheat. Will there most likely be a work around in the future maybe as it depends on how far the modding community wants to take it but there is a good chance that the mod will have to be constantly updated with when more patches for elden ring are released. The general performance of this game on the gpu is also not good as with the given visual the game uses 20-30 percent more gpu resources then it should. At all resolutions.Also any reviewer that was not completely transparent about performance of this game and any other game should not be taken seriously. The job as a reviewer is to inform the consumer on a product and if that product does not work correctly that needs to be stated.About the console version of Elden from what people have been telling me and what I have researched is most consoles do not have the stuttering issue. The less than great experience on console because of the terribly highly variable frame rate that does not make any sense given the resolution and the power of the ps5 and XSX. I feel that From Software needs to work hard on both the pc version in terms of basic features that are missing and stuttering. But on consoles they need to work on general optimization of the game at the resolutions that it targets should not be dropping below 60fps on the consoles. At this point I think all Japanese games should be ported to PC by credible porting companies like NIXXIES. I know that even there ports have had some issues but they are still leagues better than 99 percent of Japanese PC ports. I am sorry but they have proven that they do not know what a Computer is.I will update this Port Review when all issues are fixed.The New Update made the game not even launch on my pc. 1.0.2.1",0

Negative,"fucking 80h played, now file is corruped, please resolve this fucking issue",0
Negative,"Okay. 100 hours in and I honestly cannot recommend this game. It's been a repetitive cycle that every latest release has been one disappointment after another and while I clearly have been enjoying this game and would love to give a praised rating for all the content and amount of time I've put into this I simply cannot ignore all the issues and blaring laziness provided by FromSoftware. To start off and just get this out of the way because it has been proven as a fact. PC version of this game runs poorly compared to console versions. And yes I have had multiple FPS issues, crashes, bugs, and lost of 8 an hour save due to these issues. You can check my account and see the pictures I have posted of some outfits simply not displaying and some crashing my game. This is not acceptable for any game and I know given any other developer we'd all be pitch forks raging about how unacceptable this is and I refuse to give Fromsoftware a pass simply because this is just their ""Bethesda tradition"". Combat. To keep it simple, it's fun an addictive. There are multiple weapons to use and lots of varieties you can use those weapons, you can unlock these Ash of War things that let you swing your weapon in crazy ways and let you mask them with crazy power ups like fire, ice, lightning, poison, blood loss, dragon, death, holy. I can't give as much credit as I'd love to give the combat because my entire gameplay has been using a greatsword with shield and using the same repetitive style of hold LT for fire, than swing after for a stagger and repeat for the next 14 swings until the boss dies. And even towards the end it started to become a milked down cycle of upgrading strength and just brute forcing a boss in a corner because it was the quickest way of dealing with anything without much risk. I've watched my friends play and use different weapons and each had their own play-style that was just as rewarding as the one I was using. A friend of mine uses a Katana I had given her and she slashes with blood loss, another uses magical abilities, and another had an extremely broken ability where you just press a button and Kamehameha the enemy. Truly there's a lot of choices here to pick from and different styles for anyone to enjoy.World. The world is massive and beautiful while dreadful at times. Each new place I had discovered felt like I was truly stepping into an area worth 6-7 hours of content to find and look for any items that I could collect or abilities I could stash up. One of my favorite areas is very late game and I found myself spending a lot of time just siting around because i enjoyed the scenery and snowy mountains . There's a bunch of caves, hidden portals, and elevators that just take you to all sorts of places and each one feels rewarding to explore. Story. A lot of games try to shove a lot of dialogue down my throat with little context of what's actually going on. One of my favorite things about this game is that it didn't hold my hand to where I needed to be. You sit down on a Rise and a little arrow points you. That's it. Some NPC's give dialogue and offer information, some simply don't say anything. One of the greatest feelings about this game is that the story and source material for where I needed to go didn't even come from the game, it came from a friend messaging me on discord saying ""Hey have you found this yet?"" or ""You should go here"" only to get invaded and be rewarded with a fight a weapon/armor I'd later consider using. Truly I don't really know what's going on, I know there are these Elden Gods you need to kill or whatever but I just killed everything in my way including Npcs because my entire goal was to become a Dark Edgy Teen Lord for the sake of getting the worst ending possible. Okay. Where to start on my rant? While I loved all the things I listed above, I also quickly came to hate them.World. This has got to be one of the most barren, uninteresting, uninspired, and lazy worlds I have ever come to experience in an open world game. After the 40 hour mark your lust for exploration will come to a complete halt and you quickly find out that every little cave and every little boss adds no value whatsoever to your playstyle. Bosses are unbalanced and can quickly spike up from difficulty for no reason. I've had more difficulty fighting some bosses in caves than I have fighting the main bosses of the story. While also completely destroying a boss with 2 hits while the area he is presented in is complete bullshit to even get to. After exploring 4 caves you'll come to quickly find out you've practically explored every cave. There is limited amount of variation, bosses are duplicated in the masses and you'll come across the same dude in about 4 different caves with a tiny bit more plot armor in the next cave. This is literally the definition of Quantity over Quality. Mobs. A lot of these mobs really feel uninspired and at times have no idea where they are suppose to belong. Around the mages area you'll come across these big hands that look pretty creepy, well these hands also exist in another location of the map that has nothing to do with magic. Why? I assume they ran out of ideas and decided ""put this mob here to fill the empty space"". Not only do mobs feel uninspired and look generic as they possibly can get, a lot of them look slightly altered from the last one, I kid you not one of the main bosses Godrick, looks exactly like another main boss. I stated this before with my group of friends and it's the mindset I will continue to have with this game. I enjoyed Sekiro, and I felt like every boss was designed with the mindset of having a great battle, and then designing the boss around said battle style. Here? It feels like every boss was designed to look a specific way and than they decided to give said boss a specific move set that they'll likely spam for the next 3 minutes. Ontop of spamming a lot of mobs have zero cooldown so they are able to just sit there in tight corners spamming the exact same move over and over. Online. if your online system doesn't work, don't release it. Simple as that. I've had so many issues with Online that I know every other single player has had the exact same issue. If your online feature doesn't work, don't make it a feature. If my matches aren't bumper cars or ice skating enemies, it's a constant DC followed by crash. Combat/Online. While the combat in Singleplayer can be fun and diverse with a lot of room to explore what you'd like to use online combat comes down to stats and what happens to be the biggest cheese move to keep your enemy in kiting distance while still demonstrating how large of a dingus you have. Seriously, did anyone even test or try to balance out the amount of weapons in this game? Bloodloss is easily one of the most overrated and highly effective abilities in the game, I can't even blame the player for using it considering how good it is because even I had my fare share of broken abilities I just sat on because there was no need for improvement or change. But holy shit there are just so many broken abilities and weapons in this game that quickly take the fun out of any sort of actual combat. Finally I'd like to say I really did enjoy this game. Even considered starting a new character, travel a different path, and explore a lot of the choices I chose to ignore my first time around. But coming close to the end, I don't care to explore anything else in the world. I know there are a lot of bosses I've yet to do on my own (I've watched friends on discord do them) I just plainly don't care. The reward is so minimal and not worth my effort when it will just sit in my stash. I know I'm going to get a lot of clown emotes from the schellers trying to justify their 60$ purchase. So thanks for the points.",0

Negative,"Overall, kind of a mixed bag. I wanted to give it a thumbs up, but there are definitely a lot of caveats that prevent me from fully endorsing it.Pro: Huge Beautiful World to ExploreCon: .but a lot of it uses recycled content, or is just kind of empty.Pro: Tons of different weapons and spells and tools to play around withCon: .but the balance is kind of shit, so using the things you like might be making the game way harder than you want it to be.Pro: Classic Souls game combat with a number of refinements to the mechanics to give you more options.Con:.but a lot of the enemies have extremely cheap patterns, crazy attack tracking, and questionable hitboxes that make it hard to feel like it's your fault when you lose. Bosses in the late game are particularly cheesy, with very little visible counterplay. You either get lucky, or you cheese them right back.Pro: Some really cool NPCs with more interesting questlines than the Souls games typically have.Con: .but the hugeness of the open world makes a lot of them really hard to track down when they don't always tell you where they're heading to, so you can easily miss connections and lose questlines if you're not following a guide.So, yeah. I've enjoyed a lot of my time with the game, but I think the scale of it has done a lot of harm to the more precision elements of the formula. I kind of miss the more refined gameplay of Sekiro where everything meshed together nicely. This feels a lot sloppier by comparison. I realize the addition of all the RPG mechanics and the size of the game both add a lot of complication to the balancing process, but I still think it could be better.",0

Negative,"Phenomenal game, and I'd say its quite literally what what DS II wanted to be. Mini boss after mini boss after mini boss-but it does it in a way that doesn't make your body produce more melatonin.Unfortunately, I can't recommend though until they fix the performance issues. My laptop 3060 isn't by any means ""super high end"" but it IS significantly more powerful than what this game recommends and doesn't even having trouble games recommending significantly higher specs.I can assure you after attempting every fix on the internet I don't think I will be seeing a stable 60 fps when I'm not in a dungeon, and I'm definitely going to die another 100 times to the game stuttering out of nowhere.This is not saying you will feel like you're emulating the game on a shit box, as for I've had a very manageable 50-60 fps consistently out in the open world for some good 10 minute increments-but there is always another stutter around the corner, and always in the WORST timing possible.I'm sure if your PC is built like an absolute tank you won't experience these things, though if your PC is anywhere in the range of the minimum specs - slightly above the recommended, expect problems for now.Play at your own risk, the optimization adds its own element of rage that these games never had before.",0

Negative,"Overall i love this game, it definitely has its issues but the positives outweigh the negatives. The creativity and scale of the game is crazy! but the targeting system is so bad and the game has a very awkward menu system that just wastes your time a lot. Also there is so much wasted time, when it comes to really hard bosses they put the spawn point like 5 mins of running away for literally no reason which is kind of annoying. But overall this game is definitely worth getting!",0
Negative,"Great game and definitely worth the money. With all the things there is to see and do you'll be surely sinking tons of hours into this game. However, the multiplayer is horrible. Multiplayer is designed horribly, almost like the devs tried to not let you have fun in co-op. Invasions and duels in this game are really bad too since everyone is using the most op builds and there is no pre-existing etiquette other than not using heals mid-fight. If you only want this game to play with friends or play pvp it's not worth it. If you want it for the singleplayer experience then it's a must have, just turn off online mode. You won't miss anything other than troll messages and mirrors of people phasing in and out randomly.",0
Negative,"Ok game, but the worst souls so far. It is just not balanced to play as a melee build without summons.In my 1200h in other souls games I was able to do all bosses with dagger in my hand and my ability to roll. This game is nothing like previous ones in this aspect. The amount of aggression bosses have with 12 hit combos after which we still cannot punish, because some of them have no recovery, and thats assuming that boss is in melee range when not attacking, because they usually jump back. Stopping mid combo to perform heal punish attack if you dare to touch the estus button. Undodgeable attacks if not spaced at spear range 100% of time, a lot of one shots that need to be rolled or jumped frame perfect and many more. It just pushes you to use op summons, and op ashes of war againts unfair bosses. Not exactly my way to have fun.Hopefully pvp gets balanced sometime in the future, then this review will turn positive. At this moment ppl just spam current meta ashes of war and spells.",0

Negative,"DarkSouls (1 and 3) were incredible for the interaction with the enemy: the attacks were intuitive and the death wasn't frustrating because it felt like my fault. Now with Elden Ring a few things got better: the setting and the RPG component were improved while the things that made the dungeon-crawling part fun were left with little to no attention. Attack timings are all over the place, especially in the DLC the damage/resistance is poorly balanced and the worst part of all is the technical part of the game: FPS are unstable to say the least, the multiplayer has a significant latency (up to seconds) and to top it all off we are forced to use EasyAntiCheat that is useless if not detrimental for the already poor performances.",0

I would absolute give this an 8-9/10 IF IT WASNT FOR THE LAG!Omg the lag is extremely annoying. It happens at the absolute worst times, and at times when nothing is going on and makes the game annoying to play.Devs, fix the freaking lag for the love of god please fix the lag.I am not recommending this game until the lag issue is fixed.

It's simply unacceptable to launch products in this state and there is no way they didn't know.,0
Negative,"I love the game. I think it'll be my GOTY. Exploration and lore are fantastic. The journey to the bosses is the best they've done of any game probably.Giving it a thumbs down for the late game spike in difficulty though. Bosses jumped constantly, and unless you pumped in 58 vigor you were probably going to get one shot by most of their moveset, even the basic stuff. For NG+ that'd be alright but for NG its just not in line with the previous games FromSoft has made. Issues like enemies attacking through certain (but not all) walls and objects are still here, after a decade of making Souls games.The final boss can straight up freeze and hand you victory. One of the final bosses has a nonsensical attack where they wedge an axe into the ground and stomp into it to cause a linear quake, the silly thing being he can turn and track you while it is wedged into the ground like he's aiming a rifle at you. Input lag still plagues the game and while it can be reduced, it never goes away. If things like this got past QA I don't think they play tested the later stuff much.If you don't plan on finishing it then maybe it'd be good to buy on sale after it's gotten patched more. Also I hope you like slow/staggered attacks because every single boss and a lot of normal enemies have them as a big part of their moveset.",0

Negative,"ELDEN RING is too inconsequent to be fun.The game forces you to find the information about it outside of the game. You can easily miss important characters and items which are easy to obtain and meant to be found as they unlock basic parts of the gameplay. The problem is that once you miss something and you know or feel it the game makes nothing to make you closer to your target. You see the locked crafting button, and it is meant to be unlocked quickly but you will have no idea how to do it if you will miss a point of interest near the starting location. You can find a summoning spell and you will have no idea why it is not working. The same story repeats with the magic spells.These problems intensify unpleasant gameplay based on acquiring items, scattered around the world which you find randomly or just learn their locations outside of the game.The game aslo lacks quality. You keep watching the gamepad key hints while you play on mouse and keyboard. When you buy new items, you can not compare their characteristics with the existing ones. Some boss animations are unclear: you can not guess which parts the boss uses to deal damage during these animations.Well, some bossfights are fun to learn and play, but the game could be better.",0
Negative,"this game does a lot of cool stuff but fromsoft also just kinda took out their whole bag of tricks and shoved them everywhere and it's legitimately tiresome. Every single room in a catacomb will have an enemy hiding in the corner to catch you from behind. Every item in plain sight has a guy staring at it waiting to hit you because you didn't check your corners. Every time you try to heal in a fight it feels like the game instantly reads your input and the enemy leaps or straight up teleports to you because you didn't press the heal button within 5 frames of them finishing one particular attack that has enough recovery time for you to do so safely. So many bosses and enemies just don't let up for a single second and the game is so poorly balanced past Liurnia I never know if a random footsoldier's short sword is gonna hit me for 50 or 500 damage. It feels like you just aren't allowed to make more than 2 mistakes in an encounter unless you have a tank build focusing on damage reduction and 40+ vigor. So much of the design in this game feels like the devs are just constantly trying to ""get"" me with some cheap garbage they cooked up or by making the game more ""difficult"" by pumping up damage numbers or making enemies that do insane chain attacks that come with no tell and kill you in half a second.I wish instead of doing that the devs tried to make the game fun.

While I enjoyed my time playing it, I honestly wouldn't recommend it to others unless they enjoy metaphorically banging their heads against walls like me.First the good, exploration is pretty good - some of the best I've ever seen. If you enjoy just wandering an open world, you will find some enjoyment here. I fear the main game-play aspects will however ruin your experience.The combat mechanics in PVE and PVP are rather lackluster with few explanations of what and/or why of the mechanics. Websites are pretty good at explaining the counter-intuitive elements - for example, status build-up on dodge in PVP, or Fia's hugs affecting total health with no obvious messaging. In general this lack of documentation/explanations is a repeat pattern in the game. You can mitigate this through online research, but be prepared to spend time reading up on the jank.Weapons do have cool and interesting attack chains, but you'll never see them as you play - the way poise works most enemies will attack you through your attacks. Enemies have long chains of attacks that break up the flow of PVE combat. The ash-of-war system is interesting, but limited - your allowed 1 unique skill(sometimes 2 with stance ash)?. Unless you place constraints on yourself as you play it's rather easy to craft builds with exploit aspects of combat, abuse spirit ashes, abuse sorceries/incants, spam ash of wars. The combat is janky and lacking - it's up to the player to reassemble enjoyment from it.The plot seems rather underdeveloped at time. Quest-lines oftentimes end with a confusing ""Wait, why did you die?"" moment. And the main plot will leave you with many questions if you try to understand it. Again websites and YouTube do a good job of supplementing, but ultimately, the creator content while good guess work - is still guess work with holes due to the source materials detached story telling.Ultimately, if you enjoy metaphorically banging your head against walls like me, you can find enjoyment in this game. For my friends that I've met - I would not recommend this game as a good/enjoyable use of their time. There are better, more complete, games out there.",0
Negative,"Please fix the performance, and some UW support would be great once you manage to get it to not stutter at 1080p on a 2070 Super :)Edit: Finished the game, performance on the penultimate final boss is horrible and it never got any better until I dropped the settings. Not to mention the final boss is just boring as hell.Game is okay, wont play again. Got my money's worth but I wish it ended at the capital. The game is as hard as you want it to be, pro tip, stop listening to people who don't go outside; level vigour to at least 45 preferably 60.",0
Negative,"Bad hitboxes, bad gameplay design, bosses are pure aoe attacks, world is empty, everything is a oneshot. Dont waste your money.",0
Negative,not as good as sekiro:shadow die twice,0
Negative,"Nice Ctrl+C Ctrl+V(no)AGAINDemon's Souls is better. If you've played their games long enough, this is obvious.",0
Negative,"Didn't like this game at all.I think in order to like it, you have to have played some souls games before. Nothing is explained - controls, items, combat, what your goals are, how gear works, what you're supposed to do, how to get better etc.Also had some audio issues.",0
Negative,the story is good difficulty is fine but the controls are so fucking inconsistent that it feels like im constantly fighting against them. On top of that the game is plagued by serious bugs that cannot be overlooked. To be clear i love this game but it needs some work before i can recommend it to anyone. P.S. this review was made after i beat the game and played into newgame plus,0
Negative,"Holy crap this game is overrated.- everything about the questing is awful. - getting around the map is a PAIN IN THE ASS. It doesn't really even feel like an open world game. Everything's too high or too low, and you can't climb or glide or anything to make it easier.- there's NOTHING fun about having to run for 2 minutes just to get back to the bosses you keep dying to- spend 20 minutes fighting a boss to be one-hit THROUGH A WALL cause you didn't drink a flask for that 10% of health you're missing- performance is STILL bad, no surprise- controls are awful (is this a part of the challenge?)- need option to toggle zooming in with bows- need custom loadout presets for when I have to change my whole loadout because a certain boss demands it (HOW is this NOT a feature?)",0
Negative,"An actual marvel of a game, it's a shame half of it has been spent getting kill by the notorious frame-skipping.This Game seems to really shit on any CPU that predates an 8th gen Intel processor, game runs beautifully on a 6800k, but the frame-skipping is just absolutely insufferable during combat segments.",0
Negative,"Originally my review said ""My favorite game of all time, now, and forever.""That was around the first 1/3rd of the game for me, and I truly meant that. Unfortunately when I got about half way through all the content in the game, the later half of the game really did not feel anywhere near as fun as the first. Extremely tanky enemies you'd already fought at the start of the game chunking you despite having heavy armor and 2k health. Copy pasted bosses on multiple occasions. Incredibly unfun areas that you can't even stop to enjoy the look of because you are constantly punished for not simply running by nearly everything. and don't even get me started on the final boss. Gorgeous, yes, but feels horrible to fight. Despite there being 6 endings, 4 of them are recolored versions of each other with one line (out of five lines) of dialogue changed and nothing else. The NPCs? Best in the series for the most part, tons of them, and despite that nearly every single one of their questlines ends in their death. I had really hoped Fromsoft had moved past this tired and unsatisfying practice, but no, they haven't. Even the extreme few who do manage to survive their quests end up shells of their former selves, assuming their content wasn't actively cut from the game (Looking at you, Nepheli and Kenneth.)My honest recommendation is to buy the game yourself if you've ever enjoyed Soulslike games or games like Breath of the Wild, on sale if you have too, but don't let the hype ruin your expectations for the entirety of the game. It's still a Fromsoft game at the end of the day. Also, don't bother doing any ending that isn't blue witch girl or madness. You will be left deeply unsatisfied.",0
Negative,"The game is fun, but there's one huge, fundamental flaw that drags down the whole experience.The camera is garbage. No option to turn off the camera panning to center while moving means you're always fighting it while mounted (and even on foot), making mounted combat a chore and exploration a nausea-inducing mess. Lock-on and camera reset being the same button causes problems when enemies are slightly behind obstacles or the camera isn't panned far enough toward the target to recognize the lock.I will change my review if there is an option added to turn off automatic camera panning.",0
Negative,"People who keep calling this game a masterpiece are liars.If I were to describe this game in one word it would be schizophrenic. The difficulty is schizophrenic. It s not a question of getting gud this time around. Having defeated every boss, in every From Software game since Demon s Souls up until and now including Elden Ring and having played most of these titles on consoles with a gamepad and on PC with mouse and keyboard I have gotten gud quite a while ago but in this game the difficulty can jump from almost impossible to braindead depending on your build and the amount of farming/exploration you have done. While true for most From Software games it s especially egregious in this one. You can go from dying dozens of times to a boss in one playthrough to making a mentally and physically handicapped fool out of him in a different one. Not because of your skills improving, mind you, but due to the tools used and levels farmed.The overall quality is schizophrenic. It can go from about an 8/10 to a 2/10 seemingly at random and with little room for mediocrity inbetween. Mainly due to taking both the best ideas and technology from the previous titles as well as the absolute dumbest ones.What s good then? Some of the bosses are abolutely amazing (Radagon, Malenia, Maliketh, Godskin Apostle when fought on his own, Godskin Noble when fought on his own). These are the fights that take what was good about From s games and make it even better.Most of the hitboxes are just wonderfulThe variety in builds and the amount of options presented to the player is really astonishing.The soundtrack is just as good as in previous title though personally I didn t find most of it to be all that memorable.And what s bad?Most of the bosses. In the vein of Dark Souls II a baffling amount of bosses in this game are repeated assets: Erdtree Avatars, Godskins, Red Wolves, Gargoyles, Tibia Mariners, Tree Sentinels, Ulcerated Tree Spirits, Omenkillers, Nox Swordstresses and Priests, Astels, Pumpkin Heads, Misbegotten, Crucible Knights, Wyrms, Dragons, Commanders, Abductor Virgins, Alabaster and Onyx lords, Black Knives, Runebears, Lorettas, Trolls, Mohgs, Kindreds of Rot, Deathbirds, Ancestor Spirits, Night s Cavalry and probably more. This list includes both the bosses who become minor enemies later on and the bosses who are fought multiple times. Another thing taken from the black sheep of the Dark Souls family are the boss fights which spam you with more than one enemy without much consideration for how such a fight may play out. These include but are not limited to: Commander Niall, Godskin Duo, Crucible Knight Ordovis and Crucible Knight, Valiant Gargoyles. To not bully the mentally and physically disabled middle child of the family let s move on to dumb ideas taken from it s younger, better brother, Dark Souls III. The third installment of the series Elden Ring is a spiritual successor to was often accused for having gimmicky bosses meaning ones which do not play to the series strengths and instead encourage players to preform a set of arbitrary actions in order to complete them. Bosses fitting this description in Elden Ring include: Starscourge Radahn, Rykard, Mohg, Greyoll and Rennala.A lot of the above mentioned problems can be somewhat ameliorated with the help of summons which you are basically forced to use for many of the fights and which the game seems to be balanced around but knowing the Dark Souls' community's feelings towards using the help of summoned NPCs and players on your first playthroughs of any of the past games From should have known it was a bad idea.The moments in which the hitboxes are not quite that wonderful are the various grab attacks. Many of which can outright one-shot you. And we have to remember that the second phase of your second fight of Godfrey is almost entirely based around difficult to avoid grab attack. These types of attacks are almost always frustrating to deal with, not only being extremely punishing but also taking the controls away from the player, and I would actually suggest never using them in games similar to the ones From Software is making.Other problems include the obvious fuckery with the PC version, we are paying a similar price as the console players for a worse product which is not acceptable no matter how beloved a developer is. There are also the atrocious problems with the multiplayer. Not only will you get disconnected from other players both while invading and co-oping but you can actually get punished with a 12-hour long timeout for something that is an error on the part of the developer. They are literally punishing you for their incompetence.I have left story for last because there s honestly not much to talk about. The storytellers at From Software are absolute geniuses but not for the reasons most people think. They have mastered the art of doing very little while letting the players write the story for them. With these games we are all doing the job of the writers and we are not even getting paid for it. Not even partnering with George R. R. Martin could have changed that. The partnership wasn t worth his time nor From s money.In summary, do not buy into the hype. Still, is the game bad? Not really. Is it a good game? Nah. As I said at the beginning, it s schizophrenic. Neither good, nor bad but also good and bad at the same time. If you are really set on playing Elden Ring wait for a sale and a dozen or so patches before buying it.",0
Negative,"At times Elden Ring can feel so close to being a really good game. It's got all the pieces of a good game, but it's been put together the wrong way.You play as one of the only characters with any sort of agency left in a dying world. Your task: to determine the future of this world by killing all of the actors in a story you're just catching the end of. Actors, who's only remaining involvement in their own story is to just sort of sit around and wait for you to kill them.This story is such a blatant rehash of Dark Souls 1/2/3 that it feels foolish now to say I expected more, but I did. Given FromSoft had already shown a willingness to try something new in Sekiro, given George R. R. Martin's much marketed involvement, and given that this game isn't called ""Dark Souls 4""; it was actually really easy to trick yourself into thinking we might get something a little different storywise. In typical Dark Souls fashion however, the story doesn't beg for your attention, so while it's hard to get too invested in it, it's also hard to get too annoyed by it.In what was probably a joke, Steam users are labeling this game: ""Relaxing"". They're actually onto something. Half of the game is genuinely relaxing; the half where you're sitting on a horse.There's an encounter near the start, right after you get your horse, where you're guided down a narrow corridor filled with archers. Probably the most dangerous situation you've come across so far, and then a Giant drops right on top of you. Your instinct is to run past. I've watched a number of people play through this section. They all run, and running works. The game teaches you early on that if you don't feel good about some fights you can just skip em.The amount of mobility you get from your horse makes you feel invincible. Nothing is fast enough to chase you down and ranged attacks are easily dodged. It's possible to get knocked off if you do take damage, but the amount of damage needed is high enough that it never happens outside of consensual combat. You're more likely to be accidentally dismounted when the game misreads a button press than to be forcibly removed from your horse. If you are dismounted, you can instantly resummon the horse with little penalty.The open world is filled with Dark Souls stuff, but when you're on a horse it doesn't feel like Dark Souls. Early on you're told by an enemy to ""Cower in fear. Of the night"". It's unclear what was meant by this, because while there is a day/night cycle, the night doesn't feel any more dangerous. There s a few unique bosses that only appear at night, but because you choose all of your battles these are more opportunities than threats. You can rest until daytime if you want, which I did, but only because it's easier to see during the day, and not because playing at night ruins the relaxing vibes.The amazing power of the horse is too tempting not to use, but you're free to refuse it. The game might actually be more interesting without it. Most FromSoft games have issues like this, where feature X is poorly designed. Feedback from fans tends not to focus around improving X, but to instead declare: ""X is a crutch for bad players. People who use X are playing the game wrong"". The horse is different from X though, because ""Dark Souls with a horse"" is what we all signed up for.When you came across an optional mini-boss in Sekiro, you wanted to kill it because you knew it had something you needed: health upgrades. In Elden Ring, optional bosses drop equipment and spells, but because there's so many ways to build a character, the most likely outcome is you'll get something you can't use. Killing optional enemies also gives you souls which can be used to level up your character, but so will killing non-optional enemies. Getting effectively nothing from optional content is discouraging, and it can only happen so many times before you decide to rely on the Wiki to tell you where to go.Meanwhile, the items every character wants, flask upgrades, are left scattered around the surface of the open world, and are completely unguarded. Exploring the open world can easily become all about running around, snatching up all the items that were left out for you, enjoying the sights, and killing very little. After you're done exploring you'll want to continue with the main quest, but you'll run into a problem. While the game doesn't give you enough reasons to want to do optional content, it still expects you to do some arbitrary amount of it. Your experience forward will vary wildly depending on how much you've done.While exploring I discovered a lone tower guarded by a few enemies. I cleared it out and climbed to the top. At the top there was a portal that teleported me into an empty castle keep. There was a bonfire next to where I appeared, and close to the bonfire was a boss. I put in a few failed attempts on the boss before deciding, ""This isn't something I expected to find right now, I'll put it off until later"". When I finally returned I was so strong that each of my light attacks took away 20% of his health. The boss died so fast that he almost didn't make it to his second phase. This was how I experienced one of Elden Ring's big baddies; one of the few bosses to be built up by the game's opening cinematic.The developers can't know what level you're going to be fighting bosses at. They can only guess, and sometimes their guesses are very wrong. FromSoft's signature ""tough but fair"" boss fights might be here, but I didn't find them. Bosses in Elden Ring can feel too easy or too hard, but never just right. Even if the difficulty was spot on it would still feel wrong, because Elden Ring also uses a number of dirty tricks you'd only expect from an inexperienced developer producing a cheap Dark Souls knockoff.I'll be exaggerating here, but only slightly. Every boss does too much damage and has too much health. Every boss has a frenzied AI, constantly attacking and never leaving themselves open for more than 1 or 2 of your light attacks. Every boss has attacks that will start, wait some arbitrary unit of time, and then deal damage. Every boss has an attack that will kill you from full health. Every boss with two phases doesn't really have two phases; it's just two boss fights in a row with the bonfire in-between taken out. You'll die more in this game than in any other FromSoft game, but you won't feel better when you win, because artificial difficulty just isn't as rewarding as the real thing. In what feels like an admission of guilt, you now respawn right next to most bosses when you die.The two worst boss fights FromSoft has ever made are in this game. Anyone who s beaten the game already knows exactly who I mean. These are the sorts of bosses that, if you only knew they existed, you'd feel pressured to build your character around, because they're not optional. These are the sorts of bosses that would ruin any section of game they're placed in, and one of them is at the very end.Elden Ring features a new summon mechanic where you can choose from a variety of NPC minions to level up and use during boss fights. Going in I decided not to use them. I wanted to play the game the ""right"" way. Halfway through you ll run into the first of the two worst bosses, and that's when my attitude towards summons changed.While summons might've broken previous Souls games, summons fix Elden Ring. Not all the way mind you, but it helps. Summons in Elden Ring are meant to be used liberally and without shame, because that's just what you're meant to do, and because not using them doesn't make you a better or more interesting person. Most importantly, summons are used to unlock the game's only good ending. In what is clearly a feature and not a bug, using summons during the very final boss will sometimes break the AI completely. The boss just sort of sits there, and waits for you to kill it.",0

From Software dropped the ball on this one. As far as gameplay goes it's unlike anything that has come before, which is why it's so irritating that this was released in the state it's in.",0
Negative,"Even though I was able to enjoy Demon's Souls and Dark Souls, I found this game frustrating and decided to refund it. I could torture myself trying to get good, or just enjoy something else, so I think I'll do the latter.",0
Negative,"As of recent patches most of the problems I had about this game are gone, however I still stand by the ""Fun"" factor behind these bosses non existent. Only a few bosses are fun to fight, as most of the late game bosses all play the same and are not fun because they spend way too much time jumping away from you and spamming aoes and combos at the same time, really not fun for melee builds. Maybe a few repeat playthroughs and coop playthroughs will change my mind on this but for now I still can't give it a positive review despite the game being a 85-90%",0
Negative,"I have been anticipating this game since Minecraft Java Edition Release Version 1.14.3, where villagers were required to sleep. Ever since, I have awaited until the release of Minecraft Java Edition 1.18.2, where worldgen tags were added. As you can see, I am an avid open world survival gamer. When I loaded into the world, I knew exactly what to do. I tried collecting sticks and stones to craft powerful tools, but most resources in the game were not interactable. This was the first of many disappointments. I later realized I could not build until I had discovered a level, hammer, nails, and wooden planks, all items far from my reach. I eventually killed an ingrate with my bare hands, and it dropped a pickaxe. I went to a nearby cave and tried to quarry some stone to begin building my kingdom, but that too was for naught. I even leveled my strength to 50, thinking I would need the extra strength to actually break the voxels in the map. I have put over 600 hours in 7 Days to Die, so I can put up with terrible games, but this was way worse than anything I have ever played. It does look very good though.",0
Negative,"I love the combat in sekiro. It was snappy, intuitive, and difficult in a good way. Now how do I describe Elden Ring?. The combat is clunky, animation is slow and laggy. It's difficult sure, but not in a fun and I'll try again kind of way. I really tried to force myself to like it. But the whole dodge, dodge, jumping like a buffoon just isn't doing it for me. Parrying is basically unusable. I really commend those who seems to always get the timing right. There's what feels like input lag from hitting the trigger to animation start is ridiculous. I've had maybe 1/20 success rate of parrying any attacks. It's like From Software took everything that they got right about Sekiro and went ""well let's toss all that out"". I'm happy for Dark Souls fans that enjoy the game. I simply can't enjoy it based on controls alone. If you're a Dark Souls fan, then this is right up your alley. But if you thoroughly loved how Sekiro played, then you will not like this.",0
Negative,"repetitive, boring, all bosses have the same pattern of attacks with small opportunities to hit them for a minuscle percentage of their health or heal, and then you go back to waiting for their delayed attacks so you can dodge again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again with every single boss in this game. oversatured formula that felt like physical pain to continue playing.good looking scenarios though.most of the soundtrack also sounds the same with few exceptions, I miss DS1 and Demon Souls soundtrack.buy this for $1 at most",0
Negative,"Look, Elden Ring(ER) is really fun. It's the best game Fromsoft has released out of all the other Souls-Likes they've made and it's a great culmination of nearly 2 decades of learning how to make a souls-like, but there's just one problem: they don't give much of a crap half the time to fix any issues, and right now, the pc-port is quite crap right now, and a majority of people agree. My game suddenly crashed after visiting the lake of something I forgot, but it's where you can get an s-tier staff, and now it's stuttering like crazy, so I'm kinda peed off. I already had to deal with the invisible enemies and graphic problems, which I was fortunately able to fix thanks to a discussion from the community hub, and it worked wonders, went from managing low to medium graphics to playing maximum settings without a problem. Which begs the question, how does that even happen? I don't recommend getting ER till Fromsoft shows that they care a little more than they do. I applaud them for making a fricking fantastic game, but all of it's issues are dumb and shouldn't have even happened if they cared about how well they're game does. With how great this game is, the reviews should be exceedingly positive cuz we all know it's a damn good game.Overall, can't recommend due to inexcusable performance issues for the pc-port and I'll change this once they can get off their high horses and give the community better peace of mind. This stuff is inexcusable since they've always had some kind of problem with all their souls games(except for Sekiro, that game had no issues at all in my books(but I played it on Xbox).",0

Negative,"Gameplay; 4/5 Fun, challenging, unique.World building; 3/5 They kind of just throw you into stuff but you catch on quickly. Camera; 0/5. The camera angles and adjusting make this game unplayable.Moving makes this game impossible. If you move your character, the camera is going to automatically turn to face whatever you're looking at. This includes during a boss fight or just riding around. You can't look at the scene around you or just analyze what the boss is going to do without having to fight with your mouse to stay focused the whole time. If you side strafe, the camera is automatically going to turn to face the direction you're moving and AWAY from the boss. 70% of this game is spent moving the camera to correct the auto-focus of the game. I have thousands of hours across both Elder Scrolls and Dark Souls. This is by far the worst camera design I've ever played with. It almost makes you nauseous to play. DO NOT BUY until they fix the camera problems or until some modders can introduce a better camera mod.Added Notes: Jump + Swing is the strongest attack in the game by far. It's hilarious seeing players just jumping and swinging at everything.Update: The camera is still hot garbage but you learn to work with it. Otherwise the world building really explodes and has been really fun to dive into. There are some obvious things that need to be fixed (rune exploits and overpowered items). Overall 9 out of 10.",0
Negative,"6/10.My score is not at all affected by the state of the PC port. I'm a huge FROM fan and not at all new to their games. That being said, I think this game is a huge step back for them, especially when compared to DS3, BB, and Sekiro.Pros:-A few bosses are cool.-Legacy dungeons are great.-Beautiful art style.Cons:-Open world is vast and empty. It was genuinely boring to traverse it.-Lackluster soundtrack. You will hear the exact same theme 40+ times against so many bosses.-Limited enemy variety.-Most enemies are annoying to fight. They constantly hit and run you. (I was using Zweihander so opinion might be different for DEX users.)-Enemy spam. Quite frequently, there will be 15-20 enemies on your screen.-Copy and paste dungeons everywhere.-Copy and paste bosses. (Seriously. I've fought a few different bosses like 5 times each. They even start appearing as normal mobs in the levels.)-So many gank bosses.-Annoying one-shot gimmicks.-Low damage, high health. (66 STR at time of review with Zweihander and Grafted Blade Greatsword and it takes 3 L2s to kill late game enemies. Really annoying because they put like 5 of those enemies in a room at once.)-There are a lot of dragon bosses in this game and they all fight the same. Terrible lock-on cameras (They learned how to work the camera against Midir in DS3 so why is it so bad here?) and really boring repetitive movesets. Every dragon is either spent on the horse, drive-bying them, or staring at their feet while hitting them, rolling away based off sound.)-The behaviour of locking on with the camera is a lot worse in this game than their recent titles. Really awkward angles that could be fixed if they zoomed out (something they do in DS3 and Sekiro, but not ER for some reason.)-The main bosses weren't that fun to fight. They have such little windows to punish but attack so often that you have to play overly safe, because they nearly one to two shot you, and can only get one or two hits in every so often.-The design of the main bosses are flawed. They mix in delayed attacks into their fast attacking combos. It definitely makes them harder, but it made me feel forced to sit there and die to them while learning their animations. This was somewhat in their other games, but because the bosses didn't one shot you, it wasn't as frustrating to deal with. (My thoughts on this are probably exacerbated because I was using Colossal Swords.)Late game boss spoiler: Malenia is pure cancer.",0
Negative,Game is good but sufferes from some technical problems right now that shouldnt be happening and just makes the enjoyment of what is an otherwise amazing game hard. Would pick it up for sure once they patch out the stuttering and fps issues.,0
Negative,open world is boring to explore and it reuses the same dungeons and bosses over and over again,0
Negative,Honestly with all these performance issue I cant really recommend Elden Ring. Game runs like ass on any graphic setting on my pc. I experienced several crashes and fps drops in a few hours of playing the games,0
Negative,"It's a really good game, don't get me wrong, but the performance issues are really preventing me from enjoying the game to it's fullest. I've refunded it in the hopes of re-buying once the performance issues have been worked out, or to get it on another platform if From don't fix the PC port.I want to enjoy this game FromSoft, but the performance is truly lacking. Be better.",0
Negative,"Let's just get this out of the way first, do I recommend this game to people at this time? Short answer no. Longer answer, no, because of technical issues making it unplayable, not in a ""lol unplayable trash game cus very minor issue"" but in a real way. The stutter and hitching since the patch. pre-patch it ran flawless on my setup, never dropped under 60fps unless I was in a dense area, silky smooth, now I have constant stuttering, frame drops when doing nothing at all, and hitching. Normally some fps drops wouldn't be such an issue but if you are like me and sensitive to these things, combined with the hitching it quickly becomes a case of becoming physically ill trying to play, not to mention the hitching severely impacting combat. Like when a boss winds up, you get a hitch, your inputs are ignored during this time and you end up with a massive fuck off sword buried in your face. This is directly impacting playability to the point of it not being playable. (This will change if and when From Soft can sort these issues out) Which is a shame because under this, is an honestly fantastic and amazing game. World Design Let's just talk about the world size for a start, its massive. Overwhelmingly so to the point it suffers from the Witcher 3 problem of maybe being too big and ends up a grind just exploring, and the rewards for exploring, let's be honest kind of lackluster. You find a super clever hidden secret, see the chest and get excited, open that badboy up and. oh. a Smithing Stone. Cool, I guess? Sure, there are a smattering of unique weapons and armor laying around, but overall, not rewarding exploration nearly enough as the map deserves because it is honestly extremely well designed, the areas, the interconnectivity, prop placement, all of it just screams the environmental and level designers poured their souls into this. And the in-game map is extremely deceptive at scale. that waypoint you placed on the other side of a seemingly ""small"" lake may take you 10 minutes to ride to, that is of course if you don't get side tracked along the way by something interesting. Or a mother fuggin dragon drops out of the sky and promptly eats you. The only gripe I have is fog. Sure, it can be used for some very nice environmental effects, but it's used overly much in this game, often times covering scenes that are just amazing, and hindering visibility just little too often. Sound design. Again, very good, some scores are a little ho-hum, and samey but when they aren't, they aren't. Nothing like hearing that Souls boss music drop while you're riding along and just knowing deep down you're about to have a bad day. Weapon sounds are nice and impactful, sounding like you're actually spanking something and not just swishing the air. All in all very well done, but not groundbreaking. One thing is for sure though, if you don't end up with a deep seeded hatred for the sound of bells, you haven't spent enough time in the swamplands. Seriously those guys can actually eff right off. Lore, story and NPCs True to From Soft style the story, the lore, are all deliberately left ambiguous unless you are paying attention to what's going on, item descriptions, NPC dialogues and even environmental story telling never give you the full picture, you need to look at all the pieces and put them together yourself. This is all fine, but NPC and their quests fall apart due to the games size. There are a lot of NPCs in this one, and as tradition, obscure and never actually telling you much or pointing you to exactly what it is you need to do. This worked just fine in other games, where the world is much smaller, npcs were fewer and it was easy to keep track of where you saw this person, or area, in this though the world is so huge and it quickly becomes very hard to remember where everyone is, what they wanted or where they will show up. it is very, very easy to miss out on some interesting things unless you use a guide. Combat and difficulty. Oh boi, here is where it's going to be divisive. The game is hard. It just is. ""trash"" mobs are tolerable but can still utterly wreck you if you're not paying attention, for the most part they are balanced with the occasional ones just being God awful. Enemies are fast, aggressive and not bound to the same rules you are, for the most part. They want to kill you and it shows. Bosses on the other hand. Hands down the hardest in any of the Souls games. Period. Unfairly so. Yeah yeah, git gud. Not everyone is an uber leet pro mlg gamer with cat reflexes. I agree with the git gud mantra to a point, that point where it stops being encouragement and just a toxic, blind elitist defense for shitty design and ego. The fact is, bosses are so unfairly hard that From Soft have already started nerfing them. They are far, far too aggressive, too fast, they spam chains far too often, and punish the player way too much. Sure, they should be a challenge, I agree, but there's a difference between challenge and unfairness. Take Margit for example. The first ""story"" boss and probably the first most casual players will face. That guy is a massive wall of despair and most likely where a lot of people will drop the game and never touch it again. Which is a shame that they will miss out of the other less anal-caving-in content the game offers. True From Soft added in some mechanics to help the more casual players, like summons, but even those are getting nerfed due to the vocal minority of angry elitists. ""MUH GAME IS EZ MODE NOW NERF PLZ SO I CAN STROKE MY E-PEEN MORE"" And to this I say, yeah, in the hands of a player with high skill, perfect reflexes and a good build, of course summons on top of that are going to make them seem easy mode, no freaking shit. Yeah, you could just not use them, and leave them for people struggling so they can enjoy the game. But that would take away your ""hardass"" badge if any casual can beat the game, amirite? Mind you, these are the same people that will run around with a full INT+Moonveil build, crying about casuals in their hardcore brutal game. But I digress. Margit is a very good example of the game wanting you to beat it a certain way, that being shield counters, and jump attack spamming. And just not explaining it well at all. Which btw is also a trap, since most people will be here with not much stam invested and that shield block? Welp there goes my stam, broken stance, time to eat shit for the next 5 stunlocked hits and die. Also the item you can buy to stun him twice for free is pretty obscurely hidden. I didn t even know it existed until AFTER I had beaten him. Bosses should reward you for beating them, you should feel proud, but currently for a lot of them, this doesn't happen. When you finally beat a boss that's wiped you 30+ times you don't feel proud, or elated. You feel bitter and angry. This was the case for me when finally beating Ulcerated Tree Spirit. No joy, no sense of pride and accomplishment Just anger. That such a bullshit boss was looked at and someone on the design team said ""yes. this is fair"" Fuck that guy in particular. I beat that damn thing, took my spoils and left. Not even bothering to do a happy dance. In closing. It's a fantastic game, but it is by no means for everyone. Between the absurd spikes in difficulty on bosses, the toxic culture of the ""elites"" the nerfing of things a casual can lean on and the commitment it takes to see it though, hell even the sheer size of it may not appeal to the casual gamer, and will just end up a frustrating, depressing time, which again a massive shame. As someone who genuinely enjoys games and wants as many other people to share the experience, its saddening to know that many people won't get this one. And as a final note, I am not advocating for a games journalist mode, simply options for newcomers or not so dedicated players to be able to join in. Not taking away, but adding.",0
Negative,UI for PC release is for xbox controller. yeah you map out the controls on the keyboard but there are some things that you cant map. like whatever the menu button is. PC release feels like a money grab honestly. It's just not enjoyable to play and is clunky. Maybe i'll circle back to the game once they fix a few things.,0
Negative,"Needs serious balance patches. On top of everything, bloodhound step needs removed from the game entirely and status procs (i.e bleed, frost, madness, etc) should not stagger you.~Patch 1.06 Finally getting better but still not close to balanced.~Patch 1.07 Another good step but still not close to balanced~Patch 1.08 And there goes the winning streak. Bad patch, did absolutely nothing for balance. I love that there is an arena but they should have focused on balancing the pvp first because it's just a cancerous gimmicky . There's basically zero matchmaking, I'm consistently fighting ppl 25 lvls above me and have even see max or near max level players. You can still die from madness without ever being hit. Status procs in general are still bs. Buffing things that don't need buffed and nerfing thing that don't need nerfed, all while that does need buffed and nerfed go ignored.",0
Negative,"As much as I like wandering around the open world and exploring, engaging in fun and expansive combat, discovering exciting places and enemies, I can not recommend Elden Ring on PC at this moment. The technical state of the game is abysmal.- Random FPS drops from 60 to 10- Random stutters- No RT/DLSS/FSR in 2022 on PC- No Widescreen support in 2022 on PC. Irrelevant to me but many are concerned about this.- Mouse/KB support is terrible- The game can stop recognizing gamepad sometimes. Yes, official XBox gamepad. Fully supported by Windows.- Easy Anti-Cheat. I play only offline, I don't like this intrusionware on my PC, might be irrelevant to you. Also blocks mods.I can also critique the game itself for dated and re-used from previous titles assets and animations, past gen visuals, repetitiveness of the open world, etc. Keep in mind that this is a generic open world experience. But still, if technical issues are going to be fixed, it's a solid game with tons of content, quality and fun, even if repetitive.",0
Negative,"Let's be honest, in 2022, as a simultaneous release on PC and consoles, still having "" press X "" and "" press A "" in your HUD and interface is just lazy and shows how much they are not interested in mouse and keyboard players. Spend more time understanding your keybinds than playing! And thats without even talking about the other problems in this game.EDIT : I have since found in the options menu. That said, the multiplayer is quite buggy, only works half the time and is a 10 year old system which gets boring real fast. And thats without talking about ultra wide and the stutters.",0
Negative,"Another FromSoft PC port that's utter garbage. Locked 16:9 aspect ratio, 60FPS cap, limited options (not even a VSync toggle), no real accessibility options, constant stuttering, generally poor performance, ect, ect. I'd keep listing issues, but I refuse to put more effort into this list that FromSoft does into their technical standards.",0
Negative,"One of the best game i have ever played. But don't waste your money for the pc version after 2 years, million copies sold, lots of income. still, the game is a horrible state, unplayable for the most of the pc, even with a 4090. Why? Nice question.",0
Negative,Game is barely playable with assets not loading right so almost every enemy is invisible. Dying to invisible enemies nonstop and not being able to progress much because of it leads me to say don't buy this until it's fixed,0
Negative,"Whilst the game is great, it has several massive flaws that would make me not recommend it in its current state. One flaw i'm sure most people are aware by now is that there's a lot of lag spikes and crashes, and i have experienced those myself, especially late-game. If you happen to crash when the cutscene where the Erdtree burns (stuff later in the game), you will lose all your progress. This happened to me and i would've lost 40 hours of progress if I didn't have back ups available. Furthermore, the amount of gank bosses in this game is staggering and definitely more than I would've expected and frankly liked. Furthermore, the damage you take in this game is unreal at times even for FromSoftware standards, finding myself getting one shot by attacks multiple times across many parts of the game. Now this wouldn't warrant a bad review from me if it was only those issues because they're not major enough, but the potential of losing 40 hours of progress definitely is. Furthermore, i was hard pressed to find as many truly great bosses in this game compared to a game such as Dark Souls III, where most bosses from midgame onwards and DLC are really good, whilst this game's consistency in bosses has been all over the place. Moreover, if you didn't like Sekiro's miniboss reskins then this game will have you complaining even more. This is because there are many bosses (enemies with healthbars) that are recycled throughout the game with minimal change. Whilst to me this isn't the biggest issues since they're really elite enemies, it is definitely something to consider if you're expecting 100% constant variety from this game.",0

Negative,"Breath of the wild 2 was really good! Dark souls 4 was a little meh though. Easiest dark souls by far and this coming from a melee only player. All enemies were way too easy for a Dark Souls game. I get they wanted to appeal to a larger audience and the game isn't bad but I wouldn't go into this expecting it to be the best Souls game. The only thing that they really got down that they did in the other games was badly porting the game to PC.I'm not saying this isn't fun, just keep your expectations in check or you'll be disappointed.If you're looking to scratch that itch and haven't played it already I'd recommend Sekiro Shadows Die Twice or go back and replay DS3.",0
Negative,"Once I beat Gundyr for the first time in DS3 I played the game for 3 straight months and put 350 odd hours into it. Can hardly play video games anymore because of how great DS3 is. I havent been excited for a game release since I was a kid and I was excited for this one. Bought it day one and it was unplayable with stuttering and a constant 40fps in the open world. Lowering resolution to 480p did not change this at all. I didnt refund because I thought they would release a patch to fix it soon. Its been almost a month and its now worse than it was before. 1080ti, i7 7700k, good temps. Every other game runs fine. Do not buy this if you bought a PC to escape 30fps console games. This is unbelievable and I am extremely frustrated.",0
Negative,"At the start the game was great. It's not me or my friends first souls game, but it really felt like it, being completely blind and just going into it. We went and made it to about the Raya Lucaria area before we broke off and started doing our own thing. It was still fun even by myself. I spent a lot of time going around collecting everything I could find and exploring. This was when it went to shit. After the 9000th dragon, 120th slightly stronger random enemy for a boss, and 6 billionth area with too many fucking enemies, I was pretty done.I know people will read this next part and think I'm stupid, but Dark Souls 2 was my favorite in the series. So watching Dark Souls 2 be absolutely berated and shit on by the community, only for those same people to turn around and praise this game for doing the exact same thing didn't help with my opinion of it. This game feels like they just took character movement from DS3 and enemy movement from BloodBorne. So finally here's just some things I've got to complain about. Enemies hit way too fucking hard, bosses are just a waiting game to see if you're going to miss a roll or if your mimic will take agro just long enough for you to get a hit in, FromSoft keeps nerfing anything that's not dogshit (a bunch of spells that I didn't even bother using), ""Open World"" game but it's as linear as any other Dark Souls game, late game areas are all fucking garbage like honestly no fun is allowed there (snowing place, Haligtree, volcano), bosses in big arenas that fly around making you have to wait to do anything. My favorite part of this game is that Radahn is way too big for that horse.I played this game 3 times to get all the achievements and all the quests, this way Miazaki apologists can't use ""git gud"" or ""sounds like a skill issue"". Though if you're saying shit like that then you probably don't have the brain power to understand critisism.Anyway, worth $60? Not in my opinion. Maybe $30. Wait for a sale or something.",0

Negative,"First of I want to say that I've played tons of souls and souls-like games. With that in mind, I'm extremely divided with my experience with this game and here's why.I'll start off with the positives; the first third or half if we're being generous are downright magical, especially the first 20-30 hours or so. For me, time flew by, I stayed up all night exploring, killing tough bosses, finding out all sorts of great secrets and just had myself a blast. Open world and Dark Souls works surprisingly well.or so I thought, but more on that later.The overall atmosphere of the game is also great and it looks gorgeous. Visuals have always been one of the better selling points of Souls-games in my opinion and they nailed that once again. Many areas in the game are as fun to look at as they are to explore and they were for the most part fairly creative with them. Exploring them is also pretty fun, although that again diminishes over time in my opinion; last third being exceptionally boring if you ask me.One double-edged sword for me is the variety given to player to tackle the many enemies that the Lands Between throws at you. While variety is the spice of life and I'm a big spicy food enthusiast, I think this time it might have gone a bit too far. I'm the completionist type who likes to explore everything, which I did during my playthrough of the game; I explored every area, every dungeon, beat every boss, got every possible rune to get whatever ending I desired. The issue is that many of the items you get, you will just not use, which diminishes the eagerness to explore. Spells are good example of this; there are dozens of them in the game, but if you're playing a melee build, which is the most common way to play these games, you will most likely not use them all that much, or mostly a selected handful that boost your combat effectiveness. Still, I enjoyed the exploring overall, but this aspect of it did suffer as a result.Many weapons you get might be hard to upgrade with lacking materials, so once you find what works for you, you're not likely to change, unless to have a backup weapon or two in case you want something specific, like bleed damage for example. Never before has there been an option to get so over-powered so easily, which I feel takes much charm out of the experience. The last third of the game for me was a slog, with any battle be it just normal foe or boss being challenging in a fun way; most of them I could beat after few tries, some of which I didn't even get to hear all of the dialogue. The element of summon spirits is also fuels this much more. Code Vein, also Souls-like game, also had co-op character as integral part of it's design and in that game the difficulty of it was still well maintained. Sadly, I can't say the same for Elden Ring. One spirit summon in particular is notorious and most people who have beaten the game know what I'm talking about. Some people would say that you don't have to use it, which is true, but summon spirits are a game mechanic the game very heavily promotes, be it through upgrades, sheer amount of them you can get and how many of the bosses are seemingly made with one (or more) additional character on your side. Them taking the attention away from you, taking away the one versus one nail biting gameplay the series is known for to me is maybe the single biggest miss with this game. This is the most accessible game From Software has ever done, but I think it has come at too big of a cost. Much like horror movies, to me difficulty of the experience is just part of it's foundation; by default, some people aren't going to like it, and that's okay. With them trying to please everyone, ultimately it feels like the opposite of desired effect was reached, unless the player handicaps themselves.Outside of the issues with the bosses and their design, the second biggest flaw that really hindered my enjoyment of the game is oddly enough the open world nature of the game. Since the player is fairly free to explore the areas in whatever order they desire, it is fairly easy to end up being too low level for a certain area and being too high level for another. Since Souls-games don't exactly show you what level you ought to be for any area (which I think is good, mind you, we don't need these games to be Ubisoft clones), it made some areas extremely boring. In my playthrough, I visited the Raya Lucaria Academy fairly late, after I had beaten Volcano Manor. Volcano Manor was maybe the single best experience to me in the game; the entire area oozed with atmosphere, was challenging, with memorable characters, enemies and bosses. Were everything about the game to this level, I would have given this game two thumbs up for sure. When I entered Raya Lucaria Academy afterwards, it was absolute cakewalk. During my run, I think I died maybe two or three times and that was mostly due to falling, not because of enemies. I'm also by no means the most amazing gamer out there, despite being Souls veteran, but I was simply way too high of a level to the area. I really wish there was some sort of scaling option in the game to keep the areas challenging, but without it the enjoyment for me was ruined almost completely when I never had to learn the boss moves and patterns, as simply going to their face and smacking them did the trick.I also think that the game is too big for it's own good. To me this is maybe heightened the most by the absolutely insane amount of bosses being recycled in the game. There are total of 9 truly unique boss fights in the game, with everything else being copies of at least one another boss one way or another. Some bosses you will see so many times that they lose all of their magic, like dragons or magma wyrms for example; both fights that were initially extremely fun, challenging and memorable, but by 5th time you can't help but to your roll your eyes. I would have much preferred if they had cut out chunks of the game, like the snowy area towards the end to make the rest of the experience tighter, more narrowed, focused and unique.I quickly also want to mention riding and crafting. I was fairly neutral on both of these personally. I didn't use crafting all that much, with exception of ailment items and pots for the most part. There were tons and tons of recipes, but more often than not there was no need for them, at least not for me personally. This is maybe because gathering resources was tedious when you're not riding past a field of them or when exploring a cave. Not a bad concept, but I still felt like it wasn't utilized properly either, but certainly didn't ruin the game for me either.As for riding, I quite enjoyed the horse combat. I liked it when especially when fighting the dragons as you could dodge the breath attacks and quickly catch up with them. Overall though I feel like this system too was a bit underutilized. This might be a personal taste thing, but to me Souls games are still better without it. Again, a hit and miss feature in my eyes.Overall, this is the first Souls game I struggled having to finish. The highs of the game are very much up there, the first third or half of the game is truly a magical experience, definitely worth both the time and money I put into it. As the game progresses, however, the magic fades away and you're left with big, yet empty feeling world. The numerous issues that seem to go up against the very core design the series is both know and loved for makes this a bitter soup to swallow. I can't say that I hated my time with the game, but I can't say that I wholeheartedly enjoyed it either. I hope that despite the insane success of this title that From Software takes few steps back to inspect their work before starting the next project. If their next game repeats most of the things that were in the Elden Ring, it might be my very first purposeful pass for the series. And as someone who really loves these games, I hope that won't be the case.",0

Negative,"I've been as excited for elden ring as anyone else, and while the game is fun and engaging, there are a few issues that make me want to finish and then immediately go back to ds3. The most glaring of these issues is the enemy movesets (specifically leonine misbegotten and draconic tree sentinel). Every enemy in elden ring is fair in at least some regard, but their movesets can be over the top and tedious to deal with. adding instant followups and undodgeable moves for artificial difficulty doesn't make a boss/mid level enemy fun so much as annoying. PVP is dead and you have to want to get ganked to play, so as much as I'm enjoying and going to enjoy this game the detractions are just too much for replayability to be anything beyond ng+1 to 3.

Negative,"Elden ring is a good game. It is not a great game. Does it suffer from the exact same problems every open world game does? Absolutely. From repetitive side content, to janky 'free movement', and suspicious liminal spaces: its all there. There are at least two large spots, well marked and accessible, that might as well be soul traps. You can get in, but you cannot get out and any runes you may have had will be there forever. Similarly, I've only found one location that felt 'lived in' within the context of the world with some life that wasn't just an enemy to fight or avoid, placed there to break up an otherwise empty map. The horse's (or goat?) double jump is your main tool of dealing with difficult terrain, however, it is possibly the least effective application of that old gaming staple. To top it off, From's meticulous and artful models often have such complex geometry that you will find jumping suddenly impossible if there is the slightest of overhanging texture above you. And that does not even touch the horrors of mounted combat which is encouraged, if not forced in many areas.The bosses and special encounters that give the studio it's reputation include some of the worst design choices I have ever seen (not to spoil too much, but there is an enemy that has infinite mana, range, and can teleport while casting spells. You know, fun). Every game in the Dark souls engine has the same camera problems and yet there are still impossibly large enemies that take up every pixel on your screen with just their crotch, making reading their moveset difficult at best. Gone are the fun gimmicks, its all hitsponge 6-strike combos here. Jump attack is true new addition to the dark souls family and it is a welcome one, but its too strong. There is very little reason to attack any other way other than to build up bleed or cast your spells. It can serve as both attack and defense and its genuinely fun, as is most of the core combat (when you aren't facing a poorly tested enemy).The things you want in an open world rpg, cool loot, leveling up, an immersive world filled with a variety of scenes and characters, etc. are all there in theory, but in every case, things fall short and almost feel unfinished, like there was supposed to be more there, but the game just got too big. Elden ring is one of the better open world rpgs out there, but it falls disappointingly short. The strength of the game comes from the variety of tools provided to the player. The weakness is in how so many of those tools feel worthless or unnecessary next to others clearly more valued by the developers. Freedom to express yourself within a given ruleset is what makes games fun. Elden Ring gives you freedom, then punishes you for exploring it. Not by being difficult, but because a lot of the secrets you'll find weren't given the same attention as others. No, I don't want another chest full of mushrooms. Thank you.",0
Negative,"too hard, game sucks",0
Negative,"I wanted to love this game and there was a boss (the secret rot one) which almost redeemed the game for me just because of how well designed it was. But unfortunately it's just nowhere near what I'd expect from a team who has been perfecting (or trying to perfect) the same formula for 13 years.If you just want more dark souls you'll get it but at the cost of the many problems the series has picked up along the way.HP remains a huge problem and trivialises the later parts of the game when you can take multiple highly damaging hits and live. To counter this the devs have added aoe bursts on the end of standard attacks attacks, long ranged pokes, and punishes to every bosses' moveset. But rather than solve the problem its just made it more apparent. I felt safer getting hit by a bosses' 'big attack' than I did taking a combo from them, solely because every boss HAS to pressure you constantly to prevent tankier players from simply stalling for a chance to heal and usually the only respite from this is the window after they throw out their giga blast or whatever it might be.The series has always had this problem but the handling of souls/runes and levelling in general are to blame for the HP problems being even more apparent here. Back when the games were confined to a series of linear dungeons rather than an open world your options to progress were either run at a boss until you beat it or farm souls, the latter option being largely organically disincentivized due to the act of grinding the same mob over and over being awful compared to the former option of just playing until you understand the boss enough to beat it. Now you can simply leave off fighting a boss, explore the open world until you feel powerful enough, then return with a proportionately higher level than is probably intended for the area and steamroll it. Earlier souls games had multiple paths you could follow sure but they all eventually bottlenecked in either progression or mindless farming. Here the farming is far more enjoyable as its baked into exploration, but it means that balancing the game is virtually impossible and it shows in the most important part of any souls game.The bosses.I like a boss with punishes. I like a boss with surprise aoe attacks that catch you unawares. But when EVERY boss has these attacks it ceases to be an interesting challenge and becomes a bland and uninteresting slog fest. Not to mention that the addition of spirit ashes has meant that many bosses have had to be designed around multiple characters fighting it which is a HUGE problem for players who don't engage in online multiplayer and don't want to summon ashes.I'll not name specific boss names to prevent spoilers but let's just say that the last half dozen bosses in the game suffered from all the above problems and it completely took the wind out of the games' sails for me.I could go on about how magic breaks the game, how strength and the weapons associated with it pale in comparison to dex, or even how having higher poise turns out to be a detriment in many cases when the opening attack of a combo by a boss doesn't knock you down and leaves you open to another attack immediately after, but I won't go further than that.Overall I feel kind of sorry for Elden Ring and the players who have just arrived on the souls game scene. What you've received is a game tainted by the DNA of its predecessors, and if we receive another addition to the series I'd like to see it be much less shaped by the well meaning yet harmful influence of its parents.I'd still rate the game a solid 6/10 and for players who aren't as invested in the series as someone like me it's a fine romp with some frustratingly badly designed parts (me taking 1/6th of my hp from a hit but my horse being one hit. In fact; just the horse combat in general really).But I still have to give it a No recommendation because it really does bring all the worst parts of the previous games with it and even manages to create a few new problems of its own.",0
Negative,"I don't think that the open world adds anything other than extra length to the game that is padded out with halfass filler content. There's a bunch of lame skyrim dungeons all over with uninteresting bosses, and most bosses are reused extensively. There's almost 200 boss encounters in the game and by far the majority of them are repeat fights and multi-enemy fights. Some bosses are reused 4 or 5 times. A lot of the bosses are very bad, and they seem tuned to output fuck-you damage as like a ""ehe you will lose all your souls"" meme because everyone's used to this combat but it's got a reputation for difficulty to maintain. It just seems very low-effort.The meat of the game is the ""legacy"" dungeons, which are basically your typical ""Dark Souls"" zone. Some are fantastic, some aren't. There aren't very many.FromSoft is back on this race to the bottom of weapon variety where they nerf everything (PvE included) that the PvP community decides is OP until there's only a handful of things worth using. If you played DS2 or DS3 at launch you will be familiar with where that's headed.I really got tired of hearing the same ""generic boss encounter"" music. I miss when bosses had their own music. A few do, the majority don't.The story here is the least interesting of any game in this series unless you include Sekiro. Several NPCs go on extended loredumps or thoroughly explain their motivations, feelings, and plans at length and for no reason. You can cast a spell at a statue to be told the big twist in the lore.The system where you can switch weapon arts is cool. A dedicated ""jump"" button adds a lot to the combat. It's nice that they made something other than R1s viable. It's a shame that all of these improvements to the combat are in service of fighting a reskinned Asylum Demon 9 times.",0
Negative,"Things that irk me the most:- nonconsensual PVP when you're in a coop mission.- absolutely horrendous multiplayer mechanics.- inconsistent framerates, especially irritating when you have to nail tricky jump.I wish there was a 'meh' rating but the pvp invasion heavily weights against an upvote.",0
Negative,"Fine game itself, yet it suffers from many problems.World - 10/10. It is beautiful, vast, and dangerous.Weapons - 7/10. Great variety of weapons and WA, powerstancing. Retarded scaling and upgrade. Zwei and K***ht's GS, both +25 Flame Art on stats 40 in str/dex/fai have around 50 AR difference. Shields upon upgrading getting better scaling (and damage), yet almost no bonus stability and none of defence. Final upgrade (+24->+25 / +9->+10) might lower guard stability.Armor - 8/10. Most variety in clothing and light armor sets. 3 sets (foot soldier/soldier/realm knight) was shamelessly used 5 or more (Limgrave/Caelid/Liurnia/Leyndell/Haligtree/Mausoleum) times with minimal changes.Crafting - 9/10. Few materials can be bought, most are not despite their usefulness. I.e. bones for arrows available for purchase and any kind of rowa fruits are not. Like hunting is more annoying than running circles in order to collect plants or stones.Bosses - 8/10. In dungeons and over the world same bosses reused many times. Unique ones, as it should be, are majestic and challenging.Technical side - 6/10. Despite almost month after release it still have problems, some of them pretty severe. Missing 10th ritual pot; issues with walking mausoleums in Mountaintop of Giants; Edgar, who decided not to invade player and so blocked questline; alt+tab crashes; infinite loading in PvP upon transfering from host to home and vice versa; good old freezes.PvP - 0/10. Good (meta tier) PvP build consists of 1) thrusting weapon (spear, thrusting sword), 2) homing missiles (Star Shower, Swarm of Flies), 3) status effects (bleed, madness). What bad in this? Well, thrusting weapons grants fast and distant hits, homing missiles don't let enemy to use anything but rolls or quickstepping cause of multiple hits danger, otherwise it leaves him open to attack with no chance to dodge or counterattack due to aforementioned multihits which will interrupt attempts to do anyting, and status effects on proc grants bonus damage equal about 2 hits. But thats not all! Now status effects have great animations, and they will hold enemy in place for ~0.5 sec in case of bleed and ~2 sec for madness. Even if enemy dodges final hit that will fill effect bar, he'll be forced in animation and open to another attack. And so PvP filled with metaslaves equipped with vyke's spears, blood miracles, katanas and (b)estocs of all forms and sizes.Last, but not the least, is current state of DS servers. Goddamn M O N T H passed since promiced fix, and servers still dead as doornail.TL;DR - good game, wait for fixes and don't go in PvP if you value your nerves.",0
Negative,"This is a horrible PC Port. I understand Souls Like games are supposed to be hard, but I expected to be battling monsters and dragons, not a poorly ported game. First of all the frame rates drop during boss fights. You know, the worst time imaginable for your game to do that. It says something that the best version of this dumpster fire is playing the PS4 version on a PS5. Then there's the controls. I should have requested a refund the second I saw the default controls were an xbox controller, on a PC port. Even the normal default keys are nonsensical. It's like FromSoft is trolling at every level. Shift is Jump, Spacebar is Sprint, G opens the map. And the worst of all. the Arrow Keys, are what you have to use to use items, including but not limited to health potions, throwing daggers, summons and getting on your freaking horse. Good luck taking that health potion in the middle of a frame dropping boss fight. ""Why don't you just re-bind the keys""? Well the thing is, you can only partially do that. For some of the keys. Want to activate a special skill on your sword, and your shield? Sorry, can't do that on the PC because of the awful control setup. Speaking of trolling, you can't even ""exit"" the game. When you are ready to quit the game, you have to wait for it to relog into the servers, just like when you launch it, and THEN it gives you the option to finally exit to your desktop. Thanks for that 30 seconds of my life I'll never get back, every time I launch the game. The leveling in the game is terrible too. Some people call the game ""Brutal"" because of how hard it is. It isn't really, because you don't really lose anything, except time waiting on loading screens and any runes you might have. What is brutal, is the fact that to get powerful, and level up your character requires you to do boring ass ""rune farms"" to increase your stats so you can use better weapons and skills etc. You don't progress and get more powerful by achieving things in the game, you do it by rune farming, which is incredibly lame. For Example, after I beat Roderick, after like 40 tries, I was excited to get 20,000 XP. OOOH, just short of the 21000 I need to level from 60 to 61. Guess I'll go rune farm another 1000 so I can level up a stat before I progress in the actual game. Congrats FromSoftware, your level 9000 trolling worked. I've Uninstalled, and wont be spending money on any of your products again.",0
Negative,"This game is bootiful, the gameplay is fun if you don't crash, the boss fights feel pretty cool when you don't crash, the world is open and amazing to explore if you don't crash, playing with friends is cool if they or you don't crash (crashing online could result in a ban because the online anticheat sucks). i am writing this review now with my 74 .7hrs now even though i wanted to do it after i finished the game,but alas my game will not launch anymore ,reinstalled drivers ,windows update ,verify files, reinstalled the game. In the this state my game is literally unplayable and i am unable to finish. developers need to GIT GUD!",0
Negative,"Never seen a worse optimized game in FOREVER. Even 2077 ran fine on my 3080 at launch, if the effects were dialed down. Now with my 3080Ti, the frame rate could dip to single digits, and FS even capped the frame rate to 60! Just f**king unbelievable in 2022. Fortunately, the frame rate cap only took modders about 10 hours to remove. F**k U FS!40 Hours into this game, after installing a patch that unlocks frame rate, i could say that the game content is solid. But I'm not gonna change this review to positive, because performance is essential. Frame rate still drops really low even with the patch, I consider such performance unacceptable. I heard that the game has sold over 10M copy, so this negative review is the only way to tell FS that performance is important. If I change my review, I fear that the next game from FS is gonna be impossible to run even with NASA computer.",0
Negative,"Quantity =/= Quality the game.First of all, this is the worst PC port I've seen in years. To this very day many people are still having issues with crashes, low framerates, invisible enemies, stutters etc. It's especially weird because all previous titles aside from DS1 had 0 issues and were well ported. Not to mention that they decided to add Easy Anti Cheat which is notorious for not only being completely useless vs cheaters but also affecting game performance.The open world of this game adds literally nothing to the experience, only takes away from it. It honestly feels like the horse is an afterthought they put later on. Constant reused assets from caves and same looking copypasted dungeons to soldier camps to same castles to enemies and bosses you get to fight throughout the entire game. Cruicible knights and erdtree spirits and avatars for example. Once you've reached halfpoint of the game you've seen all the enemies the game has to offer.This is the first souls game where I actively had to seek content. You arrive at a random cave or dungeon clear it under 10 minutes and then search for another point of interest, rinse and repeat. I have never been so bored playing a fromsoft game, when so many reviewers called this game a ""masterpiece"" I believed them for a second, but after playing the game myself, it's anything but. There were times when I was so bored of the game I just turned it off to do something else. At later point of the game I was so burnt out I just wanted to finish the game and never touch it again.That being said, legacy dungeons are the best part of the game along with the best bosses this game can offer. At the end of the day there's some redeeming qualities to this game but there are very few inbetween. I can't say that I recommend this game, not for its awful pc performance or the gameplay itself. Buy it at a huge sale if you haven't already. I hope future soul titles will go back to being content packed experiences rather than being in a barren, empty and boring open world.",0

The frame rate is capped to 60 fps and 21:9 resolutions are not supported and modding to play at 21:9 makes it so you cant play online. These are all easy fixes that will never be patched into the game, do not support companies that continually discount the PC community in favor of consoles.",0

Negative,"Having enjoyed Dark Souls 1, loved Dark Souls 2, and absolutely adored Sekiro, I decided it was worth buying Elden Ring as soon as possible after release just to see what that first-month experience would be like. I've come to regret that decision immensely. Elden Ring, as it turns out, is more or less just Dark Souls, but a lot bigger and a lot emptier. Somehow, being open-world has managed to turn a lot of the game's predecessors' strengths into weaknesses; in particular, exploration feels frustratingly tedious and often unrewarding, with enormous swathes of land being empty ground and most items being soul consumables or crafting materials that already respawn in the overworld. Despite GRRM's backstory, the game also feels like some of the worst storytelling that FROM's ever done, with bafflingly underwritten sidequests, lore curveballs that are never elaborated on and never given context, and a frustrating inability to explain foundational core concepts like what the Elden Ring actually is or why being Elden Lord is important. I've never felt so burned out or disconnected or apathetic after finishing a FROMsoft game before- not even Dark Souls 3, which was actually fairly miserable for the first 75% of the game or so- and for the first time ever, I have zero urge to start another playthrough, either on NG+ or on a new character. My main thought when playing most of the game was ""I'd rather be playing Sekiro"", and quite frankly it's far past time for me to act on it.",0
Negative,"Great game but the Pvp invasions and the abuse of people downloading mules to bully new players is beyond abysmal. Getting one shot by builds people literally have files to install on. Can only read ""its intended to fight anything"" by the abusers so much. I get it, you sometimes get into 2v1 ect, but a vast majority of people just throw end game gear at a wretch and point down as you bleed out. It is a fun game but the constant invasions just slapping you down that far out scale you is beyond disgusting. The blatant mod downloading that bypasses EAC that hurts online isn't caught but apparently cosmetics are. (Note I have not downloaded any mods that last part is heresay to be fair.) Easy anti cheat slows down the game but somehow doesn't catch any of these. From you have made 5 games like this I know you can do better please! Otherwise the game is great, some bad porting or optimization here or there but great overall. I want to change this to positive but until I see a notable change or system to deal with this problem I honestly refuse to change it.",0
Negative,"Not sure why Steam doesn't recognize paragraphs, so I put the horizontal line between them.Well, after finally finishing this game and investing over 120h I have to unfortunately say that it was not worth it. But wait! You just say you played it for over 100h, it cannot be that bad, who plays a game for 100+ hours they don't enjoy? The answer is simple - probably most of the people that played this game. The game starts very strong, with alien fantasy world to explore with exceptionally strong art direction (which is anyway a staple of the Souls games), very good combat, now with some additional tricks like Ashes of War to make it more interesting, and excellent itemization (thank god, loot is fixed and you are properly rewarded for exploring or beating bosses, randomized loot in most games need to go die in a corner). All this is enough to draw you into the game and keep playing, even when the freshness of the setting and the combat starting becoming more stale.Once you reach the midpoint, you are already pretty weary of everything and general flaws that all souls game suffer from become very prominent. Yes, the art direction remains strong throughout and along with finding some cool new item or spell is the only thing that draws you to keep exploring. The thing is that the midpoint of Elden Ring more or less corresponds to the lategame of usual Souls game and just as you are getting tired of everything, the game finishes. Here, on the other hand, the game keeps going and the focus on combat starts to get very tiring. Most of the open world games mix-up their gameplay - prominent examples are RPGs like Witcher 3 or Fallout: New Vegas, where combat (which, admittedly isn't particulary good) is intermixed with dialouge and some light puzzle solving or maybe some mini-games (""Wanna play Gwent?""). This holds true also for non-open world games like Persona or Final Fantasy (I am referring to older ones). There is a good reason for this - repetition leads to borderom sooner or later, no matter how good the stuff is. But Souls games never had particulary interesting ""quests"", if you can call them like that. The characters that inhabit the world are more like fun concept that Miyazaki came up with while making the game and then just put them in. There is nothing really interesting about these characters and theses ""quests"" are simply linear progression where you talk with them at various locations and the locations where they appear are rather non-sequitor, so you would probably just look it up online. Furthermore, like most open-world games which are too big for the content they can reasonably provide, the game sufferes from repttion - enemies, bosses and entire dungeons are re-used. From 30-40 dungeones, most of them have the same layout and enemies with same bosses mixed here and there. While this is forgivable in first hours, it starts getting quite aggravating at this point. Lastly, the generally vague premise of all Souls games also starts working to Elden Ring's detirment. While the main ""plot"" is usually unsual and quite interesting, most of it is kinda left in the air, up to the player to interpret it as they will. This worked somewhat fine in most Souls games up to this point due to a shorter runtime and bigger focus on boss battles, so that you kinda try to piece it all together from item descriptions, environmental storytelling and boss design. But even if you did not bother too much with it, it was alright since by the time you start really questioning what are you doing, it is already the end. But here, you are already past that point and you are wondering why the heck are you doing all this? To see the story through to the end? There is not much story to speak of and, as such, you are kind of left with just navigating interesting dungeons. However, you can still truck through all this and ignore some of the flaws since, if you did most of the previous areas, you are probably over-leveled and the content is not too hard. And by this time you probably invested almost 60-80h, so you want to see it finished.The endgame is where everything breaks aparat. Not only are you sick and tired of everything at that point, but as a coup de grace, the game has a large jump in difficulty that is mostly artificial, with enemies hitting very hard, having bloated healthbar and having anoying placements where you cannot manuveour easily. Generally speaking, there is quite a number of annoying enemies in these game from the very start - they are quite fast, have attacks that easily cover large area and can go on for a while. This is mildly annoying in the beginning and becomes more prominent in midgame, but you can still deal with it since mose of the hits are not that damaging if you invested some points in vigor, so you can tank some of the hits and still emerge victorious. At the endgame, however, they turn this up to eleven. Large number of enemies have strong poise, meaning you cannot stagger them easily, large healthbar and have combos that just keep on going. Bosses are not much better. This artificial jump in difficulty inflates already lengthy runtime that has overstayed its welcome 20 hours ago. This just leads to further frustration as you are constantly blocked at every opportunity from just finishing the game, leading to a positive feedback loop of dying and getting more frustrated. At this point, I was so sick and tired of the game, that I just wanted to drop it all together. But guess what? You already invested 100h in all of this, and it would be a shame to let it all go to waste, so you press on, no matter how much you hate it. As a side note, there is rather infamous optional endgame area that exemplifies all that I mentioned to the highest possible degree. By the time I reached the end boss, I was completely burned out and just wanted to get this crap over with. But as a final nail in the coffin, the last boss is essentially two bosses back to back, where second boss is exceptionally annoying and artificially difficult, with a lot of deadly attacks and the fact that you just can't seem to catch up to him to deal some damage. I literally have no idea how anyone gets through this endgame area unless they are running some sort of meta-like build, i.e. not exactly meta build, but still similar enough to allow you to power through all this. Coincidentally, this was apparently the case for me by pure accident - I just though it was cool to make a bleed build. If anyone is running sub-optimal build, they probably would be stuck on this area so long they would just give up or play for another 50+ hours until they learned everything by heart. Lastly, it should be noted that all of this factors combined make it so that you feel like you did not make much progress from the very beggining - you die equally easy or even easier than you did at the very beginning and the damage you do is higher, yes, but the amount of effort it takes to take down an enemy is about the same as in the beginning or even higher. In essence, the player is robbed of the reward to see his build reach its power peak, adding salt to the wound.In conclusion, I simply cannot recommend this game in good spirit. Yes, beginning is great, midgame kinda of annoying, although still managable, but in the end, for all your efforts you just get one big proverbial middle finger from the developers. At the very end, I had a feeling I was wasting my time playing this game, but I kept playing due to significant time investment and I do not wish anybody to get caught into that trap, which is why I am giving it a thumbs down. Lastly, I would like to mention that 1 year later this game still suffers from a number of technical issues, like lag spikes I experienced throughout entire game and that seem like it will never be addressed. This also can sour the experience quite a bit and at some points be even the reason why you die increasing the frustration.",0
Negative,The hardest thing to beat in this game is the black screen that you get when you launch the game.,0
Negative,"Great game ruined by performance issues, that have yet to be addressed almost a month after release. In fact, the latest patch as of writing this review (1.03) did introduce general performance issues for me on top of the stuttering, with generally lower framerates across the board with low CPU/GPU-usage and with lower graphic's settings barely affecting framerates positively. For comparison's sake, I've played this game on a 8700k/RTX2070 and R5 2600/GTX1060-6GB rig, both with 16GB/3200MHz memory and the game running on a regular 500mb/s read/write SSD.Missing integral PC-features again, like no 60FPS cap or Ultra-Wide support does not help this port either. As is tradition with FromSoftware's PC-ports, 3rd-parties can easely provide these features. Too bad that Easy-Anti-Cheat now prevents those from letting the player go online with these tweaks applied, while many of the same cheats from previous soulsgames already made their return to Elden Ring. Also VALVe seemed to have fixed most of the stuttering issues, by making optimizations to Proton, their translation layer to run Windows-native games on Linux. So i hope you don't mind switching to an entirely different OS for one game.I wouldn't be half as annoyed by this, if the game wouldn't be as fun as it is or if we wouldn't do this song&dance with FromSoftware's PC ports for actually an entire decade now.",0
Negative,"The game has a good combat system, fun enemies to fight, great visuals.But.The lag is something that ruins the whole experience, the fun bosses become annoying not because of their design or their combo's but because your inputs don't work a third of the time. I can get the timing down easy, I can manage their combos but when the dodge button doesn't work there is nothing i can do but take the hit. I've had many runs ruined because my inputs either didn't go through or went through far too late throwing me into another attack I can easily dodge.All this because of unpredictable input lag and frame drops, at times it feels less like I'm fighting the boss but I'm fighting the game. I can't remember having this issue with any other souls title even DS1, the game is not ready for release and I would not recommend buying it for anything above 20.",0
Negative,"Elden Ring is disgustingly overrated. It's innovative in some places, and regressive in many others. A game is more than the sum of its parts, but FromSoftware has stuck to a decade-long formula without making any substantial improvements. Other developers have achieved considerably more with their properties in much less time. I'd say you should just play the original Dark Souls, but Bandai Namco delisted it for the lazily outsourced remaster. Buy Elden Ring if you want more of the same in an open world structure. As a long time fan, I'm looking forward to whatever the talented team goes on to develop. Hopefully, it'll be something exciting and different.",0
Negative,FPS lock and a strange UW screen behaviour. I could play after first installation for about 1h in ultra wide no problem. After restarting the game I suddenly have black bars on the side.

Negative,it is unacceptable that in 2022 AAA project like Elden ring being such a technical mess. like cmon why in the world Formsoftware cant polish their old engine. the stuttering and framedrops on RTX 3090 and graphics on 2015 level. on top of that using of DX12 that is known for stuttery mess when dont executed wrightly. So while being a grate game as it is I cant recommend it cause the technical issues are just overwhelming. I will change my score when and if it will ever be fixed. For now its its 4 out 10,0

I appreciate that FromSoftware is a company that's commited to gameplay first, but this is still a shame and I don't understand why they would tarnish (ha!) their work like this.Not recommended in this state. If they fix the stutters and enable ultrawide suport, this might change.P.S.: Launching the game with keyboartd+mouse only: you have to confirm choices with E und use Q to go back/exit. Enter or escape won't work. YOu ahve to figure that out by yourself though, button prompts on screen are for controllers only. SERIOUSLY!?!?!?! Absolutely ridiculous",0
Negative,"There's a LOT to love, but maybe wait until the asset-streaming issues are fixed. Sometimes your horse won't load, so you're stuck running away from a dragon on foot while whistling for nothing at all. Sometimes you die because a big nasty thing took a long time to load in an area that looked safe, and spawns on top of you. Sometimes the dominant strategy to get back to a boss is ""sprint through the area before all the monsters load"". Rarely, the floor doesn't load, and you fall into the void. I wonder how many important NPCs I've missed because they didn't spawn while I was riding past them.I know it's happened at least once. The rest of the game runs great! It just sucks at loading things.even just the map sometimes takes a literal 30 seconds to display, and my computer beats all the listed specs.",0
Negative,"First of all, the game itself is amazing. Lore, world building, environments, and combat are all as good as they ever have been in the hands of FromSoft.Unfortunately, the game runs like buttered ass.-48 hours into this game, the game has crashed 9 times. That might seem like a decent ratio, but why is it crashing in the first place? The game itself could have been optimized better by my 82 year old grandmother, who cried when my dad showed her how to log into her email for the first time.-Any time things start to move a little fast, the game has a tendency to stutter so badly that you can no longer dodge attacks on time. You end up running the same areas a few times because you'll get issues at the most inopportune moments, and get got.-There are a hefty amount of people that cannot play with a controller, and I am one of them. I've looked at about 8 different threads and website posts about potential fixes, and none have helped me. The controller is recognized, I can even pull up the Xbox menu by pressing the Xbox button on the controller, but Elden Ring will not detect a single input from the device.That being said, I have suffered through all 48 hours of bad controls on mouse and keyboard and it's definitely playable, but you're gonna have a bad time doing it.-When you close out of the game, be it from Alt+F4ing or quitting through the menu, for some reason the game doesn't close, it only suspends. You end up having to hunt it down on your Task Manager because it's still going to use multiple gigs of RAM until you do.I really want to love this game but with the addition of EAC, we can't even expect a community fix like there was with Dark Souls 1. As of right now it's a bad port, and unfortunately the parts that are bad are bad enough that the good things don't shine through. Some people still can't even launch the game, and we've had one 9MB patch to fix some EAC issues, make the mouse a little better to use, and to cut down on the files needed to load into a new area. Certainly appreciated, but I am hoping for a bit of urgency to get this game right and I kind of doubt it will come.",0

Negative,"Wonderful world building, fun exploration, incredible level design (sometimes), top-notch artistry. I'd love to immerse myself more in this world, it's a cool place to be. As per usual, FromSoft delivers in spades when it comes to their creative vision.Unfortunately, I really cannot say the same for the gameplay. This may be a hot take but I don't enjoy the roll-centric gameplay of Souls-likes. I struggled with it when I played Dark Souls for the first time and grew more tired of it with every sequel. By Dark Souls 3 I was definitely weary of it. I began to figure that FromSoft's style of game design just isn't my cup of tea - but that's when they released Sekiro, the perhaps most fun game I've ever had the joy to play. It brought so many improvements, large and small, to the old formula that I am genuinely at a loss for words why Elden Ring discarded all of them except for the jump (thank god they kept that at least).Gone is the spectacle of boss fights where weapons clash and fancy combos weave seamlessly into the exchange of blows, replaced by the tedious roll-and-poke of the olden days.Gone is the gripping immediacy and clarity of the story afforded by a voiced protagonist, replaced by a mute plot machine whose actions are incomprehensible without conducting serious research - and even then they lack any kind of emotional impact because who really gives a damn about the protagonist? Make no mistake, I'm not riffing on the lore; I think the world of ER is vastly more interesting than the world of Sekiro. But did I ever feel like my character was anything more than the embodiment of my gameplay inputs? Nope. Sekiro, on the other hand, had personal stakes in what he was doing. He had things to say to bosses. There were reasons he fought things. I miss that.Gone is the freedom to experiment with all the tools at your disposal because now you need to respec (not the biggest deal) and expend a serious amount of resources upgrading your weapons to make them viable to try in the first place - and heaven forbid you end up disliking whatever you're trying out.And that's just discussing the biggest things I miss from Sekiro and not going into the individual failures of Elden Ring, such as an abundance of lazy bosses with an attitude of ""just put two to make it harder"", the fact that their hand-crafted crypts somehow feel even more lifeless than the chalice dungeons in Bloodborne and that we are still stuck with an archaically clunky ""co-op"" system that forbids the use of the horse, doesn't let you enter certain areas, separates you after a boss and opens you up to invaders.Anyway, given the reception of Elden Ring and its spiritual prequels, I have no doubt that I am in the minority and that most people either genuinely enjoy the design as-is, or are simply too obsessed with the company to recognize any flaws in their games. Maybe it's coming from people new to the series. I don't know.Either way, I'm not going to tell you that Elden Ring is a bad game. I'm just telling you that, as someone who had all the incentive to get into the game (as someone who's played every game in the series, from Demon's Souls to Elden Ring), it felt like a massive disappointment in so many ways and left me so annoyed with its idiosyncrasies that, for the first time, I ended up not finishing it (I gave up on Malenia and Godfrey). I'm determined, now, not to purchase the next Souls-like game anymore. Not unless I can see that the design is shifting more into a direction I can gel with.If you are somebody who genuinely enjoys the way that the Dark Souls series, Bloodborne, etc. play then, by all means, get Elden Ring. You are probably going to love it. Otherwise, I'd caution against giving in to the hype. You'll get more out of the narrative from YouTube than you will in the game proper, and if you want to enjoy good gameplay, do yourself a favor and buy Sekiro instead.",0
Negative,"2023 INFO:- Vignette and SSAO still ugly.- Load screen crash still not fixed (since launch). Happens when dying repeatedly to a boss.- Combat rebalanced many times. Separated into PvE/PvP.- Some bosses nerfed/buffed, then reverted.- They added markers for obscure main story goals.- Raytracing = low FPS, fixed by upgrading CPU.- Sometimes freezes/crashes. Dunno why.CONCLUSION / TL;DR:It's okay. Not as new/different as I'd hoped. Has a bunch of things I don't like. They obviously just plugged DS3 into an open world and didn't clean up the design issues properly. It's somewhat forgivable because it's still a decent game, but it could've been so much better. Bloodborne, DS1 and DS3 are better games, to me.Early to mid game is fun, but world is too big and pacing is bad. Some parts are a slog. It's not like Skyrim where you can go anywhere, b/c upgrades require specific locations. Progression route is also often obscure. I've seen streamers play for months and say ""I must be near the end"" but they're not even 20%. I bet many burn out before the end. Summon spirits make bosses a total joke. I'd prefer if they didn't exist.Maybe it's me, but the player character feels less invested/attached to the world/characters than other Souls. That's prob why people often forget what they're doing/where they're going.The open world in this game is redundant. Too much empty space between points of interest. I often close/rest my eyes when moving around in Elden Ring. I think it reflects my level of attentiveness. I can play 1 hour of Withering Rooms and it feels like 3 hours. When I play 3 hours of this, it feels like 1 hour because so much of it is just moving from point A to B.I usually replay Souls games as 10+ characters with different builds. As of 2023, I've only beaten this twice. I stopped 3-4 chars right before end-game b/c there are too many reasons to not progress (eg. irreversible endgame changes). Anyway, that's my personal experience. If you're interested, try it. Refund if you dislike. There's a Seamless Co-op mod that makes co-op infinitely better. If you want to play with friends you MUST try that.WHAT'S NEW:- Jumping. Has some invulnerabilty.- Huge new world. Some areas look amazing, some bland. 100+ hours per playthrough.- Lots of tombs/caves like Skyrim, filled with gimmicks and traps. - Respawn points when near bosses.- Bosses are more brutal than ever before. They like to spawn multiple projectiles or buddies whilst attacking, and often have huge movesets with very fast and delayed attacks.- New abilties, spells, etc. Apply and swap weapon abilities, which are tied to scaling.- Miracles & Pyros have been merged into Incantations. Both these & Sorcery are mostly new spells, but there are many Dark Souls spells.- Spirit summon system (find & upgrade them). It makes bosses extremely easy. But if you don't use them, bosses can be a nightmare.- Horseback combat, in open world areas only. Horseback heavy weapon R2 is OP.- 3d assets are mostly new.- Time of day, weather.WHAT'S NOT:- Looks, sounds & feels like Dark Souls 3.- Combat is mostly the same, but with stuff added.- Melee weapons mostly have the same movesets, anims, etc.- Weapon upgrading is like DS1. +25 max for regular weapons, +10 for special.- Some fights have summonable NPCs, ala Dark Souls.- Multiplayer is same as before (summon/dismiss) with summoning pools to make matchmaking easier. It's easier to recover flasks than before.OPEN WORLD:- You can explore freely. Many people are doing completely different things. I don't believe that's necessarily an ""open world"" benefit, though. You could do that in previous Souls games. The world is just way bigger now.- Doesn't add anything that couldn't have been done without.- Some areas feel very empty and take forever to traverse. Some have warp/respawn points everywhere, some don't. It's easy to miss warp points.- Items that could be bought from merchants in other games now require gathering/crafting yourself.- It's not like Genshin/Skyrim where you find something new every few moments. No random encounters. But it feels less empty than BoTW.- In multiplayer, play area is limited. You can't use horse mount or warp.- Platforming is often required to move from higher to lower ground. They could've just added ramps/bridges.- Dying in open world (usually from inconsistent fall damage) is the worst. Running back takes forever.CHARACTER CREATION:- Very early in, you can change appearance FOR FREE with NO LIMITATIONS.- Over-complicated sliders like previous games.- Better faces than previous games, if you master the sliders.- Presets are hideous, esp. females.- NO thin eyebrows.- Female voices all sound like the same middle-aged person.- Cannot adjust neck size or remove fat double-chin.- Hairstyles look better, but you may end up only using ones that cover eyebrows.- Color wheel. Pick any color.- Most outfits seem to only have male versions. Other than long dresses, there're maybe 2 feminine outfits in the entire game. There are no outfits like Desert Sorc, Dusk/Rhea's sets, Fume Sorc, Black Witch.- Female player models are inhumanly flat in the chest. I'm not talking about armor. Thin cloth tops are ultra flat. Some have textured depth, yet are flat from the side.- Some head/chests can be modified to remove parts (eg. cape). Can't remove scarf or hip armor though.- You can respec infinitely, if you have the item for it.PROBLEMS I'VE SEEN CONFUSE MANY:- After the intro, you get a long black screen. It's not a bug.- The game doesn't say how to enter/exit the hub.- In all languages, gender is ""Body Type: Type A - Buff Body or Type B - Slender Body"". It's the first thing you see when you start the game, and it says it 3 TIMES. Obviously a mid-dev change b/c ""male/female"" is used everywhere else.- Many players forget what they were doing last play. Some completely forget about the hub and don't visit for months.OTHER PROBLEMS:- Environmental objects and floor height/slope often mess with hitboxes. Was never a problem in other Souls games.- Easy to miss NPC quest chains and be locked out until next playthrough.- Cutscenes often freeze briefly when changing camera angles.- Mouse sometimes locks gamepad buttons when alt-tabbing.- Can't change accept/cancel buttons.- Can't disable VSync, chromatic aberration or the vignette.- In some fights, lock-on forces you to change target regardless of settings, and gets you killed.- Controls sometimes unresponsive. Likely caused by input lag. I'm using a 1ms monitor.- Pacing/balance is bad. If you get stuck, you can explore and come back, but that makes you OP for everything else.- If you follow the main story instead of doing side stuff, you'll often find you have later upgrade items but not earlier ones.- Some bosses with 2 main phases are very tedious and time-consuming in phase 1, then insta-kill you in phase 2, making it especially annoying to learn. This was a thing in Sekiro, but Sekiro phase 1s weren't as long or repetitive, and you could revive 1-2 times during the fight.- Regardless of stats, in late game you will do low-ish damage and die very easily.- Depending on playstyle, you need to play a specific way to beat some encounters, eg. if you're a mage and a boss has high magic def, you need to find a way to do physical damage. This can be a problem because chances are you won't have the items you need to change weapon or setup.- Summoned players are leveled down to match host. Boss HP multiplies per player (but not summon spirit). Host often gets killed by bosses quickly, meaning everyone needs to reconnect. Why co-op over spirits then?- Fall damage/deaths are often inconsistent.- I've heard many complaints about exploration being pointless because the rewards are useless. They should've made rewards an exchangeable currency, instead of items for specific builds.",0

Negative,"I'm just echoing the chorus here, but it is beyond frustrating that a PC port can be this subpar in the year 2022. This wouldn't have been acceptable 10 years ago, let alone now.For reference, I am running an NVidia RTX 2070 Super and a Ryzen R5 3600, which I have seen mentioned frequently as a setup that should not have performance issues, but does. My performance is ABSOLUTELY UNACCEPTABLE for a release of this profile, and it is NOT something that upgrading components would necessarily even be able to solve (see DigitalFoundry's video on the issues).A game shouldn't need half a dozen desperate out of game ""fixes"" to (maybe) work, and, while it is great if those fixes work for some, it doesn't change the fact that the developer deserves every bit of relevant negative feedback.Furthermore, not only does the game lag and stutter visually, it ALSO has a strange issue with input lag or something that past FS games like DS3 did not have. There are many accounts of players complaining about unresponsive rolls, or actions like rolling/weapon switching coming out way after getting hit. This makes the game frustrating to play even when it is not chugging and stuttering.ALSO, not only is the PC launch unacceptable on its own, it's extra wack because many early reviewers got accused of dishonesty or covering up performance issues to cash in on the hype, since the version that they played and reviewed was not the the same build as the one everyone got at launch and likely had different performance (EAC implementation, driver updates, day 1 patch, etc.)The developer is DIRECTLY responsible for this mismatch that caused honest content creators who were enthusiastic about their game to get flamed and accused of shilling, and frustrating players who bought the game on day 1 based on these reviews of a different build.AND THEN there's the fact that the Japanese reviews are full of complaints that their version of the game arbitrarily released at $80 USD for seemingly no justifiable reason. Charging any amount for a port this half-baked is shameful, let alone charging a premium for it.Overall, I'm not even surprised, just disappointed. Not just in the developers, but in the asinine segment of the player base that tries to cover up and deny issues, despite the developers themselves acknowledging them. Acceptance and tacit encouragement of these kinds of embarrassing technical shortcomings is why we are still seeing releases like this.EDIT: It has also become clear that the game was literally not finished at launch, with multiple side quest chains being completed in later patches, and significant bug fixes being made in the first couple of weeks. Normally, this would not be that big of a deal, but given how often other high-profile games do this and get flak for it, contrasted with the heaping praise this game has received, I do think it is relevant and worth mentioning.EDIT 2: I have now played/watched enough of the game to form a more concrete opinion on the actual contents of the game, and I have to say that even in that regard, in many ways, I am disappointed. While the scale and presentation of the world are certainly impressive, it's very disappointing to see how much of the lore and worldbuilding is recycled from their previous games, namely Dark Souls 1-3, Bloodborne, and Sekiro. All of those games set themselves apart and felt unique, while Elden Ring just kind of feels like a chaotic, lazy mash-up. The gameplay is also very disappointing in how much it just feels like an iteration on Dark Souls 3.To me, Sekiro stood out as a complete mechanical overhaul of the legacy Dark Souls combat system to address the many issues that cropped up as the DS series had increasingly become more and more about the action combat against the bosses. Sekiro as a game went all in on the 1v1 action game design, and the game was designed such that you could feel good about beating more or less all of the bosses regardless of what small build variations you chose, (prosthetic tools, arts, etc) because the primary core of the combat system (the katana stuff) was universal. It was utterly refreshing in that way, and gave me a lot of hope for their future games.Now, I'm not saying that I expected or wanted Elden Ring's combat system to be just like Sekiro's, BUT it still feels like an extremely disappointing step backwards. Sure, there are certainly IMPROVEMENTS over Dark Souls 3, but at the same time, the ISSUES with Dark Souls 3's combat have actually been EXACERBATED by those improvements as well, due to Elden Ring's boss AI and encounter design. Because the combat mechanics have become more sophisticated, and the boss AI is more aggressive and punishingly erratic than ever, the game really, really feels like it rewards certain builds and punishes others. You generally want the classic speedy R1 spam (now with huge Bleed procs!), the classic tank and spank that can block everything (now with Guard Counters!), or one of those meme builds that can decimate bosses in seconds.Personally, I'm really, really not a fan of games that, on the surface, advertise significant customization and freedom in character builds, but then harshly punish deviation from the most effective options in actual gameplay. I had hoped that Elden Ring would serve as a foil to Sekiro, focusing more on ""freedom"" (freedom of world exploration, freedom of builds, etc.) as opposed to Sekiro's ""structure"" (more linear and narratively-driven, more tightly choreographed fight mechanics designed around the core combat), but in the end it just feels like an ugly hybrid that can't decide what it wants to be, in all aspects.",0
Negative,"This game isn't the 'masterpiece' that people are giving it credit for. Before going any further, keep in mind that my experience with Fromsoft games is very limited. Fanboys, please spare me the hate and vitriol. I do not have any issues with performance. I run a RTX3070 at 3440x1440 and play on maxed out settings. No problem. My main gripes with the game are entirely based upon co-op. This game is NOT true co-op. You can either summon a friend into your world or be summoned into theirs. The process is clunky and slow (when it works), and even when you do join up with a friend there are annoyingly frequent drops / disconnects. This is especially frustrating when you are working through an area and get close to a key point like a boss fight or a rest spot.Someone drops and you get to start all over. If you are exploring with a friend and find a dungeon, you can't enter it together. Instead you have to disband the party, then you both have to make it to the entrance of the dungeon (this typically means that the cooperator will have to travel some distance), go inside, activate the rest spot, join up again once inside, automatically disband after beating the boss of the area, then join each other again. Tedious is an understatement, and bear in mind that is when things work properly! Furthermore, only the 'host' of the game can activate new rest spots, called Graces. (All of the terminology in this game is non-standard and weird.) Only the host can find and pick up special items scattered throughout. The cooperator(s) can only pick up basic crafting items from the environment and some drops from enemies. Also, if you are in your friend's world and you beat a boss, you don't get the special rewards for the boss fight. Basically what all of this means is that if you are playing co-op with a friend and trying to progress at the same rate you essentially have to do everything twice, switching off who is the host - which is extremely time-consuming, especially considering how massive this game is and the fact that if you are playing co-op nobody gets to use a mount. Why? Who knows? The best part is when you and your friend finally make some progress in an area and then the world gets invaded by another player character, usually sweaty try-hard who is level 500 and geared to the teeth. You cannot opt out of invasions whatsoever. At best you can buy an item that will automatically summon another player to assist you when invaded, but usually by the time they even arrive, you're dead. Also, this game is INCREDIBLY grindy. I cannot stress this point enough! The ONLY way to not have absolute trash stats is to find the best grind spot you can and grind your butt off for as long as you can tolerate it, and even then the benefits you get from leveling are so small and incremental - so small that it barely feels like you're getting any more powerful. If you play the game without grinding at all I seriously have no idea how you'd ever not be weak as hell or beat the game because it seems like it is required. Last but not least, several other things that annoy me about the game: it's very easy to miss crucial conversations with NPCs, there's no quest log / journal, the story makes no sense, many locations are in spots where you have to take extremely long roundabout paths to reach due to cliffs (it seems like Fromsoft makes every effort to make the game more annoying and tedious), enemy attacks frequently clip right through walls and other solid objects and hit you, it is very hard to gauge distance to enemies sometimes, magic tends to have a very short range, bosses have huge attack ranges and AOEs and can easily 1-2 shot you, poise makes no sense, one enemy in a certain area will be drastically more powerful than the exact same enemy in a different area, enemies can hit you on the ground but rarely can you hit them on the ground, armor options are extremely sparse and nothing seems that great, lots of dialogue and plot pieces are very vague, the music is mediocre at best, and much of the game involves taking the time to look up stuff online because it's not explained in-game. There are a lot of hidden mechanics to the game which are not explained AT ALL in the game. It's not a terrible game but the co-op is janky and it is a grind-a-thon. The funny part is that apparently there is a ""New Game +"" mode that you can start after beating the game. You get to start the game over with much harder difficulty and everything you've uncovered on the map is gone! Oh boy! Doesn't that sound like fun? (Seriously, who would be drawn to this?) My plan,along with my friend, is to basically look up everything and do it together because finding out everything organically would either take hundreds of hours or even be next to impossible, because some NPC plot hooks make no sense and unless you routinely re-visit areas you've already been to and cleared, you're probably not going to make it any further in those side quests. I'm going to look up where to find the talismans I want, the armor I want, the weapons I want, etc. Even then it will still take forever because like I said earlier, when you play co-op you have to do everything twice and you don't get a mount. At first I was put off by the artificial difficulty of the game. Then I kinda accepted it and could enjoy the experience for what it is. At this point I'm kinda bored with it already. I still have a ton of locations I haven't yet visited and I kinda just want to get it done and over with.",0

Negative,"don't really care about the stuttering/performance issues. that can be ironed out.however, i do have a problem with from literally rehashing 80% of the assets from the dark souls universe. the story and lore also feels extremely identical to dark souls; difference being a few words are changed here and there. it honestly felt like i was playing a cheap dark souls rip-off.only real difference is the game is open-world, and has a few superficial gimmicks like having a horse, crafting and the ability to jump. the combat mechanics are ripped straight from ds3 so i'm not sure why i wouldn't just play ds3 again (actually i'm going to refund this and just replay ds3 lol).honestly, if youre desperate for more dark souls and have already replayed the shit out of ds1/2/3, bloodborne, demons souls etc; you'll probably really enjoy this. otherwise i wouldnt recommend it",0
Negative,"Base game: Outdated and obtuse but serviceable combat within a very detailed and pretty hellscape. Decent game for everyone that I would recommend.DLC: Unreasonable combat that clashes with its already outdated mechanics, but it's an even prettier hell of a world. The DLC is NOT something I'd recommend to most people.I liken the Elden Ring experience to eating a spicy dish. Fromsoftware's games have always been a bit obtuse, and just like spicy food it's not really for everyone. So it's a bit of delight when they get so much recognition. They make good curry.The base Elden Ring game is a bit of a foray into newness for them because they haven't ever made a world this big yet, and that comes with advantages and disadvantages. For one, the world it's set in is gorgeous and fun to really just traverse in; that however means there's a whole bunch of empty space not occupied by corridors and enemies. It also extends the amount of time for a single run for the average player, which depending on who you are is a good or a bad thing. Overall I think the game has really good presentation thanks to its visual language, its visages, the music that flows between ambient and bombastic when needed, and just the strange and mysterious elements that fascinate a lot of their audience.The DLC is all of these things and more, and that's not necessarily a good thing; just like how it's not always a good thing to make a dish spicier. The expansion adds a whole new map that's a bit more compact, but it shares a lot of the same characteristics of the base game. It's really pretty and I like how a lot of enemies and architecture that just juxtapose itself with that of the base game. The story that unfolds uncovers a few of the things that never really got an explanation at all, and you meet characters are much more likeable albeit their brief appearances.What's absolutely unacceptable is their decision to make combat so unbalanced and nonsensical. The base game occasionally has issues where enemies would just spin on the spot and hit you, and that unintuitive and silly implementation is everywhere in the expansion. They also have been entertaining this obtuse way of breaking people's reflexive response by delaying attacks in awkward ways, and it's excruciating egregious in the DLC. On top of that, they decided tough enemies should just attack endlessly without any good indicators of when their attacks end. They basically broke every rule of a real time combat game and instead of making them some pioneer into the genre, it makes Elden Ring's combat unreasonable. The DLC exacerbates this problem instead of solving it, and that alone makes me incapable of recommending this to anyone despite how much I love the rest of the game.I think Fromsoft cooked a bit too hard this time around.",0
Negative,"I excitedly launched elden ring, to be greeted by black bars and a 60 frame cap.Much to my dismay, there were no settings for a frame cap. No settings for aspect ratio. I suppose it was wrong to assume competent studios still existed. Having the engine and maybe physics tied to frame rate? Most indie devs know this is a big no no, and has been for the greater part of the last 2 decades.Big thumbs down because the lack of attention to these 2 problems is unjustifiable honestly. The game is still fun, and I would ve liked to play with friends, but the only way to actually fix ultrawide and frame limit is with in-memory edits, which EAC will keep a close eye on, likely resulting in a ban for me. I don t plan to make an EAC bypass for a game like this. Hopefully, though, the devs come out with some fixes for the frame rate and ultrawide. Hell, myself and many others were able to fix this problem in hours, and I come from a C#/Java background. Any disregard for this would just show how truly incompetent FromSoft is. I don t think anyone would mind if you get a decent vpn and download it from a non-paid platform, as the game is already in those places, along with fixes.

Plus, it will be very hard to mod 21:9 in thanks to the use of EasyAnticheat.Fromsoft, fix your shit, get widescreen support in, and you're gonna get a positive, constructive review from me. Right now, the port is unacceptable.",0
Negative,"I was originally going to write a positive review but after playing currently for 113 hours I'm honestly starting to think about quitting and never playing this game again and I'll explain my reasons why.First off the game is just too big. I wanted to explore everything, kill every boss, explore every dungeon things like that but I don't think that's going to happen now considering how easy it is to get lost with no points of interests or landmarks to help you remember.I don't know where to go just to progress the main story. The bonfires look like they point you where you need to go on the map but when I follow them I end up running into more optional stuff. People complained about yooka laylee's worlds being too big but at least in that I could purposely leave items behind for the time being and come back later when I had explored the rest of the branching paths.The map is almost completely useless. Their is nothing to help you remember where you need to go or want to go except for marking it or placing one of those symbols on the map which isn't really helpful cause you can't put little notes or anything next to them so if you have like 10 markers you will eventually lose track of why you put them there in the first place so get ready to either write down where all the shit is you need to remember or try and remember but get a headache from trying to remember 50 different places you need to go.It just made me appreciate a game like BOTW even more since in that game you always knew where to go and you had a checklist of sorts of what you have and haven't done and you could cover a'lot of land if you got a good place to glide from. Elden ring is just shit at open world and if they make a sequel they should take notes from BOTW since that game knew how to do it right.If your not getting lost your most likely spending an hour or more trying to get through a dungeon cause the enemies and bosses one shot you and a'lot of the enemies and bosses are badly designed and cheap. It's not about git gud or stupid shit like that it's learn how to fucking design enemies and bosses properly. Leveling up also feels useless and I don't feel I'm becoming stronger. Just feels like luck sometimes weather you kill an enemy or not.In what world does it make sense to have a dragon mini boss in volcano manor have 10,000 hp more than most normal bosses in the game and spew lava everywhere while running into you at the same time and can do it up to 3 times while there is already lava everywhere else on limited ground. It's not a hard but fair challenge it's just straight up bullshit.Speaking of bosses get ready to run into the same ones constantly. Like for example I've so far found fallingstar beast 3 fucking times. I would of waited 10 more years or however long it would of taken if they made every boss different and unique. Feels more like quantity over quality.Dungeons are no better either. I've gone through the same goddam mine area about 20 times now and it's always the same shit. Brown walls with mine digging enemies just a different layout.The combat is fun but I'm still using the greatsword which I found like 2 days after playing to be the best weapon for me and everything I run across seems to be worse and from what I've read online it looks like the greatsword is one of the best weapons I'm gonna get personally. Same goes for armour and shields I've been using the same shit for about a week now and nothing better except for 2 pieces of armour I found. There's just no sense of progression either in story or gameplay.Everything else like the music the graphics is fine but their are a'lot of technical issues as well since the game can crash whenever it wants among other things but other than that idk how this game got GOTY and 10/10 and shit like that it's definitely not worth it and more like a 6/10. Hopefully the sequel if they make one can address these issues.",0
Negative,"FIX INVITING FRIENDS FOR CO-OP. THIS SUMMONING STUFF IS TERRIBLE. WHAT A WASTE OF A FEATURE.If we die you auto go back to your own world, this is so bad. Why would you design it like this KNOWING that you can invite friends but anything could kill you and immediately have to start the process all over again. So bad.UPDATE: On another note of this feature, We have a friend who died in our world, went back to there own world and now none of the characters can be interacted with. He has uninstalled, reinstalled, checked the files and nothing. That's how bad this really is.on Another note. The game itself from a Solo stand point is great.

Negative,"Elden Ring does what Dark Souls did but quantity > quality. FromSoftware has taken the formula that has gotten them where they are now and put forward no innovation toward it aside from plopping it into an open world without putting any effort to truly merge it's own style with an open world.Playing this game made me really think I hate open world games. I don't like Skyrim, Fallout, or The Witcher. However Zelda Breath of the Wild and Death Stranding are some of the greatest games I have ever played. So what gives? What gives is Elden Ring falls more into the Skyrims, the Fallouts, the The Witchers, etc. I guess Open World RPGs? As much as this game gets describes as Dark Souls meets Breath of the Wild I really can't see that being any further from the truth. BotW for me did something that made me realise Open World games are the future. I am not the only one who has realised this, Pokemon realised it, Dark Souls realised it, Final Fantasy realised it. Even a series I dearly love, the Tales of series realised it. Every game wants to be open world but none of them do anything to stand out it's all just in a pile of sameness that I can't help but hate to see and Elden Ring is no exception. In truth I understand why people call Elden Ring a masterpiece, they think The Witcher 3 was a masterpiece. This game is going to crush that but that as a standard is so utterly low.So because I rant I will try to divide my thoughts the best I can into sections.Lots to do, little of it fun:Recycling. Oh dearest recycling. The truth is it's what gets games released. For a game to be a large as an Elden Ring and have unique boss encounters at each cave or mine or ruin would simply require too much development time. However there is actually a solution to this. Don't do it. Just get the good stuff out there and call it a game. I feel like there's this perception that the more hours you can get out of a game the higher value it is. I couldn't help but feel a clear distinction between doing required story tied locations and the entire rest of the game. I wish a cave was as fulfilling as going through Stormveil Castle, but it's not. I don't know if it's possible for it to be so. That's why I say this game is quantity > quality. Caves/mines/ruins/graves/whatever other locations that are the same walk through a place with little to no enemy diversity until you reach the end and fight a boss you already learned how to kill 20 hours ago is repetitive, it simply is. They all are such a big part of this game though, am I expected to skip them if I don't enjoy it? Then I am just playing Dark Souls but with boring horse riding in between the cool places.Exploration is kinda pointless:Here's my issue. Going to a cool looking tower or house rarely yields anything as rewarding as a ruin. So it would seem, at least to me, that by design this game is encouraging you to look for the same copy pasted landmarks to explore those instead of actually interesting uniquely designed landmarks. I noticed this early game, I kept going place to place but wasn't really getting anything, no loot, no hints for side quests, no interesting enemy encounters, nothing. Until I noticed a trend: There's these ruins that always look the same and always have good stuff at them. So I started going to those. Not because I wanted to, but because the game taught me to. I don't want to go to another Ruin, they get boring incredibly quick when they're the same design and always just have a staircase leading down to a boss or a chest.Everything's underground:Why is so much of this game underground? It feels like this game's world was created, and it's a great world I cannot deny that, but then they realised they needed to fill it with stuff but that's kinda hard to do once you've laid everything out so they just put a bunch of stuff underground where they can start doing whatever they want. Caves are underground, graves are underground, ruins narrow down to just being underground. It legitimately seems like a cop out. Why are there so few field bosses on the surface that actually belong or are unique? Why do I fight 10 Night Cavalries and Death Birds? Give me more Commander O'Neills!Travel vs. Exploration and why I don't like Fast Travel:If I can, within reason, I will play games without fast travel. It's how I prefer games, I don't like my exploration of a cool world to come down to menu interactions. I like that travel even if it takes awhile so long as it's enjoyable. Elden Ring travel is boring. I don't mean exploration, I mean travel, going from point A to point B. Compare this to the pioneer walking simulator, Death Stranding. Death Stranding is far more travel than it is exploration so it is a perfect case study of how to do travel correctly. In Death Stranding your objective is to get cargo from point A to point B, but it's what is along that journey that makes the game beautiful. You have a huge stack of packages on your back that you have to balance and wisely traverse the harsh terrain to keep safe. Along your travels there are dozens of packages on the floor lost for you to return to their destination so you might see one for the Roboticist and how convenient that's only a small detour from your path to the Geologist. Might as well pick it up to get to her but wait now there's a balance issue with your cargo and you need to organise it. All of that gameplay for your travel is in place to make you not even want fast travel.Now back to Elden Ring you get on your horse and ride. There's not interesting enough movement and there's nothing to do along the journey, so there is no reason to do it making everyone cut through the game as quickly as possible through a menu interaction that places them across the world. It just feels pointless to have this really cool world FromSoftware has made when you're just fast travelling all across it.Elden Ring has all the great qualities of Dark Souls:Dark Souls blew me away, I really got a special feeling that the game was doing something really spectacular and it did. The truth is this game doesn't majorly lack any of that. That's why I'm not surprised people love this game, my problem with it lies in how spread thin that stuff is. Going through Stormveil Castle isn't any worse than going through Blighttown, but after Blighttown is Sen's Fortress then Anor Londo. It is quality after quality. After Stormveil Castle you walk around a giant world that's not as engaging until you find the next big place to go to just to match the quality that every game before it had. It's that quantity > quality. Elden Ring is Dark Souls but you have to watch all the filler episodes.It's 2022, but Elden Ring doesn't make it feel like it (coldest take here):The instability is simply embarrassing. The lack of camera improvements or at least options to disable mario camera where strafing moves the camera especially when there's people using a mouse. The netcode? I can barely ever connect and when I do it's such an awful experience with me hitting the enemy but not doing damage and the exact same thing happening for my opponent because of latency. How is this stuff just being excused and ignored? Enemies can hit through walls even fog walls, but if your sword even slightly pricks a wall it will deflect. KB+M controls are horrendous. Balance is not even in the building. It makes me really question how much this game has improved upon the Dark Souls 1 I played last year. It doesn't feel improved, I excused that game for being old but this one should not be excused in the same ways but it largely is.I'll leave it at that. Having as many hours as I have leaves me with a lot of thoughts, and that's what this is. It's some of my thoughts. I desperately wanted to love this game, but I didn't. Not even close.",0
Negative,"Let me start off by saying that I am a ""seasoned souls veteran"", having played all of the Souls games (inc. Bloodborne) and Sekiro with hundreds of hours in PvP and PvE. And i also hate casuals begging for an easy mode. Especially game journalists. Another word of warning: this isn't a proper review, this is a rant written way past midnight. Now, enjoy.Elden Ring is a great game. But it still has flaws, many of them.Most egregious is the cheap feeling of everything. Be it in enemies, movesets, scaling, the environment and especially bosses.The open world may look pretty from afar, but traversing it is a chore. It only serves to increase the travel time from point A to B until you unlock relevant grace to skip it via loading screen. Things like cut-off artifical feeling ledges that kill you where its not obvious on the map where you should go, so you have to ride along the edge for 20 minutes until you find the ""GO HERE"" path of brilliant game design. It often leads you to a dungeon with neat theme and then a boss that has nothing to do with said theme and is one of the ones they copy-paste all over the place.Speaking of the bosses, they remind me of Sekiro's bosses with their fast, long combos, delayed attacks and split second feints. But, this is not Sekiro. Blocking, rolling and attacking costs stamina which you cannot regain with a ""perfect"" input like in Sekiro, which means that oftentimes you run out of stamina when dodging each blow of a bosses long combo. Getting hit once, means losing a heal. And the long attack chains don't reward you for going through them; there is no way to break posture without attacking.I feel like fromsoftware saw the praise of Sekiro's combat and decided to implement some of that in Elden Ring. But Sekiro bosses don't work with souls dodgerolling.The attacks of even mooks come out in flurries, easily stunlocking you into oblivion. Many delays don't feel natural. It all makes for unintuitive, frustrating gameplay.They also took much from Bloodborne, such as the flailing and screeching. And from Dark Souls 2 aswell, such as the lingering hitboxes and massive shockwaves that deal full damage.Many people have pointed out the tons of soul-crushing repetition in this game, so i'll just give it an honourable mention here.Past the capital, enemy health gets tuned up to ridiculous values. small rats have more than 1400 health. That is equivalent to a player with over 40 points in vigor. and its RATS that have it.Another MASSIVE issue is the balance of the game, especially in PvP.""Oh yeah, PvP, that exists"" - Probably MiyazakiRemember when the innovative multiplayer of Demon's Souls was plastered all over the box art? In Elden Ring, they decided to take a giant SHIT over it all. Cooping in the World isn't seamless and constantly gets interrupted by disconnects, Invading is a total chore where skill goes to die and NOBODY has fun. All the things that made the previous games so special: gone, shattered.And the messages? Might aswell turn those off because all you're going to see is the same old tired joke.Yes, Elden Ring might have quantity. But it lacks quality. And most of all, it lacks real engagement that keeps players coming back. Once you've seen it, you've seen it and there is nothing left.Don't get me wrong, in some parts Elden Ring is a good game.But. It isn't Dark Souls 4.",0
Negative,"It's finally time for me to stop acting like this series is still trying to provide the experience it did for me in it's initial 2 releases. This game is for people who enjoy basic, albeit, beautiful open worlds with copy and paste tier points of interest to explore for a minor or useless reward, rhythm game challenge bosses making up most of the boss roster that feel indistinguishable from each other mechanically and basically dark souls 3 again with a different set of waifu characters to fawn over. If you have liked the last couple of games in the soulsbourne series, including sekiro, then you will probably love this game without issue but to those who saw and still feel the value in games like demon souls and what it did uniquely and what fromsoft have seemed to move away from since then, then you will probably not get anything form this game as i have not. It's hard moving on from another series once beloved to you but I realize that it's not worth trying to stick it out for a series you know is never give again that thing that made it stand out from the crowd in the first place.",0
Negative,"Mediocre PC port with performance issues, an awful UI, and poor PC controls/camera.Beyond the technical issues, it's honestly pretty overhyped for the final product. It's pretty. It's Dark Souls 3 with nice looking (but fairly pointless) open sections instead of loading screens. The comparisons to Breath of the Wild by reviewers are hilariously inaccurate as the game really has no form of typical open world exploration due to lack of a climbing system, no swimming, etc.If you're a Soulsbourne super-fan, you'll probably love it. It has a jump button. Everyone else, probably wait for patches.",0
Negative,"This game hates those who play it. It's an anti-game. And if you're not already familiar with the Souls-genre, you will regret this purchase.This game is not a 10/10 - it's a 8/10 for a Souls-game, but a 7/10 tops in general. And that 7 hinges on you liking hard, unfair games.Why? To explain that, I need to explain why I said that this game is an anti-game, because this game is good. it just hates the player.First and foremost and something that isn't mentioned NEARLY enough, and makes me wish i could get a refund - this game is ALWAYS ONLINE. Even though in the past you could play dark souls offline, in this game you must be able to establish a connection to their servers, and just today I've been disconnected from this almost entirely single player game multiple times.Second, it's a fucking time-vampire. Very quickly, you'll get to a point in the game where it takes 10k+ exp to level ONE time. and most enemies drop under 100 exp, unless you're doing certain farming techniques. ONE stat point does almost nothing in this game. But speaking of stat points, if you mess up your build, you either have to make do, restart the game, or trudge HALFWAY through the game before unlocking the ability to USE AN EXCEEDINGLY RARE ITEM to reset your stats.Third, continuing from stats, they've made certain stats entirely broken. Both in the sense of being useless and op. Strength, for example, doesn't increase your carry weight AT ALL. But strength builds need carry weight, so they automatically have to double-dip their stat needs by needing an absurd amount of endurance to be at all viable. Unlike dexterity, which has no such need as most dexterity weapons and set-ups are light. Sorcery is a BAD joke, while faith and incantations are amazing. Pyromancy has been rolled into faith, further making it the de-facto spell stat, for no particular reason.Fourth, Again - this game hates the player. You will have no idea where to go or what to do half the time you're playing. The grace-sites generally point you in the right direction to progress the story, but beyond that, good fucking luck. Speaking of hating the player, cheap deaths are everywhere in this game. It's been said before that souls-games are unique in that they don't general have many cheap deaths but that's just not true, and is even less true in this game. Enemies are so fast and strangely agile, so unless you're running a dexterity build with a quick roll, they will out-position you every time. Massive enemies can be hiding, and if you're not prepared (or even if you are in most cases) can one shot you.Fifth, this series and genre as a whole is seriously showing it's age, By that, I mean it's not evolving with the times. Why can my character not climb up this waist high wall? Why is the platforming SO FUCKING AWFUL? Why do I need to rest at a grace-site to restore my potions - unless you luck out and arbitrarily ""clear an area"", or find a beetle? Why does the targetting system and camera suck SO BADLY, still, after so many games from fromsoft?Sixth, a continuation from my last point really. the controls are absolutely terrible. The game is so bloated, you have not only your basic buttons (attack, block, dodge, etc) but you also have scrolling menus on the d-pad. and now, another ADDITIONAL menu on the d-pad for your quick use items. Two-handing your weapons is in its own context sensitive mode now aswell, further adding to the bloat. This isn't specifically an elden ring problem, but these controls are bloated as hell. The carryover from multiple button presses really makes combat feel absolutely terrible sometimes too.I can go on all day, really. There's so many weird issues, both big and small that I can't possibly list them all. It's not a bad game - it looks good and mostly feels good to play, but someone has to call out the bad parts of the game because it's not for everyone, and it's certainly not a 10/10.Edit TL;DR - I've come to the conclusion that this is fromsofts worst souls-game. It takes the speed and combat style from Bloodborne and applies that to the enemies, meanwhile your own speed and combat style is still just slow, clunky Dark Souls. That's why the combat feels so wrong. Bosses, Mini-Bosses and tough enemies fly around the battlefield, meanwhile you simply don't get enough i-frames from your clunky-ass roll and can't retaliate quickly enough unless you're running a Dexterity build with a fast weapon.",0
Negative,"I wanted to like this game and was excited by the early reviews, but now that I've played it a bit I feel really underwhelmed and frankly bored. The game is a one-trick pony. That trick is that the combat is challenging. And it's quite visually attractive. But that's about all it's got going for it.If I worked on the world design and visual art side, I'd be pissed that my beautiful work wasn't supported by any of the things that make a truly good game. Like writers, and world-building and character development. Heck, there aren't even any characters to speak of. The tiny number of NPCs have no personality and mostly only show up for one scene before disappearing forever. Everything else in the world is inexplicably and implacably hostile. As a result, there's no sense of why you're on the journey you're on, nothing at stake. Your own character is silent. In fact the whole world is pretty silent, so I guess we can add music and SFX to the list of departments that must have been laid off. The open world is pretty, but it's aimless and pointless and you pretty quickly run out of things to do. It's just. boring.Not to mention confusing. The game seems to go out of its way not to explain the world, the story, the game mechanics or anything else. For the first few hours I anticipated that it was just a mysterious first act and things would eventually begin to make sense. Nope. That seems to be the whole game. Your character silently and joylessly fighting anything that moves for no particular reason, with no more than a dozen lines of bad dialog that leaves you more annoyed than anything.I didn't have the performance issues others complained about. But even still, it is a bad PC port. The controls, especially in menus, are needlessly counter-intuitive. Press 'G' to open your map. Want to close your map? Don't press 'G' again, because that just brings up a special dialog explaining that pressing G was the wrong thing to do. And the way the game treats the escape key is frustratingly inconsistent. Sometimes it's a synonym for the main navigation keys E and Q, sometimes it does something totally different and undocumented.If you love the challenge of the combat, which is heavily timing based, you may enjoy this game. So it's basically Dance Dance Revolution with a sword. Actually, scratch that. DDR has more plot and the music is way better.I need to go play Horizon Zero Dawn again to remind myself that it is indeed possible to have an open-world game with compelling story, fun combat, and a functional PC port.",0

Negative,"While this game has arguably the best open world design since Witcher3 and Skyrim, the enemy boss design is mostly frustrating and the game suffers from greatly unbalanced enemies. Enemy types that combo almost indefinitely and hit like a truck are dominating the balanced enemies with hard hitting but slow attacks, where one actually sees fair openings inbetween.A LOT has been great in this game and there is fun to be had. However ultimately, there are so many Quality of Life issues that make this game unnecessarily frustrating. That along with unfun enemies and a refreshing (one of the best groundworks, but just no finished thought) but also exploration-punishing quest systems that can't be maneuvered without relying on internet guides and frequently leads to acidentally missed or failed quests through seemingly completely unrelated actions on the other side of the map, doesn't let me recommend the game.Obviously I had my money's worth from it and there is a great game in there but it is buried by frequent game design decisions that are just frustrating for frustrations sake.Get the game if you like world exploration and design but for QoL and combat done right, visit Nioh2 (which conversely has a rather blend world/level design but one of the best thought through combat out there and nearly not a single game decision that could need a QoL overhaul)",0
Negative,"I was on the fence about buying Elden Ring, but I really wanted a game with action combat and interesting bosses. How bad can it be, I thought? Well, I'm sure it's great for Soulsborne fans, but if (like me) you just wanted something that was exciting without being a slog, stay away. I'm not wholly unenthusiastic-the art direction and visual style is good, and if they fixed the numerous things I am about to list below as the problems I had, then I would genuinely enjoy the combat. I'm also told that previous games by this publisher used to be even less accessible, so progress, kind of, I guess?But there are a lot of flaws I've already butted into with only a few hours of playtime (anyone who wants to tell me to ""git gud"" or similar should be aware there is a special circle of Hell for those who demand people treat their leisure time like a job).-Co op with friends comes with mandatory PvP attackers you cannot opt out of. Also, no form of scaling is available to make co op with higher level friends more functional if you are starting out.-Currency and XP are the same thing, and both are lost on death. You can theoretically reclaim them, but only within a limited window, and there is no bank. Period.-If you die, in addition to the loss of resources already mentioned, you may not be able to get to the enemy that killed you to learn how to better deal with them for a while, because pulling too many enemies at once will just murder you so you need to approach every fight cautiously-and therefore time-consumingly. Add to this that the theoretically great build variety comes with all sorts of animation details you need to learn, and you're going to be spending a lot of time in loading screens and carefully approaching enemy camps and the like.-There are no difficulty settings of any kind, which would be a thing that would allow the good of the game to shine through without making it disrespect the player's time availability nearly so much.Overall, this is a game I very much want to like and simply cannot. More power to those who can, but I want to warn those who like me, were tempted by the acclaim into thinking it might be a decent casual dip of a game, rather than a lifestyle you adopt for months.Addendum: I was able to do a ton of external research and conversations with friends and get to the point where I am enjoying the game now. I stand by my original review, however, as the game should not require that level of external resource use.",0

From Software thought that instead of making enemies tougher in coop, they'd rather offer rewards to players for being douche bags and killing people. Because all you're doing is enticing people to ruin others' fun for no reason. If this is absolutely necessary then make a mode for people who like getting invaded and see how many people play it. People enjoy these games for the challenge but i think most of us can agree the invasion system should be able to be toggled on and off. This game is fantastic but please my friend and I will be having a blast with the challenge and the adventure then we get invaded by some meta weeaboo and just like that we both are miserable and quit out of the game as it ruins all the fun. If the invasion system is loved by the audience then see whos still using the system if you make it toggleable. It sucks i had to write this since i love this game but holy shit From Software please make invasions optional because the game is no longer fun with them.",0
Negative,"I try not to post negative reviews but this is such a huge letdown.The game runs really poorly on my PC, and it's the sort of PC that can run latest Assassin's Creed games on HIGH without a problem. But I could probably even deal with that. What I can't ignore is that enemies don't load - there are literally invisible foes attacking me! I can see their torches floating in the air in the distance sometimes. Now that's just taking the piss. Come on! I'm asking for a refund. I might return if this stuff gets fixed but right now I feel really quite angry and very disappointed (and I've played From Software's games since Daemons Souls so I consider myself a massive fan).",0
Negative,"Paid 60 bucks. After a 15-20 minute download went to launch game, and it doesn't open. Watched some YouTube tutorials and read articles for 1-2 hours, and still having the issue. Rated a 1/10 because I can't even play the game. I know it's a good game, but this is evidently annoying and I'm probably going to have to refund at this point.",0
Negative,"Can't use non-latin characters for a name Can't change a keyboard layout Can't start game. WTF, developers, did you learn how to make videogames following tutorials from 1970's? After yet another patch the game simply stopped launching. The quality of the game is a joke and even worse than Cyberpunk 2077. Insta-refund.",0
Negative,"The game is beyond perfect and I admit it, But the frame drops and the damn 60 FPS cap is gonna make me vomit. It is not fun to play every Soulsborne game at 60 FPS max just cuz the old man said so, not to mention that PC players don't get to play with Keyboard buttons and I am forced to press every button on keyboard just to memorize it. Hopefully they fix the bugs and add the Keyboard keys to the game!",0
Negative,"Enemies are invisible most of the time. Going through an area only to find I'm attacked by invisible spawns. Even when I do see something, even while fighting it, it de-renders in the middle of the fight but still there. Tried changing resolution, reducing graphics options, changing computer configurations outside the game, closing everything else out, nothing fixes this problem. There's no point playing a game this broken.",0
Negative,The game is so laggy I cant play it.the new dlc (which i was excited for) just broke the game for me even more! Fix the game!,0
Negative,Hard FPS drop at certain enemy attacks making it impossible to time rolls.Needs fixes before it's playable,0
Negative,"Game is poorly optimized even for a 30 series card, Fromsoftware are still technically inept when it comes to PC ports and just general optimization.",0
Negative,"Its not good. Anyone who likes this type of game is probably sad, lonely, a loser or all three.",0
Negative,even when I play offline the game lags really hard and multiplayer does not work it is contently disconnecting my friends and I and when we do stay connected we are constantly invaded. for a game that took 3 years to make and had 2 months after the beta it really sucks. I only recommend buying Elden Ring if it goes on sale.,0
Negative,"Right now, I can't recommend this game. I love From Software and their games, and I have no doubt this is a masterpiece, but the PC optimisation is terrible. I can deal with frame rate drops, but I can't even SEE the enemies - they're literally invisible until I restart the game and they can render. There is a mod which fixes this, but that then means you can't play online, which is a huge portion of the fun. From Software, please fix this!",0
Negative,"A profoundly beautiful and enchanting world. Unfortunately, due to inconsistent performance on the PC, I cannot recommend this game until it is improved. There are noticeable severe frame drops, or hitching, in a number of locations in the starting area. I did get 20 hours into the game before I found the problem unbearable, but for now I must, sadly, put this game down and hope it will be patched soon.",0
Negative,"You go into this game loving it, and by the last third of the game you leave it hating it at least in my experience. It seems a consensus forming that the latter bosses have very questionable design approaches. I didn't enjoy any of the latter bosses, they were chores to get rid of. Balance has some of the most absurd design philosophies I've seen - the preeminence of bleed and magic, the absolute kick in the gut that faith constantly gets with how many bosses are resistant to holy and how few are weak to it, the sluggish nature of souls gameplay really starting to show itself against hyper-reactive enemies.A game that drags on so long and gets so tedious at the end you just desperately want the game to end is not a good way to end a game.In all honestly if you buy it you will have a lot of fun and your money's worth. It's just come the late game the game falls apart and I have to disparage it for the design direction Fromsoft is taking. Of Dark Souls 1, 2, 3 and Nioh 2 - ER is with DS2 the worst when it comes to bosses but it also might be the most fun in the early game experience of a souls game.So it's tricky for me to recommend this. I both do recommend it and I don't recommend it. You'll easily get your $ spent per hour played and have fun, but the late game really poos the bed for me. That and there's some fundamental issues with the gameplay approach that really starts to wear on me.tl;dr? 2/3rds of the game are fun, 1/3rd of the game is miserable and the 2/3rds that is fun has some real tediousness in retrospect (recycled content).",0
Negative,"Game stutters and freezes mid play even after reducing all in game settings to minimum, closing all possible background applications, disabling steam overlay, clearing gpu caching, and optimizing gpu settings for the game. This is with an older PC that is still well above the ""minimum"" hardware for the game.Oh, and if you spend more than 2 hours trying to get this unstable excuse for a port to work, steam won't refund it.The game itself is otherwise what you would expect from fromsoft, just buy it on console instead.",0
Negative,"Hey it's a fun and beautiful game with great art style and stunning environments (although not quite current gen fidelity). It has that great combat style and frustratingly difficult gameplay that they've been recycling for years now, and that everyone loves. But the game is jank. I don't understand how reviews of this game can have so much praise while others are so harshly criticised. It's full of bugs, horrible design choices and straight up brokenness. People will get halfway through the game not even understanding half of the controls yet alone having changed the control system from the default, so that it actually works. The AI is the same broken AI they've always recycled.The multiplayer networking is ridiculously unstable.The items and effects system seem to randomly not work art times.The runes you leave behind when you die sometimes disappear.It's 2022 and enemies will still kill you by slashing through a wall.Is there even a story? Jank game, but hey it's tonnes of fun. 4.5/5",0
Negative,"Personally this game is not for me and unless you enjoy slow methodical combat I would not recommend it for others.Combat: The combat is dull, slow, and punishing. Every boss fight and most enemies in general are just about avoiding all their attacks and finding a tiny window to do some quick attacks in and repeat till they are dead. However the enemies attacks are incredibly punishing and sometimes completely unrelenting. Add in the fact that the bosses have large health pools, heal themselves, or otherwise take at best modest damage from your attacks unless you use a weapon that leaves damage over time via bleed.While there are shields in the game and guard counters (an empowered counter attack after blocking an attack) the game finds every possible way to discourage you from using them. Attacks that bleed you out regardless of them being blocked (losing 90% of your health after blocking 3 attacks for e.x.) or other status alignments that even in addition to ignoring your shield, ignore the evade rolls which give you alleged invulnerability frames otherwise called ""I-frames"". Leveling and increasing your character's power.The levels come slow and require a lot of souls (which doubles as a currency) but in the end don't empower or change your output to a significant degree. Each level lets you increase one stat by one point along with a minor increase to some defensive stats, or hp/mp/stamina. However even at level 60+ I didn't feel significantly stronger then my level 10 or 20 self. That being the only real differences I have noticed is a slight increase to hit points and stamina which means you don't die in one shot to everything. A pretty low bar in terms of powering a character up.Armor can't be upgraded and ends up feeling like well its better then wearing nothing or turns into a fashion show rather then a useful tool to help you conspire strategies to overcome powerful opponents. Also almost all the armor I have found is worse then my starting armor.Forced PvP:While I do congratulate the developers for taking one step in the correct direction allowing you to play elden ring solo or offline and not have to worry about non-consensual pvp they still have a step to take when it comes to CO-OP. When playing with a friend at nearly any time you will be invaded by players while just trying to play with friends. While you do outnumber these invaders it doesn't stop them from killing you or otherwise impeding your progress at any given time. There is no option to opt out of this experience and while this may be fun for some players I dare say most people go into a co-op mind set wanting to you know. CO-OP. NEVER force pvp its a recipe for disaster. While I understand Invasions are trying to use players as challenges to be defeated and over come its unwanted by a significant if not majority of the co-op population as players are treating as pvp rather then what the designer intended so they are min maxing every possible avenue to win. This wouldn't be such an issue if you could kick the invader out after losing a duel and moving on with your game but instead the host has to create a new game and restart all their progress if they can't defeat the invader.Pros:I enjoyed the open world that was full of stuff to do so if you ever felt like you were stuck on something you could always just go else where.There are a good variety of abilities and weapons to choose from and use.The aesthetics of the open world are pleasing despite being a dark Gothic dystopian world. If you enjoy dark soul's slow methodical combat and want a bigger world to explore its a good game but if you don't enjoy the tedium of its combat bosses make it a miserable experience even on a victory.",0

Negative,"Great game but not so great port. Negative review because I bought the game specifically to play online, but there is no ultrawide monitor support and I am forced to either use a mod that bans me from playing online, or deal with black bars on the screen that seem to have been added for no (good) reason.The game renders wonderfully in ultrawide, just literally with black bars pasted over the top.

Negative,"The game look interesting, I ultimately got a refund because the controls for pc are garbage.",0
Negative,"No 21:9 support, constant frame rate issues and the worst screen tearing I have experienced in years. A superb disappointment of a console game ported to the PC as an afterthought. Doesn't matter how good your content is if it looks and plays like garbage.I love you, FROMSOFTWARE, but you broke my heart on this one.",0
Negative,"Sadly there is not a MEH option for steam reviews. ""But you have 263 hours"" Yeah, because I explored most of the content and afked when the game started to get stale.On release the game was incredibly laggy and previous from software games did not resolve issues in a timely manner so this was a negative review and I refunded the game. This time they patched the game in about 5 days so kudos.I like that they added more respawn points especially outside of boss rooms which prevents the player wasting time wading through enemies again to try again. This allowed me to take more risks and enjoy the game. Also they added a map finally. However, there isn't a quest log so that sucks. Most quests are nonsense and require backtracking that you only know about if you follow a guide. However, the long you play the game and explore it like an open world game the more you begin to hate it. I played as an astrologer which was advertise as a mage but it's not. It just a knight who happens to cast magic. A mage is powerful due to the utility spells that allow them to setup a situation for big damage. This game does not have those spells and all you have are DPS spells. Most of which are too slow or inaccurate to reliably use because you can only switch spells are save points. Most spells have rely upon the utterly garbage targetting system, have terrible tracking, and are too slow even with max spell casting speed. On top of that enemies read your spell input and instantly dodge which wouldn't be an issue but you're not allow to roll cancel your spells. So a missed spell costs a mana, stamina, mobilty, and probably hp. Which means you use the fastest spells like pebble or the night spells which prevents input reading on most mobs and some bosses. Can I use the carian sword spell sure, but at that point I'm just playing as a knight who happens to cast magic.There are really strong spells like Comet Azur but usually you need 1) a large enemy, 2) they have to stand still, 3) unlimited mana to deal decent damage, 4) a distraction. There are ""large"" openings but the AI has a habit of attacking even if they whiff or slam their weapon into the ground. The distraction can be a summon which works quite will until you go to the mountain tops and they have a lot more hp.Spell management is not great. I thought Baldurs Gate had bad management but this game takes the cake. You cant bind shortcuts to any spell. Just press up on the D-pad and it cycles only in one direction. So the more spells you slot the longer it takes to rotate through them even if you order them by the most frequently used.Spell progression peaks very early in the game because most spells are too slow, dont deal enough damage for the mp spent, and have back tracking. The most reliable spells are found early on, the glintstone pebble, and rock throw. Few spells compare with the speed and accuracy of these two. Another good one are the loretta bow spell but they have a very long cast time. Carin slicer is spammed often as well. With these 4 spells or so most spells that come after then are not upgrades or are situation specific. But because we can only change spells at graces the situation usually occurs without the spell slotted.To make matters even worse; The ashes of war that scale with INT cast faster, deal more damage, and cost less fp than most of the spells you have.As others have mentioned, they copy and pasted most of the side content and bosses spam fast attacks with aoes. There is more to say but I'll write it later I hope.",0
Negative,"First of all, I finished Sekiro 100%, DS2 twice and DS3. Just to get the"" git gud"" or ""this game is not for you"" arguments out of the way. There are two things that give structure to a game: a well thought-out difficulty curve and/or a story. This game has no difficulty curve because of the open world format and no story because of the misconception that lore = story. It isn't. Story means what's happening. Lore is the context, the background. While playing games I usually ask myself these questions to test the game's structure: what am I doing and why? where am I and why am I here ? etc. While playing this game I can never answer neither. This is not news tho. Souls like are always intentionally vague but at least they were somewhat held together by some cohesive level design. This is absent because of the open world format. So without any structure to speak of, this game feels like a bucket of content splattered on a huge map. Although it sometimes felt like a technical achievement in some ways, I can't help the fact that I did seldom had fun. There are some good ideas but overall this is nothing but a few steps backwards.",0
Negative,"Lots of optimization issues, and PC players are STILL dealing with invisible enemies and the mount being invisible. Hard to judge it on any other merits when I can't really play the game.

Negative,Amazing game in almost every front except for the optimization/performance is god awful. I would wait on a patch if you're on the fence on getting this game.,0
Negative,"Game has very low replay-ability to me compared to the previous souls games. PvP which is what I enjoyed most in the previous games is also still currently incredibly broken. I'm holding hope for future updates, but not worth it in it's current state, overall disappointed.",0
Negative,"The first third of the game is fun. You're learning the mechanics, exploring the world, and fighting against interesting mobs and bosses.The second third of the game is starting to lose some luster. There's a lot of repeated mobs and designs, you realize the quest system (if you can even call it that) is terrible, the open world is feeling dull, and the bosses are getting more on the annoying side of Souls games.The final third of the game is pure trash. You get to a point where your only option is to go find side content or grind to stand a chance against the bosses. Boss mechanics are agonizing, long, and boring chains of attacks with a small window for you to attack in response and multiple phases makes it very hard to learn their patterns. The classic terrible design of putting 2 enemies as a boss returns. I'm at one of the final 3 bosses in the game around level 100 and realize that I'm not having fun trying to learn the boss. There are so many cheap attacks, delayed attacks, and hits which chunk half of my health at 60 vigor that it's not even fun. Death happens way too fast and it's too easy to essentially get stun locked. I realized the only way I can win is to go grind more levels or use some broken build, neither of which I'm interested in doing.So if your idea of ""fun"" in a souls game is grinding a ton of levels or doing everything to stand a chance near the end you'll probably like this. If you want to progress through the game, not grind, and not have to do everything while enjoying souls combat then the last third of the game will ruin any enjoyment you experienced in the first half. It leaves an extremely sour taste in your mouth and is mediocre in comparison to previous Souls games.",0
Negative,"Playing on a clean system with a Ryzen 5 3600, 32 GB DDR4 and an RTX 3070 FE. Can't recommend yet due to massive performance issues (low fps and frequent stuttering). Other than that the game is fantastic. Just wait for the performance issues to be fixed.",0
Negative,"First zones are amazing. Later game is just barely acceptable for a ""souls"" game. I finished the game with most achievements (80%), so I did almost everything this game has to offer on a first run. I also played DS1, DS2, DS3 and bloodborne so I know the style of game.TLDR: A game with bloodborne enemies with Dark Souls movements for the players. Also fantastic early game exploration, lack luster for late game.Late game is empty, zones are nothing compared to the beginning of the game. Enemies are just made harder for the sake of saying they are harder. You've got the same recycled mob with one or two additional move set but now they will literally one shot you if you are below 35 vigorPoise late game (havent tried early) means nothing to the player. Almost all hits make you stumble, regardless of the armor set you have. Having the best armor set and defense in the game, you will still stumble to some trash mob.PvP is just absolute garbage. You also have to deal with 1v3 99% of the time. Every time I've invaded, I was ganked by 3 players. I got lucky sometimes and killed the host, but it was just that, pure luck. The most common weapon in PvP is the moonveil followed by the rivers of blood because they are absolutely broken (honor mention: the end-game boss weapon, which covers a ridiculous area and will one shot most players). They would be easy to handle if they were 1v1, but in a case of 1v2, 1v3 they are impossible to avoid for a prolonged period of time. On top of that, there is an item that will summon blue boys to help the 1v2-3. Late game, to survive the one shot meta, you need around 50 vigor.Most bosses are not well designed, stat and move wise. Some of the bosses have little to no rest in between combos, leaving almost no gap for punishing moves. This is not even mentioning their attacks that will one shot you. Some bosses require you to re-spec your character to beat them. Of all the bosses in the game, 3-4 of them are note worthy of being fun because learning their attack and move set feels rewarding. Malekith is a good example of what all game bosses should've been.There is no way to boost the horse at all. There are some points in the game where you have to use your horse for certain enemies/locations but your horse does not scale with your level. Your horse will get instantly killed by a single hit (even an AOE) and leave you on the ground to be promptly killed off.The AOE attacks of some enemies are absolutely ridiculous and feel like lazy game design rather than a thoughtful implementation. I can think of 2 enemies in the entire games that had proper AOE damage mechanics that didn't feel like bs. The end boss is nothing but short of disappointing. Chasing a giant bag of health that will spam ranged attack and teleport as soon as you get close is not fun. Oh, and while the arena is probably the biggest boss fighting zone, you have no horse. Have fun wasting all your stamina chasing after the boss so that it can teleport away and spam you again. Don't play this unless you are determined to finish it because its a souls game. Lots of frustration because of bad game designs.",0

Negative,"They clearly didn't even test this game with the anti cheat because regardless of what gpu you have (I have a 3060 and 2600 cpu) the game will stutter a lot, to the point where you are paused for a half/full second.

Most are a minor annoyance and happen quickly but some bring the game to a near stop and then speed the game up to where it's supposed to be.

Negative,literally randomly can't play anymore after a 100 hours of game play. just non-stop freezing and consistent lagging.,0
Negative,Not good. Severely disappointed. (read my dlc review),0
Negative,"Don't bother. You could play Dark Souls 3, have basically the same experience (even graphically, Elden Ring doesn't look any better to my eyes), and be done in maybe half the time. Perhaps even a better experience, since most of the bosses in Dark Souls 3 don't move around like they're marionettes being hoisted around by vexatious puppeteers, and they don't all have insipid area-of-effect attacks that seem bred of the developers' insecurity that their game isn't ""hard enough.""I will concede that recommending an older game means you'll miss out on some key parts of the Elden Ring experience. You won't see every surface covered in uninspired copycat graffiti. All that talk of pickles, fort nights, fingers but holes, you'll see none of that to distract you from being immersed in what is obviously supposed to be an immersive dark fantasy experience. You'll miss out on being killed by all those area-of-effect attacks, smacked in the face by all the enemies posed behind blind corners, and fighting the same bosses multiple times because the game is too long and the devs resorted to recycling assets. You won't have to make your poor melee-build character chase the final boss for a quarter mile through its featureless arena while trying to bring its ghostly laser-spewing form to battle. Most importantly though, you'll miss out on all those different poison swamps. There's a red one (visceral!) and one with a roof over it (cozy!) and one has a castle in the middle (fortified!)If you are not deterred, and I doubt my sarcastic ranting has done much to sway you, at least buy Elden Ring on sale rather than full price. Devs shouldn't be rewarded financially or critically for rehashing the same tired ideas over and over.",0

Negative,"DISCLAIMER: This review is temporary and will be removed once the issue(s) involved are addressed in full by the developer.I really didn't want to write this review, but the terrible performance on PC justifies it in order to warn others away from this game until the performance issues are addressed by the developer. This game has massive stuttering and fps issues on PC. It doesn't matter if you have the best hardware on the market or not as it WILL happen to you. I've been digging into sources explaining the issue in full ranging from Digital Foundry and others and the root cause appears to be the half-baked implementation of DX12. Unfortunately, it appears there is no way to launch the game in DX11 so we're all stuck at the mercy of the Stutter Ring until fixed. As far as gameplay goes this game is fantastic. This would be a 10/10 positive review so far if the game actually worked properly. Please fix it sooner rather than later FromSoft.",0
Negative,"If you like Dark Souls, get this game. If you don't, it's not going to be all that different just because it's an open world. There's a lot of grinding and dying. If you're not into hard fighting games, give it a miss.Edit: one of my main complaints is that it's very bad at explaining the game's systems to you, including stuff that will make your experience vastly better. Talking through your early game with friends is an ok fix, but I haven't found any great guides. Most of the ones that do exist just tell you what gear and spells you should get, which if you're in the first few hours are usually unreachable or extremely frustrating to get.For example, I realized about 10 hours in that my starting gear gave me the status ""heavy load"", which makes you move and dodge much slower and thus makes lots of boss fights way harder. No guides mentioned this. Nor did they mention that rather than leveling up your stats, the best use for early runes is upgrading your weapons (you also need smithing stones, but you can Google where to find them and eventually buy them). Both of these are crucial pieces of info - I'd say they made my character ~60% better combined - but nobody mentions them. If you can find a better guide than 90% of the ones you'll see on the Internet, or have friends who are willing to explain things to you, the game gets a lot better.",0

When FromSoft finally fixes the issues with performance I and many others have been having, this game will been one of the best I've played.",0
Negative,"I'm very sorry but I can't recommend this game in it's current state. And it makes me really sad. The game is 15/10 in every way, but man does it run poorly. It constantly freezes for like 3 seconds, jumping from 60 fps to 5 fps and then 30 and so on. I have a pretty heavy rig: Ryzen 9 3950X, 32 gb ram, RTX 3090, and I've tried lowering down graphics and resolution and nothing seems to work.It does not deserve Mostly positive reviews as it is.DO NOT BUY until is fixed.",0
Negative,Awful new-wave open world Dark Souls remake pretty much. Combat is nowhere near as satisfying and just seems like an open world to keep non-hardcore players happy. If you think Dark Souls was time consuming think again this wastes so much time for literally no reason. Clearly made for the majority of casual players who probably played less than 2 hours of Dark Souls because it was 'too difficult' and would rather run around an open world with that time.Overall feels like a kids version of Dark Souls.Massively disappointed.,0
Negative,"Now that I've caught your attention, hopefully, I can say a few things about this game. Most of the things I have to say are positive, but there's a HUGE problem with the game that is the sole reason why I leave this game not recommended. Since it's so important, I'll say it right away.There is an ungodly amount of input lag on the PC port. I don't know what it is with From Soft games and their engine's input system, but From Soft games are pretty much the only games I have that I have major input lag issues with. Input system is one of the core features of any game. If they work, you won't pay any attention to them, but if they don't, OH BOY!It doesn't help that Elden Ring, like the previous Souls games, has an action queue. Action queue is where inputs from player are put in a queue that get executed one after another. So if you press your roll button while you are hitting, you will immediately do a roll once the attack animation finishes, and vice versa. This leads to you getting cheap hits even if your dodge reaction and input is on point. Because of input lag, you get hit. Once you recover from the hit you do a roll immediately despite not pressing the roll button again. If the enemy has a follow up attack, you will get hit a second time. Depending on the damage, this can result in your death immediately.On average my input lag is about 230 ms. This isn't much, but it's noticeable. At worst it has been 700 ms. At this point the game is literally unplayable. Input lag seems to grow the longer sessions I have, which is why I've had to keep my Elden Ring sessions rather short. Usually around 2 hours.Until From Soft fixes this core issue, I cannot recommend the game to anyone on PC. If it does get fixed, I'll switch my recommendation to yes.The game, in overall, is gorgeous. If you have played through the Dark Souls series, and Sekiro, and Bloodborne the visuals are just as stunning. Occasionally even awestriking. The game runs buttery smooth, allowing to keep track of things on the screen, which is important for the combat of this game. It makes animations fluid and natural. I've never stopped in the game to wonder what just happened because of this. Moreover, I've seen animations that simply make me go like ""Wow. Now that's a cool move!"" So visuals and animations are great. Only problem with them has been hitboxes. Generally From Soft's games have beautifully tight hitboxes where you can dodge an enemy attack that would normally hit by doing a move that ducks your head down a little bit or jump at the right time. Granted the jumping in Elden Ring follows suit from Sekiro that had attacks which could only be dodged by jumping over. However, in Elden Ring I've had cases where an enemy attack hits me as they hit in front of them despite me being behind them, although this seldom happens. Nowhere near as bad as Dark Souls 2, so I'll give it a pass.Not much I will say about audio. The soundtrack is great, as always, and once you learn, the sounds of enemies can cue you on their whereabouts and their intentions.Elden Ring introduced something never-seen-before in From Soft games. An open world. It has been one of the biggest selling points for it. Despite making the game open world, From Soft included areas that work closer to the original Souls formula of linear and interconnected level design. You can pretty easily tell these areas apart, for you are provided with the mount that can be summoned whenever you wish with no cost to you but only in the open fields. You cannot summon your mount in these linearly structured layouts. These are where you mostly will find secrets as well behind illusory walls. They incorporate shortcuts that connect the areas together inside this little linear sandbox, just like in the original Dark Souls level design formula.As with many other open world games, Elden Ring features a crafting system. Some of the required ingredients can be found in the linear levels, but majority is found outside in the open world. Of course, you can pick them on horseback, thankfully. The pickable items are given a faint glow. Valuable items usually have a bright white flame on them, making them very discernible from the ground. The exploration is made a little bit easier as you can warp immediately between Graces (the equivalent of bonfires from the Souls series.) Probably the only game where it's an immediately welcome feature due to the size of the overworld, not to mention it would make the tracking of NPCs and merchants too difficult.If you have played other Souls games, then there isn't much difference to Dark Souls 3. Only differences are that poise has been reworked better, some systems from Sekiro, like stance breaking and jump dodging; a few new status ailments, one of which works similarly to Bloodborne's Frenzy; summons (that's right. You can summon in this game.), guard countering with shields and, of course, power stancing from Dark Souls 2. Open world sectors feature horseback battle. You can use pretty much any weapon on horseback, even magic and throwable items. Against some enemies horseback fighting is even recommended, and can give you an edge against grounded or airborne enemies. You can even heal your horse as he can take damage instead of you. As of yet, I have not fought all of the bosses, but majority have been a fun and engaging fight, sometimes frustrating, because you die to them like 20 times. But after overcoming a foe or situation you have been having trouble with the whole day, you feel accomplished.",0
Negative,"Much like how, given enough time, a chimpanzee with a typewriter will inevitably re-create Shakespeare, the FromSoft devs are at that halfway point; they ve *almost* created a masterpiece, but there s still too much monkey poop and banana peels mucking it all up.Halo: Combat Evolved launched in 2001 and, to this day, stands as an absolute marvel of enemy AI; that s 23 years of pure ignorance that FromSoft has maintained.Why hire a group of talented developers when you can just use this handy spreadsheet:Inflate enemy damageInflate enemy HPInflate enemy hitboxesInflate amount of attacks per comboInflate amount of enemiesInflate enemy ranged optionsAdd AOEAdd lingering effectsAdd arena-sized evasion moves that forces the player to constantly chase the enemy in question.Or, in Elden Ring s case, why not all of these options at the exact same time?!Did the cameraman take his Parkinson s medication? No? Wonderful!

Negative,"My first soulsborne and honestly it's just not that good. It's very JRPG in a way I didn't anticipate, and ultimately it's only difficult because the control mechanics aren't good. Every boss can be defeated by just rolling around frantically and spamming attack keys and then rolling away frantically, and the only reason you die endlessly is because those mechanics aren't implemented well so sometimes you roll in directions you didn't intend to, etc. They even restrict the number of key binds you can assign so that it's needlessly restrictive in controls, to help facilitate this gameplay. The world is cool and it has a cool atmosphere, but it's really just a game where you run around until you find a boss hiding somewhere, die a hundred times even though you know what you're supposed to do to beat it because the controls kind of suck, and then you finally beat it after wasting a lot of time and then you rinse and repeat. I expected more of a Shadows of the Colossus type level of puzzle solving but so far it seems like there isn't any of that, and that's the vibe I got from looking at boss combat guides online as well. It's just timing rolls in and out of strike areas for every fight. If this is what people consider ""best game of the year"" and ""best game of all time"" then it really is a testament to how bad games have become. The ""story isn't handed to you"" and ""everything isn't on the map immediately"" is a nice throwback to ya know. Morrowind or something, and I love that, but also. it's not anything new or groundbreaking - in fact it's dated. Disappointing, wastes a lot of time, and ultimately not even that fulfilling when you finally beat ""difficult"" opponents, because usually it's something you knew you could have done 20 deaths ago if it wasn't made to be pointlessly difficult for the illusion of complexity. I saw right through that in the first hour or two and once the illusion is ruined you're just left with it being a frustrating time sink.TL;DR: It's like if a sexually frustrated nineteen year old boy who wears a fedora, is really into JoJo memes, and whose only personality trait is people not having liked him in high school were a game. It's not as complicated as it pretends to be, it's needlessly obtuse, and it uses pointless repetitive action to self-stimulate.",0
Negative,"TL;DR = This game is trash on many levels. It's a Garry's Mod version of a Dark Souls game that had good concepts but really bad execution.- The character creation sucks- Character/enemy models and attack animations are ripped directly from previous games with slight reskins.- Loot is garbage unless you are a magic or quality build.- Lots of pop-in and draw distance level of detail is pitiful. It feels like I'm playing a video game version of a Bob Ross painting.- No incentive to fight trash mobs because you can just go around them.- Jump attacks and mounted combat are clunky. I will say mounted combat does work against some bosses.- The ""open"" world isn't open at all. It's a larger world, but you can't just go anywhere and do anything. You must complete zones in a certain order and some areas are locked until bosses are beaten.- Stealth attacks are pointless since nearby enemies will be alerted to your presence anyway.- Strength and Faith builds lack both weapon and spell variety.- You have to pump Vigor to at least 50 otherwise you get destroyed by most things in the game.- Crafting items is an unnecessary extra step and the items themselves are mostly useless.- Lazy artificial difficulty via large groups of the same enemies or multiple of the same boss.- Enemy variety is lackluster and not unique to the 5 regions.- Very little incentive to explore since most places of interest have little to no rewards of value.- Poise is completely broken, you will be interrupted during heavy attacks by anything and everything.- Enemies can hit you while you are downed.- All bosses have a cheap AoE ground smash attack that hits you 9/10 times.- Late game bosses have ridiculously long combo attacks that are nearly impossible to dodge.- Ashes of War are mostly crap- Summoning Ashes are also mostly crap- Power stance only gives you a single unique attack animation that is the same for most weapon classes.- The map is not nearly as helpful at finding paths to new areas as it should be.- So many sidequests will be missed because there is no way to track NPCs. A sidequest log is mandatory for a game this size.- And lastly, the boss encounters are completely lacking in mechanics or strategy. It's basically hit, dodge 25 times, hit for the entirety of the game.",0
Negative,"TLDR: I give this game a 4/10. Good for one completion, don't try PvP, gl with the bugs/technical problems.If you wish to read the ramblings of a mad Hollow, seek below:I've put about 160 hours into this crap heap. Initially, I was very pleased. I thought ""Y'know this Dark Souls 4 is pretty great. I can't wait to continue playing with my friends and exploring what all it has to offer.""It was too good to be true.Somehow, I have managed to stumble into every single stupid fucking bug this game has to offer. You name it. Falling through the map, my items spawning in mid-air becoming unreachable, important npcs shunning me, graces being unable to be touched, falling to my death infinitely after walking off of a 1ft ledge against a rock, getting stuck on a lower cliff ledge, dying of a spontaneous heart attack, the horse EXPLODING under me as I ride it, bosses falling off the arena and dying instantly, bosses getting stuck on terrain or ignoring me as I wail on them, the FINAL BOSS glitching and holding still in BOTH forms against me. Everything. I am sick and tired of it. There is no damn excuse to let this game go like this. For example, you remember that trick from previous games where you could invade in with your floating magic heat-seeking death orbs invisible? Guess what. Still exists this many years later with the Carian Retaliation. Absolutely absurd. People aren't hesitating to exploit this game in the slightest, and it has made online play impossible to enjoy.If I am to be so kind as to look PAST all that monstrous technical difficulty, I then have to get past the crashes and frame dips. I know everyone is having this problem, my friend and I run behemoth rigs and we still experience this crap. It is definitely a valid complaint. When THAT isn't happening, it's always something else. For every good thing that happens in Elden Ring, a worse thing just spawns its way into my face. Heaven forbid I want to play with any friends. I either get to sit there and watch myself constantly disconnect or randomly disconnect regardless of who summons whom, or just flat out get soft-locked from being summoned anymore because we decided to kill a few too many random bosses (for people thinking this is Soul Level related, no, we strictly kept our levels and weapons tightly together). Why they decided to keep the absurd linear lock-out mechanic in this OPEN WORLD GAME, is beyond me. From likes bullshit, be it lore, mechanics, or scaling.SPEAKING of scaling. PvP is a god damn absolute nightmare, and the worst it has ever been in a Fromsoft game period. Wanna invade people? Good luck buddy, the new standard is 1v2, take more than 1 minute and it'll become 1v3. But hey it's okay! Everyone does insane damage now to compensate for it! The most anyone has ever done as matter of fact! Not even level 50 Vigor and some bonus talismans are gonna save you, as the meta of Elden Ring entirely revolves around Bloodhound, Blood Loss, Madness, or one-shot exploits. You WILL die instantly as soon as they hit you or stunlock you, and you will experience that tenfold over with every invasion. Tough shit, I guess. Don't even get me STARTED on the AFK epidemic that From seems to be doing NOTHING about. I've resorted to invading purely in attempt to kill them with the Jar Cannon before some idiotic blood hungry monkeys come hunting in and murder me instantly, perpetuating this problem. Dark Souls does not generally make me angry after failing to it, as I entirely love the way they handle, but this is a first for making me Alt-F4 after invading and dying 7 times in a row to a chain-stun Madness bolt casted by 3 people or a man with infinite poise sprinting up and grabbing me for an attempted insta-kill due to a bugged spell, just for him to miss and then 1-shot bleed loss me.But fine, if I wanna review it past ALL of this horseshite, fine. It's a very pretty game, I'll say that. From did a wonderful job at building the scenery and world with all its swelling music as per standard. They deserve credit on that front. The story I didn't care too much for, but its fine since I was a fan of the character designs (not their names, GOOD LUCK trying to memorize everyone since they start with M's and R's and sound alike. Grade A writing there George) and how they used attacks, such as Starscourge's ability to Valstrax my ass. I'm glad it isn't a continuation of Dark Souls since I believe Dark Souls 3 had a wonderful conclusion to its grim narrative. And oh baby, that boss before the final boss? I didn't even know he existed, but that was without a doubt my favorite fight. Would get my ass kicked again 10/10 from him.The weapon choice is fantastic. They've got rid of the stones to infuse status/type into your weapons. Weapon Arts too can now be found in the world by themselves and reapplied to any weapon you want (that isn't a somber stone wep) to make creative builds. You can murder a dragon with fucking bubbles in this game. If that doesn't spell amazing I don't know what does. Elden Ring gives you plenty of opportunity to pick up anything you'd like. But, that being said, that doesn't mean everything is obviously viable. There is a meta for a reason, and that is due to the whack scaling From has armed the player with. Take what you will with caution if you ever choose to try and play against a weakness, because it turns out smashing your blood soaked head into a wall may actually end up doing more damage. I have no complaints either with any enemy type I found aside from. flying enemies. I will never approve of little shit flying mobs zipping around you out of arms reach bum rushing you after chasing you from one side of a castle to another not giving you a chance to heal.With the enemies and beating the game being mentioned, I am especially saddened to see that this game does not feature anything new for NG+. Previous titles always tended to throw in some bonuses, be them new enemies or etc, in your face once you had beaten the game. But Elden Ring. despite ALL of the map space and opportunity, has nothing different aside from making the same mobs stronger and give more runes. What a horribly missed opportunity. I'll also say. WHERE THE HELL ARE THE MIMIC CHESTS?!? And no don't give me that ""tHeRe aRe mImIcS tHeY tRaP yOu iN sMoKe aNd tElEPoRt YoU!1"". That is stupid and you know it too. That is a low rate stage magician grade trap at best, and it can NEVER compared to a chest standing up and round-housing my ass across the room. Ya'll remembered the invisible walls but not the damn mimics? Come the hell on. I'm not even gonna elaborate on how some hidden walls have invisible health bars and need to be smacked a shit ton to reveal. Not sure whether that is to be grouped in with the huge bug list or huge From BS list. Ultimately, I beat it. I did my best to collect everything I could, when I got tired of trying to comprehend vague gibberish as bad as Castlevania 2: Simon's Quest I googled what I missed, even messed around with some farming with the Gold Giga Sword so that I could aid my friends in their boss fights. Would I beat it again? Absolutely not. I got my fill from it. I played these 160 hours to crawl into every obscure cave I could, collect all my incantations and spells, play some Fashion Souls and cosplay with the boys (though everyone online right now PvPing could give less a shit as they rush at you with monkey screams), kill the bosses and finish the quests. I love Dark Souls as a series, truly. But I cannot recommend this game in this state, as of 4/13/22. It is just too damn riddled with issues and poor design choices that keep it from being a masterpiece. Maybe someday they'll fix it, and I'll probably return for the inevitable DLC where the final boss wields 4 Rivers of Blood and Bloodhound steps towards you with a Madness AoE aura. I'll fight it just the same, and I'll complain just the same. The shit we do for love.Good luck, Tarnished.",0

Negative,"One of the best games ever made. So why the negative review? Because fromsoft still seems to not understand what pc players want. This port runs well enough, however is clearly not meant for pc. In my opinion a large part of what makes pc gaming great is the freedom it offers players, and this game lacks a good list of said freedoms. First off, being locked at 60fps in 2024 is just pathetic, even for a console game. On top of that, ultrawide support and dlss/fsr support would be mutch appreciated. There are fixes for these which are super easiy to impliment but involve needing to play offline mode and jump through hoops in order to not get banned. My only compaint about the game itself is how fromsoft also seems to hate the idea of us playing games with friends. It has gotten better as the souls games have progressed, but it is clear they dont want us playing these games cooperatively. Additionally, I understand if it's a game element, but it is beyond annoying wanting to play the game with a friend only to 100% guarantee be invaded after 3 minutes of playing together by someone. Ideally I would like to see future souls games have a larger focus on freedom of play, as I don't see why they should decide how I best want to play the game. Wish they understood that a large portion of their fanbase is pc, and hope the future holds more support for the pc platform itself.",0
Negative,"The game itself is decent, until you get about halfway into the game. Enemies and bosses at that point begin to spam Aoe effects and are able to turn 300 degrees mid swing.Edit: After compleating the game can I also add: The game is padded to all hell. You will be riding for hours in mostly empty landscapes after the capital city halfway trough the game. Repeated bosses litter later areas and they all can kill you with three taps. A shame really, but the game looks good and plays rather well. If you are the patient sort that don't mind waiting while the boss goes all anime on your ass then go ahead.",0

Negative,"If you've never played a souls game before, then I'd says it's pretty unlikely for you to enjoy this game. I decided I would give it a try and play my first souls game, but the game is too hard for me, the cycle of dying over and over again against crazy opponents, personally, is just depressing.",0
Negative,"I desperately, desperately, desperately wanted to love this game, I really did. After over 300 hours in DS3 I was looking forward to basically the same game but with more content. What would not be to love about that? Riight?60 hours in I really need to write this review. The first couple hours were fun and great but then my gripes started showing more and more.First off: The game is way, way, way too big. The world feels empty and not very meaningful more often than not and it's just there to be there and tedious and time consuming to navigate (thanks for unlimited teleports from everyhwere on the map tho). But navigation isn't why you play a FromSoft game, is it? It's the Bosses and enemy encounters that let you sweat and leave you with a feeling of accomplishment, that you outsmarted the demi gods!And here is where my second, waaaaay bigger problem rears it's ugly head. Boss design (and enemies in general):AOE is the name of the game, nearly every boss has (mostly not very well teleprahped) AOE attacks that sometimes fill the whole arena, attacks that stagger you without any means to recover and generally damage that one or two shots you without massive investment in Vig. Getting AOE staggered and killed by a super fast follow-up maybe gets a sly smile and a ""You got me there Miyazaki-san!"" out of the the first time it happens, but after the 50th time you just roll your eyes and are fed up with that. And I know, i could play this game as a caster and would have a breeze, but not interacting with the boss does not feel like you should experience the game.Speaking of Interaction with the game world and stagger sthat lead to quick deaths: That's one of my bigger problems with overworld enemies as well. so many just gang you up, staggerlock and kill you that interacting with them is not rewarding and i found myself just riding by, grabbing the odd item and just f**** off without fighting. It's a big, unbalanced mess (for melee builds at least) and I'm just very disappointed.After finishing the game the afremoentioned points still stand. Plus a ridiculous damage spike near the end and the last bosses left me. empty, no exhilaration after beating them. Just ""finally its over"" And I do not like that.",0
Negative,"Most of the game past the first two areas, and especially past the Capitol, is rehashed, copy-pasted content with almost nothing unique.Beyond this, encounter design is practically nonexistent. Enemies are usually just plopped down in masses with very little thought, or it's some kind of trap. Boss design is utterly horrendous. This isn't an issue of being too difficult. Rather, the bosses reach an extreme level of imbalance. Most bosses I fought died without really threatening me at all; some of them I killed through stunlocking, or doing so much damage that they weren't able to get a hit in, despite being level-appropriate and having challenging mobs leading up to them.On the other end of the spectrum, bosses seem designed to be frustrating and to punish veterans of the game. This isn't really a flaw by itself, as veterans need to be challenged lest they lose the satisfaction of overcoming adversity which is so central to these games. Rather, the problem is the complete lack of rhythm to these fights. To fuck up those experienced with their games, Fromsoft made every boss feint their attacks, or have randomly-timed counterattacks. The end result are boss fights which lack any smoothness or flow, relying pretty much entirely on reaction. The most fun part of combat - the aggression and the punish - is minimized in favor of almost endless kiting and dodging for perhaps one or two R1s. Adding onto this, the damage of many bosses is overtuned to the point where high-vigor, high-armor characters can get almost oneshot by most attacks. Even with these bosses, however, I found little meaningful challenge. This isn't to play up my own ability. I'm sure that, had I opted out of magic and spirit ashes, these bosses would have made me want to kill myself, but instead most were dispatched with very little of my own input. Spirit ashes are incredibly overpowered in combination with magic, and the fact that these fights were apparently designed with ashes in mind is baffling. It's simply not rewarding.I think Elden Ring could have been a fantastic game given another three years of development and a more refined, less corrupted philosophy on encounter and boss design. The level design of some dungeons is very enjoyable. As it stands, the game feels emasculated as you reach the end of the game. One sees almost everything there is to offer by the time they finish Limgrave and Liurnia, and I'm guessing this is why so many games journalists sang the praises for this game, since most don't get an opportunity to finish the games they review. The level of rehashed assets goes above and beyond even DS1's lategame. And beyond that, the encounter and boss design feels incredibly uninspired, ill-balanced and untested.If you're a poor Brazillian or a fromsoft fan with the patience of a Buddha who hasn't jumped for this game yet, I would give it another several years for balance patches and DLC. And when you do play, I do not advise exploring the entire world past Liurnia. Maybe look up a guide or something and see what items you want, and just go for them. Otherwise you'll just get burnt out on the content like I did, because the level of recycled content is among the highest I've ever seen in an open world game.Also, don't mind the hours, I tried the game out before buying and copied my save over.",0
Negative,"This game is good, not great, but quite good. However, I've given up trying to play this game on keyboard & mouse.

Negative,Crashed and corrupted my save file after 40 hours of base game + DLC. It also corrupted the .bak file and the steam cloud save. I cannot recommend a game this poorly coded.,0
Negative,"UnplayableElden Ring is one of the best games ever and one of my favorite FromSoftware games. I expect more from them though. Ever since the DLC was released it has been unplayable. I have attempted to play the game 30 times. It hasn't booted correctly 20 times, froze and crashed 9 times, and has been fine once. This needs to get patched otherwise I'll never even make it to the DLC.",0
Negative,Don't get me wrong elden rings story and bosses are really cool or good/decent but currently elden rings performance and multiplayer changes from previous souls game have driven me from continuing the game I've decide to take a break and home in a months time this game will be updated and fixed on all aspects MULTIPLAYER has been fucked beyond belief especially if you and A friend are traversing the entire world together the changes making invasions only possible if there is at least 1 summon was beyond ignorant majority of the souls community have always hated ganking and now are forced to be ganked in order to invade while also being pushed to not invade at all due to the fact that the cons out way the rewards. Killing any summons including blue invaders who have come to help the host offer nothing but runes and not even a decent amount you will only be rewarded a rune for killing the host which will be protected by every summon even if they're using a glitch build that instantly kills you. invading forces you to deal with ganking and gives you nothing for dealing with 3 plus people majority of the time Not to mention the fact that limiting invasions to a small portion of people means if you and a friend are playing together and trying to kill a world boss you're nearly instantly invaded and now have to fight a boss and invader the boss can damage the invader but will never target him. This makes invasion very limited to a small sub section of people who play with summons and offer no rewards while also making it so if you choose to play with a friend extremely frustrating due to the limited ammout of people who can be invaded you're very likely to get invaded and have someone use a glitch or cheese build while running to a boss when they're losing the fight or instant death for you.OPINION ON THIS GAME AS A WHOLE : I genuinely loved playing this game for the first 10 hours and almost all of the new changes are amazing but honestly with the giant middle finger from has given to its fan base by decimating invasions and making them more frustrating and just all in all not worth the effort due to the garbage rewards if I could I'd refund this game and wait until it was either updated and fixed or just not buy it but I can't. I implore all of you who are fromsoft fanboys like me to watch a bunch of gameplay and invasions and read about the multiplayer changes before wasting your money on a game you'll end up hating a few hours in. Thanks for reading have a nice dayTLDR: Fromsoft fucked multiplayer and made realize I shouldn't have bought this game because a lot of bosses are just boring and the same as the last except for design wise and brought me to the point that I'll never buy another fromsoft game again before seeing A lot of gameplay and multiplayer while also doing a bunch of research on it.,0
Negative,"I wanna do a proper review thats stupid long when i beat the final boss and do a ranking and description of all of them because i love sharting out words onto screens but for now i am taking a break because i dont like the elden ring trend of youtube tutorial bosses. Malenia was forgiveable to me, only because her fight was incredible in almost every other way (parry only is the best way to appreciate the fight) except for waterfowl dance of course, all it took for the very few incredibly designed bosses in that game was 1 either stupid mechanic or attack that changes the fight completely for the worse, usually to counter or deal with them its almost required for me to break my no walkthrough or youtube video guide with the exception of weird confusing souls gimmick bosses, its very unsatisfying and promised consort radahn is probably the most egregious of this boss archetype which is sad gibven hes the final boss.his multi hit repeating attacks are by far the most stupid looking attack ever created in the series and thats rich coming from a game chock full with mostly unnatural difficulty inflating delay attacks. This game should never call itself an rpg if you are essentially unable to consistently dodge these multi hits without a tutorial AND light load + talisman that increases i frames even more at the cost of phys defense reduction. It feels fine for me because thats what i run with the parry only build, but other players should not be forced to any style of play EVER especially into a hyper specific one like i mentioned. Comparing him to other final souls bosses is like the fromsoft version of comparing fatalis (mhw) to literally any zenith monster, hell even zenith khezu. Im sorry for shoehorning in more monster hunter frontier comparisons but given that elden ring seems to be going in the direction of hardcore power creeping a long decently balanced series is very reminiscent of the subjective issues with frontier, it scares me quite a bit. It makes me quite sad too, his first phase has been a joy to learn with parry only as it basically just becomes an excercise in insanely quick reactions based on his option select out of his recovery frames from a parry stun animation. I still dont like the design and arena, it feels flaccid as a final boss but atleast thank god 1/3 of the fight is very fun for one very specific playstyle, nioce design fromsoft. Thanks for listening to the corporation overlords genius public relations campaign of kai-cenat-rizz-souls-games-are-supposed-to-be-the-pinnacle-of difficulty-no-nuanced-disscusion-allowed-slave-knight-gael-and-sword-saint-isshin-are-badly-designed-because-they-are-difficult-but-not-cheap-with-attacks-designed-for-youtube-streamer-reaction-videos-to-THE-MOST-INSANE-UNDODGEABLE-IMPOSSIBLE-HARDEST-BOSS-IN-HISTORY-THIS-WILL-FARM-ENGAGEMENT-WITH-OUR-REALLY-HARD-CRAZY-COOL-JAPANESE-GAME.Its gonna be even longer. Just taking a break because i have a JOB 60 HOURS A WEEK ON THE COLD LINE and i dont feel like spending my couple of hours off steamrolling his 1st phase into parry loop oblivion just to get 2 shotted by an undead-redhead-turned-beautiful-blonde-retartd. There is so much more about this dlc i can rant about by extension, and i will absolutely. I dont even really hate this boss. Its just not the kind that motivates me to beat it, phase 1 was like that in a sense and i am grateful that atleast 3 or 4 other bosses midra especially, i never wouldve thought such a perfectly designed boss would be shat out at the end of the 6th and most empty lazy unrewarding and rushed area were able to rekindle that incredible boss adrenaline rush that can keep me up at night trying again and again until im mere hours away from 8oclock kitchen clock in. It was great, no other parts of this mediocre dlc and especially the final boss will have me feeling that, rant over, i am goojg to work again soon which sucks, this is going to be much longer. I love my life and writing, when my wacom tablet drivers are being biatches i use steam reviws as a stupid creative outlet because i just need something to do. Thanks",0
Negative,"cannot give a positive rating with how the connectivity of the game is absolutely garbage, fails to connect people 90 percent of the time, and when you do connect theres a strong chance you will disconnect, either randomly or halfway through a boss fight, thats a pretty big flaw, whoever rated this 10/10 is a moronenemies just decide to be invisible including your mount, this is a very common issuethis game is essentially dark souls 4, but with modified story that has a proper narrative and open world free roam, which is not a bad thing",0
Negative,"Spirit ashes ruined an otherwise great game. All bosses in the game have been balanced around spirit ashes tanking the boss for the player to get hits in. Leaves an empty feeling after beating a boss, if ashes are used. If spirit ashes are not used, welcome to unpunishable attack spam simulator. That's an exaggeration but holds true to most of late game boss attacks or should I say 5+ combos. Something that made previous Fromsoft titles sociably enjoyable was the shared experience of beating a boss. This hardly exists in Elden ring due to poor balance. Certain builds deal absurd amounts of damage and the use of spirit ashes can make the boss you fought and the same boss your friend fought be completely different and unrelatable.While the amount of different weapon customization in ER is amazing, it is overshadowed by the power disparity of broken weapons. I've summoned myself to help plenty of noobs on Melenia and other bosses. The amount of times I've seen the same overpowered weapons (rivers of blood, moonveil) tells me that, despite ER's amazing weapon variety, it is ignored in favor of big damage.Invasion timer is set to allow invaders every 15 minutes if the host has a summon. The timer does not pause once an invader is summoned so for anyone cooping through the area normally with their friend, welcome to invasion hell. Once that invader dies, a new one will show up shortly due to the timer never pausing. Imagine an invader sticking around for 14:59 minutes and then after killing him, a new one shows up. This poorly designed timer has led to most people looking to play the game normally to put their summon signs outside of boss gates to avoid the zombie hordes of pvp'ers. If you are looking to invade, because most normal coopers are gone, you will most likely run into gankers rather than people playing the game normally. There are other specific issues in pvp not mentioned.Older From games are more fine-tuned than this and are more enjoyable to coop. Elden ring feels like a jank fest and coop is neutered.",0
Negative,the worst fromsoft game/dlc. far worse than dark souls 2. beaten every boss in this game and every fromsoft game. this game is the polar opposite of dark souls. instead of 'going hollow' giving up against a wall of difficulty. these bosses make you lose hope and will AFTER you beat them because it was just the worst slog of your life. and all you feel after winning is despair and emptiness. even matches the ludonarrative lore of the game vs dark souls lmao.,0
Negative,"Fun with a co-op partner, horrible in PVP. Alot of unbalanced weapons/spells. Delayed hit city.",0
Negative,"visually stunning game with satisfying combat, however, the overall experience is underwhelming. the game feels empty with the lack of multiplayer interaction within the singleplayer world. there's a lot of aimless exploration with not a lot to do, or a drive of where to go. there's a lot of blatant reuse of the same bosses, items, and enemies over and over (many of which are broken or poorly designed).with the lack of invasions, the game has essentially become a PVE singleplayer/coop experience, which detracts from what made the Dark Souls series so enjoyable.all in all, Elden Ring fails to live up to its potential. it lacks the depth and richness of its predecessors, making it feel like a hollow shell of what it could have been. the visuals are stunning, but the experience is ultimately disappointing.",0
Negative,Puts every other open world game to shame.Also puts gaming industry standard slave driving work culture to shame.Your employees worked really fucking hard to make this game.Treat them right,0
Negative,"This one is harsh but i'm fucking done with these crappy launches of overhyped titles!The Negative :- It's struggling to maintain 60FPS @ 1440p on a 3080 - Massive stuttering and drops to the mid 20s- Game hangs outright for 2-4 seconds- Crashed 4 times within 6 hours of game time (2 Hours of fiddling with ""fixes"" included)- 60 FPS cap- No ultrawide support- Easy-Anti cheat will prevent any unofficial fixes or mods for this game, even when playing offline so u can forget that for now at least.Here is a Video from DF about the glaring issues ER has : The Positive:+ HDR seems to be working, even without having to tick it in Windows first.+ Sound and Artworks seem pretty good+ Massive open World and ContentI wont judge the gameplay for now since i fucking cant, in the state the game is currently in.This is unacceptable even for a From Software Game.",0
Negative,"2 Huge problems with this game.1. This is NOT a Co-op game as advertised! It has Co-op elements but it DOES NOT allow you to Co-op with a friend without being PvP invaded and 1 shot by almost EVERY invader, or the invaders hit detection is garbage and they teleport everywhere and you get stabbed in the back with a crit even though they were just in front of you! ""Oh but they are matched to your level"" I hear you say, but they have end game items, spells, ashes of war, ect. that YOU don't have access to till 40+ hours in the game, that makes it completely unfair. And yes me and my friend WERE 1 shotted by a dude with a dragon spell. That there is no way to prevent invasions is inexcusable! This is the single dumbest thing I have ever seen in a supposedly co-op game. Why not have a separate mode for pvp? Or not allow an invasion every 30 seconds? I just want to play with a friend and help him through the castle area and we can't. If I would have known the co-op was like this I would not have purchased this game. To me this is false advertising.2. This game should be renamed ""Google it"" or have a google search bar incorporated into the game. I know they didn't want the game to hold your hand but this is ridiculous! After 20 hours in I finally had an NPC put a mark on my map for where to go, and all that did was serve to piss me off more as I was pissed that no other NPC did this. All most of them do is say a vague direction and leave you to figure it out. Heaven forbid you have a bad memory because you WILL forget about them. There is no journal either, so after talking to an NPC there is no way to remember what they said about where to go. It seems more like the devs did this solely to pad the game, why in this huge of a game they would do this I'll never know.Other than these 2 horrible issues, the game is beautiful and if you like a huge single player experience than you may like this. The difficulty is not as bad as people make it out to be, it's mostly about pattern recognition. 7/10 for the single player experience2/10 for the co-op experience. I got a furled finger for your co-op. Wanna guess which one it is?",0
Negative,They really mean the recommended NVIDIA GEFORCE GTX 1070 8 GB or AMD RADEON RX VEGA 56 8 GB because the graphics on max settings still really looks like something that was released a couple years ago. Keyboard/mouse control is spotty at best in menus (sometimes the ESC key closes a menu . sometimes its the 'action key' and then ESC other times you really need to use a controller. All the on screen tutorial messages show commands just for a controller or describe an action but don't tell you how to do it. Defiantly get the vibe that KB/M was tacked on (if we must) mostly as an after thought.,0
Negative,"My down vote stands until they fix connection/server issues, random crashing, and frame stutter on PC version. Otherwise, we all know its a great game with lots of depth and stunning boss fights. Trouble is. I dislike single player games. Open world feels lonely to me without the ability to travel with friends and multiplayer is just janky for a game released in 2022. I'd give it a 6 out of 10 for these reasons, but single-player lovers will likely rate this closer to a 9 out of 10.",0
Negative,I want to love this game but it is constantly dropping framerate on a high end pc so annoying and crashes every once in awhile,0
Negative,"Port Bad, Game good. would recommend on Console if accessible. Other then That I highly suggest Waiting for more patches to the PC version, but if stuff like that doesn't bother you. then please. I beg you. If you Love Souls Games. Just play it. It is worth your time. Clearly it was worth my time, regardless of the PC Port Performance.",0
Negative,"They are not hiding the ball anymore. Just about every enemy reads your button presses. There is a sincere devotion to making the game beautiful but, at the same time, giving you bosses with infinite movesets and proximity attack dances that can go infinitely. At this point, the developers just want to make the bosses as close to unbeatable as they can. I sincerely regret buying the DLC.",0
Negative,"When it works, it is a great time. When it doesn t, it is an tedious and frustrating experience.I ll start off by listing a few things I actually enjoyed. I think the combat is the best in the series. There are so many cool weapons that make me want to start a new game just to be able to use them. New moves are also neat (if unbalanced, I m looking at you, jumping attack) and they tend to flow from one to another smoothly. Magic is just so creative in its visuals and use, finally making hybrid characters a thing because of the sheer amount and versatility of them.Some bosses and legacy dungeons (the main locations) are among the best in the series. Leyndell Castle is just a blast to go through because of the abundance of high-value collectibles and tough enemies. The way the world looks is just otherworldly. It is hard to believe that you can create an open world with landscape that looks this good. Animations are also top-tier, I don t think I ve seen an equivalent of the hawk guys from Dark Souls 2. The game simply looks stunning. Artistically. Technically it is a 8th gen-ass looking game. When the game decides to zoom in onto characters or objects the player experiences 3 consecutive mental breakdowns (just look up the cutscene after beating Maliketh). Some objects are very low-res (try using the mimic veil a few times), for some reason, and blood tends to stretch a lot on some surfaces, creating these unnatural stains. These are the least of the game s problems.Level design sucks and there is no going around it. Apart from a few places (most of which are legacy dungeons, the most polished locations) you typically go around samey looking dungeons, catacombs, caves and forts. Samey, because they are made from the exactly fricking same assets. This wouldn t be a problem if it wasn t obvious, but it sure as hell is. You can show someone footage from the dungeon from Limgrave and from the snowfields side by side and I guarantee that most people would think that it is the same place. These places contain very few types of enemies, offer lackluster rewards (seriously, I don t think I ve ever gained enough runes to level up from a dungeon) and are generally incredibly boring apart from a few which are very gimmicky and not always in a fun way.Speaking of lackluster rewards, the whole open world is like this. From Software are experienced in creating rather small and tight locations, typically interconnected, and this design philosophy could not be applied to an open world. This means that most places are very barren and, what s worse, contain seemingly random items. Imagine going through ruins which look exactly the same as the dozen or so you ve explored, fighting the same enemies you ve fought numerous times, finish the boss who is an enemy you ve bested before, and the reward is something that you cannot even use. It s just bad.Oh, and speaking of numbers, the game reuses tons of content. I am usually fine with this as long as the game doesn t make this obvious and uses this content in a clever way. This is not the case here, once again. Remember how in Dark Souls games reused bosses were typically minibosses (one-time enemies with no on-screen healthbars) or normal enemies? Well, here you can fight the exact same boss with pumped up numbers. And that s not all! How many bosses does the game have? I counted 169 on the wiki page. That s a shit ton of bosses. Oh, and how many of them are unique, i.e. you only fight them once in the entire game? 10. Yeah. That s bad. That s very, very bad. Sure, the amount of enemies in general is probably the highest in the series, but because the game is so bloated, it means that you will get sick and tired of most of them before the game ends. 12 f*cking Tree Spirits, 9 Erdtree Avatars, 9 Night Cavalries, 8 Deathbirds, 7 Crucible Knights, 6 Burial Dogs, and the list goes on and on. This doesn t even include normal enemies that are treated as bosses (you know about this huge flower that just stands in place and spews poison clouds? It is also a f*cking boss, TWICE), as well as NPCs that use player moves. Many of these bosses are also placed as regular enemies or minibosses. To put it into perspective: there are more Tree Spirits and Erdtree Avatars than **ALL** bosses in Dark Souls 3. F*cking unbelievable.And then there s the difficulty and balance. My brother in Christ, how badly can you screw this up? Most of the game goes like this: you are either way too powerful for a given challenge, rendering it meaningless, or you are underprepared, meaning that you will die in one or two hits whilst dealing unimpressive damage. There was rarely any time during my playthroughs that the game was fun and challenging at the same time. This is mostly because of the game s balance, or rather lack thereof. You see, a magic-based build will shred through most of the game, and using ashes (NPCs you can summon in some places, most notably boss encounters) makes most challenges non-existent. And that s not all. From Software wanted to make a challenging game so they bumped up enemy speed and damage. Moreover, many enemies (bosses included) now possess the ability to perform long and complex combos of multiple attacks. This looks cool and all, but it makes fights incredibly unpredictable. This wouldn t be a bad thing if the player character (not the player themself) could react to these attacks. They cannot.I wanted to beat Margit early. I was then using a great club, a slow and hefty strength weapon. This meant that when Margit was standing still and then I attacked him, he could retaliate faster than I could even move again. This meant that most of the damage I received came not from poor dodging or bad timing, but just from the fact that I was using a slow weapon and wanted to be aggressive. You know what is boring? Waiting for the boss to do this-one-attack that makes them vulnerable. It seems, however, that this is the way to go if you want to avoid damage. This sucks, obviously. But that s not all. Remember the long combos I mentioned? Well, bosses can finish attacking, wait a second or two, and then RESUME their attacks. This means that you can wait for the boss to stop attacking, come closer, attack yourself, and then receive damage. Oh, and some attacks are F*CKING UNDODGEABLE if you stand close to Margit (and some other bosses, you know which ones). This is just a baffling that makes fighting him early a chore. However, if you decide to level-up and get better healing, he becomes a joke that you can roll through. There is no good way to fight him without serious commitment you either die to him multiple times or demolish him instantly (which is what happened during our co-op playthrough).Oh, and speaking of the co-op playthrough holy f*cking s*it, it is one of the worst things I had a displeasure of experiencing. Latency is annoying, enemies tend to desynchronize making them stand still and do nothing while you kill them, the game F*CKING CRASHES when you decide to summon your friend who the game disconnected from your session (this happened like 100 times during our playthrough and I wish I was exaggerating, it is actually this bad). You can t use the horse meaning that going through the open world is tedious and slow. You cannot access other locations from the open world like caves, catacombs, or legacy dungeons so you have to send your friend away, go into the place and then resummons them again. Also, playing the game in co-op means that PvP is on and red phantoms can invade you (which happened a lot) and since the matchmaking is trash, most opponents were wielding weapons and spells we didn;t see for a few dozen hours.tl;dr: 7/10 solo, 6/10 co-op, don t recommend until major changes are made unless you crave more Dark Souls content no matter the quality.",0
Negative,"after 30 hours in the game, I've started to get frame stuttering + dropped frames and occasional black screens which I have heard other people complain about.

Negative,"Controller icons throughout the game, even while you are using a keyboard + mouse to play.Incredibly lazy port, not sure why they keep doing this. Over 700,000 active players on Steam now, guess it's not enough to prioritize the PC version.",0
Negative,The game would be good if not for the constant patches. And after the DLC it crashes most of the time I try to start it. And you know more patches are coming. I'm tired of having to constantly relearn the constantly changing stats and effects.,0
Negative,"This is the common core of video games. It's a very strong argument against cross-platform gaming, and even multiculturalism and why the whole great reset will never truly work. It's been like 20 years and for some reason they can't seem to grasp that these don't blend, and never will. But hey, you guys keep paying them fortunes for sub-par backwards junk, so they'll keep doing it.This game was developed on PCs to deliberately target the console. Everything had to be kept within the archaic and primitive restraints of the console. From the slow lazy pace of the game itself, to the confused menus and the shabby multiplayer. This isn't even a port back to the PC world, it's the actual release build for the console just thrown on the Steam store.",0
Negative,"Elden ring to me is a 10/10 game that has been stretched out to be a 7. Fromsoftware has kept a lot of the things that make these games amazing. like the creative enemies, the beautifull world, and the almost infinite number of weapons and build combinations. at this point these are things everyone expects from these games, so i dont think i need to go into it more. it has all the things that makes fromsoftware games good.HOWEVER there's several things that made this game unenjoyable to me.The thing i hated the most is the recycling of bossfights and enemies. In my opinion the amount of enemies should not be the factor of how high the difficulty is. at some point i'm done fighting erdtree avatars or gargoyle bosses. or dragons that all have the exact same moves besides the breathe they use. there's almost no bosses that do not come back in another fight at least once. and the bossfights with multiple bosses are often the most boring and frustrating fights in the game. most of the time you will just be sprinting around the bosses, waiting for them to do a certain attack pattern. Just so you have a window to attack once.This started getting particularly apparent to me in the ice area of the game. where you fight your 20th erdtree. 'but wait, this fight is different. this time it's 2 erdtrees.' or the castle which is almost a carbon copy of the other castles. and the enemies are exactly the same besides the fact that they're ghosts now. the end of the castle is obviously a more difficult version of a boss you have fought before. i think this stems from the main problem i have with this game. which is that it is stretched out to make it feel longer. and to make the open world not seem so empty. the first 50~ hours of the game are amazing. but after that it started feeling like a chore.",0
Negative,Worst console port ever - Refund requested.,0
Negative,And I thought we were recyling at home.,0
Negative,"The more I play the more I realize that every enemy and boss feels samey and boring. I've come across maybe two bosses I actually enjoyed fighting against and the rest of them just feel amazingly boring. I had fun struggling against Margit and I had to do a few tries against Godfrick too, they were decently fun, the rest of them are all the same, attack chains that last 8+ hits and some sort of magic projectile or aoe. and even when i kill them i don't tend to feel rewarded because i get 1/12th of my level in souls, or some magic garbageWhy does every enemy in this game have to have magic anyway, they all blend together into like three groups of enemies, and the magic casting ones make up the vast majority of all enemies. Same goes for the bosses, either they're regular enemies with fancier healthbars, or they're some dude that has melee and magic. Everything fucking has magic in this gameThe good parts in the game is the open world exploration, which was really nice, and at the start it felt nice to explore and find new stuff but nearing the mid and end it gets more and more boring when you never get rewarded for it appropriately. The horsecow is so-and-so, it's fine for getting from place to place but i have some issues with it too, like how easily it gets stunlocked and how it walks an extra step forward when you turn to walk backThis is most likely the first Souls game I don't WANT to finish. Every new thing they introduced was great, but it suffered so bad in the core gameplay. Every time I think I'm about to have fun with a miniboss or whatever, they get to half hp and all they do anymore is magic. Easily, by far, the worst lineup of bosses and enemies FromSoft has come up with",0
Negative,"The stuttering is very annoying, and I will wait until it is fixed, very unfortunate that another AAA game is released like this.",0
Negative,this game is extremely poorly optimized for pc. An msi gaming x trio rx6800xt and a ryzen 7 5800x struggles to run it. dont buy this game wait a bit for patches or if you're desperate wait for it to go on sale,0
Negative,"Honestly, it is a decent game at best, probably very mid at worse. Firstly, let's start off with the story. what story? You come out of this crypt/graveyard into a strange world with very little exposition. and you just start killing stuff? It is the exact same idea as washing up on a remote island and immediately start murdering the locals because some random person told you to. People claim that this has a deep story hidden in item descriptions etc. I am very sorry, but if a story needs to be told through that method, it is an objectively bad story with a poor overarching narrative. Flavour text in item descriptions should ENHANCE the story, not BE the story. Just because a story is confusing, does not make it a deep/interesting one. Also, why should the player care about any of the rest of the game if they don't even know what the motives of their character really are? While the open world is a visual masterpiece, it is incredibly soulless. For an example, Limgrave; all the ruins in that area use the same texture set, rinse and repeat. There are also vast spaces of nothingness which make the place feel so incredibly empty. The dungeons are a snooze, I could tell they were copy paste affairs from the ones I explored during my 9 hours. Not very appealing if you ask me. The ai also suck monkey balls in this open world game. They have the vision range of an elderly corgi and can be totally cheesed using some boulders/a brick wall. The horse riding is very well done though.The Ui/menus are hot garbage and are way more clunky than they actual need to be. Also, the default keybinds are irredeemably bad. The lack of simple tooltips to explain what each stat does in the level up menu for example is plain bad design. A game should be able to explain what each stat does in its own game. I should not have to look up a wiki just to understand something as basic as that. The lack of a quest journal is incredibly poor (even one where you need to write in it yourself), especially when the NPC's that you do meet give such vague instructions. Again, one should not have to look up a guide on how to do a quest. It is simply lazy writing/quest design. Hell, the fact that there are many guides online on how to even find sidequests tells me that the game does a trash job of organically leading players to the locations of these side quests during the overarching narrative.The combat is a snooze, especially against boss enemies. I am no stranger to hard, melee orientated games, but the combat in this game is just dull. Most of the time spent is either dodging or blocking as you wait for enemies to finish their attack combos so you can get a couple of hits in. It doesn't help that the punish window is tiny and meta builds for bosses are rampant which tells me that the overall boss design is poor if players are forced to cheese them to make them fair and look up guides online to even understand how to defeat them. The input buffering in this game is objectively bad and leads to so much unnecessary frustration (especially when fighting bosses). The camera is also horrendous which does not at all help matters.Overall, this game has flaws, many of them and people need to be cognisant of this because the worship cult this game has is bad and toxic. Also, you're welcome to tell me to ""get gud"", or something similar. Rest assured, I am good, and can thrive in games where enemies and bosses and actually built and designed well with telegraphed attacks, no obnoxious one hit wonder moves and no trashy input buffering actively hindering players.",0
Negative,"This would 100% be the best game released for a very long time if the problems it has had been fixed by now. The stuttering and connection errors ruin it. The stuttering apparently doesn't happen for everyone but it's annoying enough to slowly become a problem even when you have high patience for these things.The connection issues however, when you mainly want to play these games too play with your friends then it gets really frustrating, again I'm pretty sure this issue isn't happening to everyone but me and my friends all seem too suffer from it which makes it very hard too enjoy coop. I'm a huge souls fan, played them all countless times. I would still recommend Elden Ring too everyone but I'm just disappointed with the PC version being such a terrible port and it still not being addressed.EDIT: Well we're back for the DLC, performance is garbage, whatever they have done in either the DLC patch or any leading up to it, has bought some terrible stuttering and freezing with some what frequent crashes to boot.The DLC itself is just lack luster, so far I'm around 18 hours in and 90% of my time has been going around the open world that is just empty, there has been nothing worth going out of your way for aside from a single talisman, the few other interesting finds have been in places that you can't miss like the areas you have to go in order to progress the game. At least in the base game there was a really large amount of caves to find yielding lots of different things but the DLC just doesn't feel like it has anything like that.The absolute biggest let down and disappointment of this whole thing however are the new weapon types, Light Greatswords are kinda cool, they have a very smooth move set and they perform okayish next to normal greatswords minus the poise damage but the biggest hype for me at least was the Martial arts weapons for some Bruce lee action, Fromsoft should honestly be ashamed with the Dryleaf Arts, they're super slow, no damage and a crazy boring move set, they should have just copy and pasted the bone first move set from DS2 and they would have been golden. I've seen that there is a different one which looks like it has a slightly better move set towards the end of the DLC, I'll update this if it is any better but my hopes for anything were honestly destroyed a few hours in.Lastly, all the enemies are boring, they're just juggernauts with their HP and high poise, sure they do a lot of damage too but that is what dodging is for but they're just not interesting at all, they all resemble enemies that are already in the game or previous souls titles with reused move sets minus the odd few, the odd few being the main bosses which aren't hard at all, Fromsofts level of difficulty is just making the bosses relentless with never ending combos so it feels less hard and more just a forced attempt at trying to catch you out.Having played all Fromsofts games with thousands of hours across platforms it's fair to say I am a massive fan of the souls series and it breaks my heart seeing stuff like this get pushed out, people argue Elden Ring is a master piece and despite all the problems there is a good couple hundred hours of enjoyment there but it could have been so much more, and the DLC which they are charging Expansion prices for, 34.99 is honestly just disgraceful, apparently an average of 30-40 hours of game time will be in this DLC but at least 70% of that is going to be riding around like an idiot believing that there is going to be something interesting waiting for you in the open world to find when in reality it is just empty space which could have been filled with items or cool enemies, so that's a big price tag for 10 hours, if you're slow, of actual content.EDIT No.2: Having spent 54ish hours on the DLC now, finished all there is to do, I stand by what I said above, most of my game time is searching areas and spaces that seem like they should have stuff but end up having nothing and just being a massive waste of time or a massive disappointment. The end boss is cool though so that's at least one positive to add from my previous edit and if you seek out the story for the DLC the ending of it all was a good one, so without any spoilers make sure to do all the side quests and interact with every NPC there is to get the most out of that and one last positive is that the Dryleaf Arts second weapon the Danes footwork is a big improvement on the first garbage one you find but you also need to find it's second ash of war to make it more fun to use.All in all I didn't have a very good time in the DLC, other than being very pretty so the map and areas are all well made, there just isn't much there to fill the space other than disappointment for 34.99, It would have been much better if the areas were a bit smaller so you didn't waste so much time hoping for something that isn't there and as usual fromsofts multiplayer sucks but the Seamless Co-Op mod will be out within the week so if you're interested in the best possible experience wait for a bit and play with a friend or two through the Seamless Co-Op mod because that's how the game should have been from the start.",0

Negative,"I agree with Dunkey. Whomever is responsible for damage/exp balancing just didn't show up for work the entire time of development. The number of bosses and enemies that can kill you in 2 hits is too damn high. If you have max 99 vigor, you may be able to take 3 or 4 hits. It's ridiculous. Boss level difficuly enemies will have garbage exp and it's not rewarding beating them. For the effort required to beat some late game enemies that wander around the wild, the exp you get is honestly insulting. So everyone just defaults to farming the same sleeping enemies on a cliff that gives you 100k exp per minute in NG1.There are also some bosses that have speedy bloodborne movesets while you have slow darksouls moveset to deal with them. They'll have near infinite stamina and can pull of 12 hit combos while killing you in 2 hits. You have to be extremely reactive to their punish windows to get in your 1 hit and then wait for them to finish their next combo. It's a pretty tired formula for me. I'd rather have some proactive instead of reactive boss gameplay. Enemies can also hit through terrain and obstacles while your attacks are blocked. For a lot of large boss fights, 50% of the battle is against the camera angles, especially since this time around they like to put some huge enemies in small rooms. Now let's talk about everyone's worst enemy, the camera angles, that will frequently get you killed in close quarters. If you lose direct sight for less than a second, like behind a pillar, you will lose lock on and turn around so the enemy stabs you in the back. Some non-humanoid enemies also have sub-optimal lock on targets points that are not the body part closest to you, so many of your weapon movesets just swing in the empty air hitting nothing, while the enemy weak spot, the head, just dangles on top of your missed swings and stabs/bites you. There is no way to turn off target auto switching when you move the mouse when using the KB+mouse setup. This is a huge oversight, but otherwise, the mouse+KB plays a lot better than previous titles. The ashes of war crafting menu also doesn't let you view the description, and if you assign it to a weapon, it disappears from the inventory so you can't view it there either. You have to unequip to view the descriptions. It's little blunders that add up to a frustrating experience to an already frustrating game. Poise is also a huge problem again in this game. You and the enemies do not use the same system. In PVE, enemies do either 50 or 100 poise damage, 1 or 2 handed respectively. Like 80% of the armor sets in the game won't even meet the 50 poise breakpoint, and less than a handful will reach 100. Meanwhile your moves do at most 30 something poise with ultra great hammers and takes 4 jump 2-hand heavies to stagger a tough enemy like crucible knight. When you get the crucible knight armor and stack on a poise talisman can you tank that many hits? Hell no. You won't even be able to take one 2-handed hit. So you have found the best poise armor and talisman in the game and have 133 poise. Yay! right? Guess what? rats and dogs will still stagger you no matter what. The main storyline game is fine for the most part until end game when the difficulty curve goes pretty high. I would rather have a more linear polished experience than this open world with uneven production values and inadequate playtesting. Worth trying out if you really like the souls formula. There are a lot of pluses and additions but a lot of rough edges too. So you've beaten all the content and became the lord! What do you get? The endings are all basically a few 30 second snippets with a few lines of changed dialogue.",0

Negative,"Extremely minor spoilers ahead, kept as vague as possible.Elden Ring. is not a bad game. But it an absolutely mediocre game that delights in wasting your time and effort, and could have been so much better.Part 1: Presentation.About half of the overworld, and frankly most of the underworld, of Elden Ring just looks like you're playing Skyrim except that the enemies are more malnourished. You can tell what you're looking at, but considering 40-ish hours of gameplay, I would have expected more than one visual design that stuck with me.The music is both omnipresent and non-present, there are two overworld tracks(spooky and not spooky) and about as many underworld tracks(slightly spooky and very spooky), and then a mess of blaring horns and strings that kick in when you aggro something sufficiently large. I can't remember a single note from any of them after closing the game.Part 2A: Gameplay(Controls)The controls have issues. Overall, there's nothing wrong with the ideas behind them, but for gameplay that works best with a controller, they seem to also desire a controller with several more buttons. There is a button that sneaks(unmounted) or dismounts you(mounted). This button is the push-down-on-left-stick option. Some folks, like myself, want neither of these options when in stressful, high-speed situations. However, some folks, like myself, also clench their hands a bit when in stressful, high-speed situations that require using the left stick.Pushing down on the right stick is your lock-on/recenter camera, which is theoretically less bad except the game is INSANELY fiddly about when it will lock on to things or not, so it may suddenly swing your camera around 90 or 180 degrees rather than locking on as intended. I have never wanted to use the recenter camera option, it should just not exist.Lastly, your character is the most unrushed videogame protagonist ever. No matter what's going on, they always have time for a little flourish(try to cast a spell when out of Faith? Your character has a couple of seconds of un-interruptible ""wiggle the staff in confusion""-animation, same goes for accidentally trying to drink from an empty bottle, real great in tense fights!) and when they've gotten knocked on their ass they take their time like they're getting out of bed in the morning to dust themselves off, adjust their shoes, check themselves in the mirror and have a cup of coffee before they'll respond to controls.Part 2B: Gameplay(The World)So the big thing about Elden Ring over other Soulslikes is having a more open and explorable world. And it delivers on that. There's so much world. You won't believe how damn much world there is, it's insane. Like it is genuinely huge and. it feels like they overreached on that. They had more world than they had content.Like, there are tons of caves and mini-dungeons and stuff but. after a while I just started skipping them, because most of them didn't contain anything of importance, and I had equal chances of finding a super-great weapon upgrade on a random skeleton hanging over a window sill in easy reach as I did at the bottom of a dungeon past a boss that kicked me around.The same goes for exploring the world. 99% of the time, exploring to the highest peak, lowest pit, easternmost point, etc. in Elden Ring, mostly you get flipped off for bothering. Like you'll find a crafting component you could have collected 100 of in five minutes of effrt, except for the 1 time out of 100 where it's a necessary component for a quest or really IS a weapon upgrade or rare NPC or spell.Some open-world bosses and minibosses also do not quite understand that they're in the open world rather than a carefully curated arena and will get stuck on terrain, forget how to navigate up ledges or try to attack you with a breath weapon through unbreakable terrain while you whittle them down.Part 2C: Gameplay(Mechanics)Mechanics is a bit of an arbitrary distinction since technically everything in the game is a game mechanic or ties into one, but I choose to say it's more about the underlying systems. Like, for instance.It's got a crafting system now. So you collect hundreds of thousands of random thingummies around the game world and. really the only use I've found for them is crafting anti-rot items(though that recipe is damn easy to miss), because you'll want those for one(1) area in the game and ammunition for archery.And it doesn't work. Like, in other games with limited resources and enemies, crafting is for making choices about what to have and where and when. Sacrificing one resource for another, sometimes, because of your playstyle or expected challenges. So they should've run the ammunition and consumables on the same system as the faith/health flasks. I.e. limited per rest, with upgradeable capacity.Other systems that need work are Sorcery. You can absolutely play as a Sorcerer, and there are absolutely good spells. But more so than other classes, things are binary. Instead of gradual gear upgrades, one good staff can insanely jump you up, and with the way the open world is, it's very easy to trivialize zones by lucking into a good staff or having a hard time because you did not stumble into it. Add to that, that even after collecting what I assume to be over half the spells in the game, 40 or 50 of the things, I still only have three or four spells that I consider consistently useful. The rest are either downright bad, super-gimmicky or only useful in very narrow situations.It would also be nice if something indicated spell ranges since NONE of them have the same range and nothing on the UI indicates when you are, or aren't, in range.The game also feels pretty grindy if you want to do anything but superspecialize, thanks to the generally increasing level-up costs. I feel like it would have worked better if it was increasing costs per stat.Part 3: The ""Story""I know that it seems to be a Soulslike thing that you're given a vague description, and then everyone in the world just tells you one or two vague things when you meet them and refuses to elaborate, but in Elden Ring I really found it to be excessive. A lot of things I found myself doing, I was either doing because it was the only way forward or because it made some sort of dream logic sense to my character, but. I felt like there was a missing internal logic.Part of it is that sometimes characters will go ""AH YES, EXCELLENT, LET US MEET AND DO A THING."" And then just vanish, without telling you where to meet or where they'll be, like, I'm not asking for a map marker even, just give me a name! A compass direction! Say it's by a big rock or something! I could probably have put up with a lot of the other issues if the story and characters had motivated me, but ultimately the strongest feelings I ever had towards a character was ""you have a cool hat"" or ""really? THAT'S how you pronounce that name?""Other times you get prompts for completely deranged things, like you find a dying-looking beggar moaning in a cave, and rather than prompts to (Y) Put Him Out of His Misery or (Y) Give Him A Sandwich, the prompt is instead (Y) Give Him A Suit Of Armor. Like SURE. Sure. Let's do that. Why not. Or I can hop into a stone coffin and ride down a waterfall of liquefied meat.Part 4: ConclusionI really can't imagine playing this game without a wiki to hand, if I was to give it another shot again in the future, simply to help me know where to go to not waste my time. Because considering the amount of unrewarding, copypasted-feeling and frankly *boring* things the world is stuffed with, I'd want to know where the stuff worth my time is(either in terms of being interesting, challenging or having nice loot), so I can skip past the rest.Note: Original review was longer, but, uh, about 8000 characters too long to post. Trust me, I have more and more detailed complaints.",0
Negative,"This is one of those games that requires a ""neutral"" rating. I'll rate it negatively to offset a bit the ""very positive"" rating which, I think, is misleading.First of all, let's get ""multiplayer"" out of the way : it's crap, and the worst thing is, it's even MORE crap if you intend to play alone. The world is literally littered with ghosts and ""messages"" from other players, some of which are actually about the game, thus removing any tension (""hey. beware. big boss in next room"") other being pointless and stupid (""dumdidum was here! yay""). The only way to actually enjoy the (really beautiful) world without being spammed with obnoxious grafitis is to switch to ""offline"" in the settings. This I definitely recommend.Performance seems to be an issue on Windows, but as I'm playing on Linux (no. not even on a Deck) it's running flawlessly :)Once you turned off the online mode, it turns out it's a decent (maybe a bit overpriced) game.""decent"" . not actually ""good""It's probably the grindiest game I've ever played. even beats many MMORPGs in that respectand there is a distinct absence of . ""lore""You have a wonderfully detailed world, but it's all very very soulless (and that's not even meant as a pun, considering it's part of the ""Soul"" serie). You run around, kill everything in sight, so that you can grind your levels up to go kill bigger stuff, but there is no actual ""point"" except getting to the end boss. Everything else will try to kill you, except for a couple of NPCs (who will repeat their 2 sentences endlessly) and cut-scene characters who will mumble some mystically enhanced crap that is basically ""kill everything and kill big boss, then world is saved, you're the one."" . zero points for originality.As the mobs respawn everytime you hit a checkpoint you can just kill everything, walk to checkpoint, click it, and go back to kill the same low level mobs all over again, without any surprises or anything. once you've leveled enough or got enough better gear you can move to the next area. rinse and repeat. The AI is also utterly dumb . or, more precisely, not existent. Mobs will repeat their pattern mindlessly, even if that means stepping over their breathren's corpses. There is absolutely no awareness of the world, NPC wise. They do react when they see or hear the player, but their senses are severely limited in terms of range and aoe, and their short-term memory is absolutely abysmal. For all that matters every non-boss mob is nothing but a zombie with some fighting skill.Honestly, Thief1 dates from 1998 and even its memory-impeded guards were searching for ye old taffer for longer and more throughly, and reacted to changes in their surroundings. Why a game in 2022 can't be bothered to implement something at least halfway believable on par with a game from 1998 is beyond me.The matter of fact is that this removes any credibility and life from the world. if actions don't have consequences then why bother and why be interested in it?Combat is a two button affair with, for fighters, a roll evasion button. Didn't try mage so far, but apparently it's even more basic. Death means you get back to the checkpoint, lose your ""souls"" (basically money and exp) and can give it another try.It's a more MMORPG'ish singleplayer game than even Borderlands, and that's saying something.That's not to say that It isn't a nice game, it's just not particularly good nor innovative or interesting *FOR A PC GAME*. The console origin really shows, permanence is basically nil.if you want mindless repetitive stuff within a beautifully modeled (but ultimately lifeless) world that really lends itself for exploration (as long as you ground your level up enough to pass the next mob-category) then this game is for you.",0

Negative,"This game is poorly optimised. It is quite slow even on desktop systems with more than 8 Zen cores and the graphics set to the lowest settings.Playing the game with Proton under Linux made it a lot smoother. The game crashes because Easy Anti-Cheat can't be loaded. This wasn't a problem until today.Some people buy this game for the Steam Deck. It runs poorly on the Steam Deck as well now. The latest SteamOS 3.3 seems to have made it slower. I use FSR with a resolution lower than the native 1280x800 on the Steam Deck. The frame rate dips below 30 in some areas.The game crashed a few times on the Steam Deck. Many of the other games I've played don't crash on the Steam Deck.Summoned creatures and the enemies have animations which stutter during fights. I've never seen a game do this before.This game could've been great. The numerous technical problems, poor performance and bugs make it difficult to recommend. I wanted a great experience while playing this game. Elden Ring could've delivered if the developers actually bothered to fix the bugs and improve performance. Perhaps they really don't have the people with the required skills?I give this game 4 out of 10 due to the numerous technical problems. The price is too high for a buggy and unstable game such as this one. Would I buy it again knowing this? Only in a few years when the bugs are fixed and when it's discounted by 50%.update: The 1.06 update hasn't addressed the performance issues. The game still has low frame rates in most open areas. It also tends to stutter when the frame rate drops to 30 or less.The EAC on Linux issue has been discussed here: https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/6051. You'll want to try to install custom glibc packages to work around Epic Games' decision to use DT_HASH for EAC. Arch Linux users can use the custom packages to fix the issue until Epic Games fixes EAC.update: The glibc package has been fixed to allow the EAC malware to work again. The game now starts once in 15-20 attempts to run it.Steam Deck also gets stuck at the white screen sometimes.I'm lowering my rating to 3 out of 10 due to the incompetence of the people who have developed this game.update on the 20th of June, 2024: The game starts on Linux and complains about ""inappropriate activity"".

Negative,"For context I am neither a drooling From Software fanatic nor a casual gamer (and I am likely to maybe perhaps offend either demographic as I edit this review over time).On the technical side:Terrible performance not at all justified by the outdated visuals, borderline impossible to beat a boss because stuttering will get you killed before it dies Later part fixed on linux no thanks to From Software, don't worry I'm sure microsoft will push an update to bandaid the stuttering on windows while FromSoft continues to ignore it, any day now. :)Locked to 60 fps like we're in the 90s or something.Forced vsync too, no option to disable it.No way to completely disable camera reset which makes m&kb (even more of) a pain to use Took a while but they finally added an option to disable it, too bad it took so long I went ahead and bought a controller just to be able to play but at least I get to disable it while playing with my controller too, absolutely awful camera behavior I have no idea why they even made it the default in all their games; you still have to use cheat engine to disable it in DS3 to this day.The game will not let you rebind everything if you're using m+kb, and the available keybinds are nonsensical forcing you to use the same control scheme as a controller leading to stupid uses of the Esc key or the inability to bind inventory items to specific keys, for instance, just because controllers are so extremely limited; so I guess you should be even more limited for daring to use a more versatile control scheme which happens to be the default on the platform you bought the game for. As usual PC is only seen as a secondary cash cow despite being a huge chunk of the sales in spite of the numerous issues.No way to play online on linux because of EAC Now working.Will edit as/if that dumpster fire gets fixed, and add a paragraph about the non-technical side once I finish the game.

Negative,"Game is addicting like the previous titles, but this one is riddled with issues. Lots of connectivity issues that plenty of people are complaining about. Lots of people getting connection errors mid session, which kicks you from the game. Worst part is, if this happens too many times you get automatically banned from all multiplayer for a while. Nice, huh?Performance does NOT impress here. Frame drops with specs WELL above recommended. 9900k 2080ti etc plus i've even turned a few things down its still happening, sometimes dropping more than 30 fps in some spots. Also had a few crash to desktops as well.Other minor complains and gripes over design choices and balance such as enemies can hit you through walls while yours typically bounce off and recoil you. Not only physical attacks but sometimes spells go right through objects too. Also some of the bosses are way too big. You can't see when you need to dodge if you're in melee range because all you can see is their foot and part of their leg. This makes some of the bosses harder in a way that's not fun at all.",0
Negative,"Terrible optimization for one of the best games ever made, stay away till they fix it, if they can off course. Otherwise buy it on consoles. It's 2022 this kind of performance is unacceptable.",0
Negative,"This was a tough one to have to write. I have got almost 50 hours into the game at this point and am continuing to grow more and more disinterested with every passing hour. As someone who has never enjoyed the vast emptiness and ""exploration"" of copy and pasted content across open world games, I was a bit more hopeful for Elden Ring. I figured hey, it might be huge but it should at least have a good bit of the fantastic level design of previous souls games. Spoiler alert, it doesn't.The game definitely loses its sheen the more it goes on. Limgrave was a decent section to introduce you to the game and once I got to Stormveil I thought I was sold on the game. It was that solid tightly designed section that I was hoping to see. Unfortunately, I now believe that is the exception within Elden Ring, instead of the norm. There are certainly a few cool places, but they are outnumbered by the large, empty, bland world of ER. And even the exploration that exists feels generally pointless. The gameplay loop is basically this. Run around till you find a dungeon, explore it, realize it's the exact same as a bunch of previous dungeons, kill the boss, get some extremely underwhelming item for your time. Rinse and repeat.Aside from all that, I feel the game has very odd difficulty spikes scattered throughout it that lend themselves to another aspect of open world games that I despise, and that would be grinding/farming. The one thing that could really bring me back into this game would be if it was easier to swap builds. Sure, you can respec your character easy enough. But grinding smithing stones is an incredibly painful experience that takes away the desire to try new builds, and given the large amount of emptiness in the game, I certainly don't want to make a new character just to spend 30 hours getting to a point where any given build becomes fun to play.I am somewhere around the mid point of the game and I am not sure I can will myself to finish this one. And to be honest, I am incredibly disappointed that this is how I feel. Especially considering that I seem to be the outlier when it comes to my opinions of this game.",0
Negative,"Okay. I lost every littlebit of interest in this game. I gave it another try but its just no fun. I played DS1 , DS2 and DS3.Finished all of them.

Nice. basic stuff every Indie dev does is not possible for AAA Devs. But still the game was playable. I just needed to remember the buttons. I started the game and played. Classic Dark Souls like direct boss. Thats fine. Than came the open world. The world looks stunning and I can see the whole map. Well. you know what I mean. Everything I saw I was able to reach and walk up too. Would be REALY FKIN NICE TOO HAVE THIS WITH MY BASICLY PICTURE LIKE MONITOR but okay. I played and played and played. And was let down. By the open world. The world is empty. Well there is sheit everywhere to loot but most of the times its just berry 10000000000000000000 or flower 20000000000000 . So I stopped looking because I was so bored of the map. THIS was a mistake ofc! Because the good stuff or needed stuff I didnt find anymore because the map was so boring and I could expect key Item XY behind tree XYZ because of lore reason I could read on Item XYZAlphaGama ""Person so and so died there with mega important item XY"" . I know its MY problem. just run everywhere and loot the everyliving given sheit out of this map. Its not bad to have EVERYTHING. So the open world ruined it for me in this point. Heartbroken I moved on. Now with a bigger challange because I would miss so much. I found the horse-cow. And the combat was the worst I ever saw. Attacks I did went thru the enemy and did nothing. Like the hit didnt connect at all. Sword to short? Next try even closer. I saw the blade go thru the body. still no DMG. Okay. Fk that and I went on with the jorney and was frustrated. I went to the first boss. Fought him pretty well! And had a lucky moment! He jumped back so far! Oh boy! ""Now hes doing a backflip while suiciding!"" I thought. Nope. Invisible Wall is Invisible. He was standing in the air and fell to the ground in the move of flying down. We thought and I died . Okay. tried a few times sat down on Bonfire (for me it will ALWAYS be a Bonfire) suddenly Maiden apears. Said I was to weak and she wanted to test me yapping. I thought the same and wanted to continue to explore the sheit openworld. Thought a few enemys and always had the same problems. Stuff I thought I would break while rolling didnt break. Stuff I expect to be invincible was desturctable. (Same in the Boss fight btw). And I gave up completly. I gave this game every little chance. But the devs ruin it , the core gameplay of the open world was bad and the fights didnt feel good at all. Letdown expierence. Sadly I cant retourn this game and get my money back. Comments are allowed. Make fun of me. Say ""git gud"" all you want or jester me. I give a damn",0
Negative,"Might be a decent game on PC eventually. Feels like a console game, even if you attempt to play on keyboard and mouse. Trying to play that way is difficult, though, because none of the tutorial recognizes that you are using a keyboard: it only tells you what button to press on a controller. And you can't figure out default keybindings based on the conventions established by every other PC game over two decades. Here, you press F to jump, space to dodge/run, etc.I also had an issue with intermittent lag, the game freezing for a second or so randomly. Tried reducing graphics settings even though I shouldn't need to, and it made no difference. FPS is fine on high settings, but the game just randomly hiccups whatever I have it set to. I came very close to asking for a refund, but even though I doubt it will live up to its hype I know that I'll eventually want to try it again. Just not until after a patch or two.[Edit: my specs are RTX 2070, i7-6700 CPU @ 3.40GHz, 32 GB RAM]",0
Negative,"As a fan of FromSoft games since Dark Souls, this one is honestly a pretty big letdown. The difficulty is all over the place once you get past the early game; 70% of bosses can easily be completed on your first or second try with a good build, 20% are a challenge in line with my expectations for the series, and 10% are among the most frustrating experience I've had in a game. I expect a challenge, but some bosses have attack patterns that have no apparent way to avoid being hit (the final boss and ""super boss"" in particular are both guilty of this).To work around this difficulty, you have two options: build **extremely** tanky to survive the inevitable hits, or never let the boss attack. My winning runs against the hardest bosses in the game were ones where I ran in and spammed my strongest moves to stagger and kill the boss before they did anything scary, and sometimes even before they went into their second phase. I don't feel like I ""overcame a challenge,"" I feel like I skipped a boss that could have been fun. The same goes for the easy bosses: I killed many bosses before I even saw half their moves.In short, this is not the finely tuned experience I expect from a FromSoft game. It is plagued by balance issues, and while those can be corrected by patches (which they have already begun to do), the current experience is disappointing and unrewarding.",0
Negative,"Until From Software and AMD really sit down and talk, I can't say it's a good game. I have spent 10 hours troubleshooting and 3 hours playing the game. I have a AMD Ryzen 7 3700X and a Radeon 6700 XT. I more than meet the minimum requirements. I have the latest Radeon drivers supposedly tweaked for Elden Ring, Windows 10 is updated, every setting I can think of is tweaked for maximum performance, but I can't play for more than 5 minutes until the Radeon driver times out. I'm on my last leg and I'm about to request a refund. It does seem like a fun game, it's a shame I can't play it. Wait until they've made this an actual PC game, not just a Xbox direct port.EDIT: Update from a few days after this review. I was able to play for two hours tonight! NO CRASHES! I have a ritual I will perform- I clear all temporary files, go to Disk Cleanup and remove the Directx shader caches, and then I pray to Merika herself! I'll change my recommend to Yes when I no longer fear the white screen of death!",0
Negative,"Just not for me. Not a fan of the really weird style of delayed attacks. The controls are wonky and weird. And some of the systems just. don't work. There were a few times where my parries just acted like regular blocks instead of being actual parries, and it just makes the act of trying to do these things feel useless.I'm probably one in a million, but I just don't think it's all that good of a game. Too many weird issues that seemingly get glazed over by every single game-critic studio out there.",0
Negative,"Cannot recommend the game for now as the game will not boot. White screen then crashes, every time. Widely known issue with several 'workarounds', none of the fixes sadly worked for me. Had to refund the game. Will see if a future update fixes the game.",0
Negative,Where to begin? It feels like a badly ported console game. The controls are wonky and the fighting system is not suited for mouse and keyboard. The tutorial was barely adequate and once you get to the open world it seems to lose connection to the server quite often. It's just not enough to keep me interested. If it goes down to >$20 maybe. Definitely not worth $60.,0
Negative,Am i missing something or is this not a PC game?,0
Negative,It is probably awesome but i was getting 20-25 FPS with a 3080 TI and 32g of RAM.,0
Negative,Bad Perfomance. Stutters when loading new stuff and FPS isnt really that great either.Dont buy yet rather wait until its patched.,0
Negative,"Just like Dark Soul 3 there is no real difficulties, there is just artificial difficulties, an example of this would be you dodging a boss attack and before you can even get up from the roll the boss is already hitting you with another combo which does half your health with each attack. It is also a terrible port just like DS3 was and is basically a giant buggy mess.",0
Negative,I'm sure playing this on console is a blast but this port is just bad. I thought when the reviews went from mixed to mostly positive some of the items should have been fixed but nope. menus are frustrating. key binds are frustrating. the IU is just frustrating. did they not play test this on a PC and why was it not addressed prior to launch.,0
Negative,"This game is broken on my PC. The stutters are substantial and occur too frequently. I have a 2060 SUPER and I've tried all the methods that help with issues that are being talked about on Reddit. The optimizations helped the over all FPS, however there are still large stutters often (even after the assets have been loaded in for the first time). I do not recommend this game. It's unplayable on PC. No matter how much I lower the resolution it simply won't do the one thing it HAS to do, run at a locked 60 FPS. I need to git gud at not wasting money on games that don't work.",0
Negative,"The controls for this game are not intuitive. The combat is unresponsive and not fluid. The tutorial is uninformative. The map system is unclear. The community is at best unhelpful, at worst toxic. I would not recommend this game for anyone. Too bad I figured this out 0.4 hours too late for a refund.",0
Negative,"Pretty bad PC port. FPS locked to 60, which causes tearing on my 75 Hz monitors. No FOV slider or option do disable vignetting (which gives me headeache). Easy Anti-Cheat makes things even worse.Fortunately all of this can be fixed with Flawless Widescreen. But still, the game has terrible performance. Regardless of graphical settings or resolution it barely can keep up with 55-60 FPS in open areas. I tried 1440p and 1080p. Minimum settings and maximum settings. Literally changed nothing, not even a single frame per second.When I engaged the first horse-boss after the tutorial, the game started to have a seizure and dropped framerate to 15 for several seconds. I died instantly, because I couldn't dodge properly. I tried couple more times and the same kept happening. Refunded, unfortunately.",0
Negative,"After beating this game twice and playing every game FromSoftware has released since Demon Souls it pains me to give this a negative review. I want to preface this with the clarification that if this is your first FromSoftware game chances are you will enjoy it immensely. However as a fan of these games for over 10 years now I can't help but feel that this game regresses or lacks from improvements on aspects I deem important and enjoyable. The game is certainly larger in world and pure content than any other souls game (I call it that specifically for reasons explained later) that came before it. There are more bosses, weapons, items than ever before. It terms of core game play it's what many would expect from a souls game. If you were wishing for another game nearly identical in combat to Dark Souls 3, then this game would definitely be up your alley. However I expected more, or at least different.The PVP as of the time of this review is the most unbalanced among all the souls games at release. Due to the large amount of exploits and frankly broken weapon arts the PVP is monotonous, tedious, and unfun even by DS3 standards. This is made more annoying due to the constant connection errors and lag. It is possible that these things get patched out in the future, but FromSoft doesn't really have a great record when it comes to fixing these things. It is a shame too because the variety in builds which is one of it's strongest aspects is severely stunted due to this.The problems I have with this game would not be nearly as severe if it wasn't for it using the same exact formula gameplay and story wise as the dark souls trilogy. I feel that if they wanted to make a game with the same combat as a souls game they should of just made dark souls 4 because that is what this game feels like. That's not necessarily a bad thing but I think due to this formula starting to show it's age that it is. While the game initially feels as good as ever with more options for builds compared to previous games, the bosses and encounters have started to regress. In previous games there has always been maybe a few bad apples for boss encounters and one where they try something unique that is always hit or miss. In Elden Ring I feel like that number is substantially higher due to the developers over designing many of the bosses in attempt to keep one upping an old formula leaving many encounters feeling unsatisfying. Many of these bosses have similarities of feeling really epic at first, but 20 seconds into the fight it becomes annoying and frustrating. whether it's abysmal camera angles or moves/combos that become tedious and borderline impossible to deal with. Not only that but the difficulty for bosses for me personally was only a ""I did this boss in 3 tries or less"" or ""I did this boss after grinding it for 2 hours"". Neither of those left me with the usual satisfaction of killing a hard boss in a souls game save for a few exceptions. The amount of bosses that utilize delayed attacks to the same effect as Nameless King from DS3 is really too much and indicates to me that they are struggling with unique and good boss designs. The previous issue is just made more frustrating and annoying given the issues I have with the change to a more open world direction, the repetition. In previous games when you picked up an item it was almost always a unique item or a consumable worth using. Especially in those hard to reach areas or hidden spots. In Elden Ring it feels like they just padded the world with ingredients for the new crafting system which feels extremely last minute. I practically never used the crafting system, but just about did everything I could on my first play through. The exploration quickly became tedious and half of my play time with the ""content"" of this game ended up just being wandering on my horse. The amount of times a boss is repeated is down right egregious in this game. The first time I fought an Ulcerated Tree Spirit it was pretty fun. The 8th time it's just a chore. The open world feels like its extending the game longer than it needs to and is keeping me from enjoying the parts of the game that have substance to it's exploration. I'm mainly referring to the legacy dungeons. Yes those are just like the older games, but I just feel like this is a dark souls game with an empty open world keeping regions apart that would be connected in previous games. As for the story/lore, I'm kind of insulted how much reused themes and ideas are implemented from dark souls. The lore feels like dark souls lore with a different coat of paint. The fact that they heavily marketed the new IP as being a world co created by George R.R Martin and then have it be a re skinned dark souls story is ridiculous. FromSoft has shown multiple times that they can expand on the way they tell their stories and lore with games like Bloodborne and Sekiro so this just seems lazy here.The PVP as of the time of this review is the most unbalanced among all the souls games at release.

It is a shame too because the variety in builds which is one of it's strongest aspects is severely stunted due to this.This may seem like an extremely nit-picky review, but it feels like they are just milking the souls formula in this game. They had evolved their style in Bloodborne and certainly in Sekiro so I shouldn't have to be okay with just playing Dark Souls 3(2) open world edition.",0
Negative,Had recommended this before but now experiencing framedrops. This is the only game I have that does it. I'll change it back once it's been patched.,0
Negative,"They weren't kidding when they said it's not optimized for PC yet. Seems pretty solid in other capacities, but I'm going to let it get some optimizations through and look again.",0
Negative,Initially left a positive review but fuck that. How long are we going to have to put up with piss ports and performance instability on day one for major releases? This shit stutters more than Colin Firth in the King's Speech. FIX IT.,0
Negative,"It's very laggy. I tried it at low settings and at 1080p.I have a 2080, an i7-8700 and 16GB of RAM. It will constantly dip into 30fps and mostly have some sort of lag.No other game is like this for my machine.",0
Negative,"Keyboard and Mouse implementation is atrocious. Releasing something on a PC in that state is just horrible, at least think about it a little and let us fully customize our binds. Accesability is very important to me and Elden Ring is a big negative example sadly.",0
Negative,"(At ~2.7 hours) Received as a gift from a friend, and it's absolutely not my style. It's pretty hard and without much guidance, but seems interesting so far and I haven't even started getting into the story. I can see why people love it, it IS a good game. Just not for me. I'll definitely give it a few more hours to decide if I'll try finishing it.I'm not even 3 hours in (part of it being the tutorial) and I've died *~10x MORE times* than all the very hard / legendary total war campaigns I've quit/lost over the past *2 decades*. E.g.:- I got attacked by the first random soldier I encountered- I tried to sneakily attack some camp, only to get ganged by a dozen soldiers- I fell into some swamp area, and died from the fall. Then tried to retrieve my body but got stuck at the bottom and couldn't figure out if I should go deeper or try to get out, tried the first but kept dying, then decided to leave but got some random OP NPC who was deleting me in seconds (.until I figured I can just run around until another random NPC spawns and kills the first one)- Finally I went fighting some random dead monkey for an hour before I decided to stop for the day. That last one is a good example of what I mean by ""not much guidance"". After somewhere between 5-10 attempts I had improved enough to get a sense of how I'm supposed to fight (run/dodge a certain way first, 1-2 hits at most, repeat until dead) but it just seems tedious to try another 10 times until I nail it. Of course I thought it was the way I'm supposed to go to progress the story, so I googled it. Well, it's not. Turns out folks online say: 1) run past it without fighting, 2) it's towards the 3rd boss (somehow I missed the first two, lol), and 3) you can do it at any level, but 20+ is recommended (/me facepalms not even knowing what I'm doing and being ~10).And I'm still not quite sure I understand how the various actions work, let alone how to combine them efficiently. Sadly, not all of the key binding are visible in the keyboard settings screen (or maybe some are in different places?) for me to double-check, so I'll also need to redo the tutorial.Phew.(Edit at ~9 hours): Still not my kind of game, obviously. Some level grinding, item upgrading, getting more used to the mechanics, and can confidently kill the first tree sentinel with *almost* no damage, and the ""monkey"" (which is actually a troll, and it wasn't towards the ""3rd boss"" but towards the first), and then -less confidently- the first boss (Margit) after ~4-5 attempts and with the help of the summoned sorcerer. Died much less but still plenty. There is some guidance. if you speak to NPCs multiple times since they don't explain everything on the first attempt, but it's not so annoying, in fact I think it's decent. A few annoyances with the UI, and a few with combat (F you, stun-lock!). I'll play a little more, who knows, I might end up actually liking it.(Edit at ~13 hours): Dying less and less, killed a bunch of small bosses (dragon, two rats(?), one more I'm forgetting). Some interactions were buggy. I STILL cannot pick up the mechanics well enough to fight bosses, and even though I'm level 37 I can barely progress towards any direction in the map without finding opponents that destroy me. So I end up needing to farm more and more, which is becoming more and more boring & annoying. The few NPCs I've spoken to haven't helped me much with understanding what the story is about either. And for lots of game systems (e.g. crafting, magic) I probably missed the explanations because I have no idea how to use them. For that I'd need to search online but I'm not doing it for a game I don't even like. Same for build/combat guides. All in all, it's neither a great game nor a terrible one, and definitely not for everyone. That's it for me.(Edit during 2nd attempt, ~35 hours of second playthrough) I decided to give this game a second chance. Well, this game annoys me and I dislike it increasingly more. I take back the ""I see why people like it"", I don't. I progressed quite a lot further (just defeated Morgot) but the game is increasingly frustrating. First, ""difficulty for the sake of difficulty"" is a constant. Annoying UI/UX issues persist. Very lacking explanations about stats and items and how they interact with each other. The story is still bits and pieces all over the place. You are given choices that only ever have 1 positive and 1 negative side (never trade-offs). Random stuff that disrupts your progression through the story. Meh, I don't get how this was voted GOTY.(Edit during 2nd attempt, ~45 hours of second playthrough) Progressed further, killed the Fire Giant after what felt like 100 attempts (and discovering I was ""somewhat under-leveled"" based online consensus), and now I've just reached the Godskin Duo. All my previous points stand. I am truly a masochist, but not enough to keep playing. Don't care for guides or farming either. Too bad, I really wanted to like this and play more, but it's extra hard when I'm not even sure what the story is supposed to be and I keep dying.",0
Negative,"- The sidequests are *terribly* executed. For example, many quests are advanced by chatting with an NPC at several different places, and there is often zero indication where the next place will be. So best case scenario you start the quest early on, then forget about it because there's nothing to go on, and occasionally just 'randomly' earn quest progress as you discover the NPC at future campsites, without any feeling of agency. Worse scenario, you start the quest late after you've already passed through the relevant campsites, and then unless you waste your time teleporting around to the literally hundreds of campsites you've already passed, you might just never find that NPC again without looking up a walkthrough. Even worse case scenario: you progress some quests in the wrong order and SURPRISE the earlier sidequest is now impossible to complete (and there may not even be any indication of that).- The story is hopelessly opaque. I don't know who I am, why I'm fighting, or why this world is so incredibly bleak. I reach some point and it's like ""press Y to rest in the coffin""; I press Y because at the meta-level it's obviously what you're supposed to do next, but why the hell would my character want to do that? Or there's a questline which begins with you helping an NPC escape his prison after he literally tells you that he plans to kill you and defile your corpse. I almost feel like the game is *trying* to make it completely counter to sense, as if to make a point that you can get a gamer to do *anything* as long as it's dressed up as a Quest.- The progression system discourages experimentation. One of the most wonderful things about the game is the extremely rich arsenal of weapons and spells. But a lot of the value in this is lost since experimenting with different loadouts is quite unnecessarily painful: either you have to use the new items ineffectually (i.e. with your current stat distribution which was not optimized for those items, and with the items at +0 upgrade level), in which case of course you won't like them as much as your old loadout, or you can make a fair comparison to your current loadout by respeccing your stats and upgrading the items, but this is not even possible until partway through the game and even then it will cost a shocking amount of resources, and after all that if you don't like the new kit those resources are still gone.",0
Negative,"The game features lots of cool visuals, well scripted AI and impresive animations.And frankly, the game is fine up to a certain point I guess. What I found challenging and interesting in the beginning turned into boring tedium later on. There is this boss early on (Godrick the Grafted after beating him and progressing to the next area the game becomes much much worse in terms of level design.All bosses before, including him, have checkpoints in front of them. It takes quite a few retries to learn their patterns but a least you get to retry the fight within half a minute tops. Where it all goes wrong later on is the amount of time spent traveling from these checkpoints. It can take several minutes to retry most of the boses later on.Is it difficult? Yes.Is it challenging? Only my patience.Is it fun? It turns from really fun to super boring very quickly.Now, it should be mentioned that some of these bosses have hidden checkpoints that are closer to them, but metagaming to find them online or spending hours searching blindfolded only to find nothing useful is not my idea of fun. Also, there are bosses who, despite having checkpoints close to them, have minions respawning on your way to them every time you wish to retry, costing you precious minutes.Those who've played the game up to the boss I was talking about within 15h of playtime can tell that I've progressed at a solid pace. That pace quicky deteriorated because of a major shift in level design. I sincerely doubt they'll fix it. The reason I'm warning others is that after investing more than a dozen hours into progressing my character the game traps you in what is known as the ""sunk cost falacy"". I'd recommend the game at a major discount though. Let's say, at a 15-20 euro pricetag.",0
Negative,"The problem with having a binary review system is that there is little opportunity for nuance. I think Elden Ring is a 'solidly O.K' game that just wasn't up to par with some of the other titles by the same developer - or genre as a whole.Let me preface this review by saying that I completed the game with the 'stars ending', all major bosses (including secret/optional bosses), and + minor bosses (boss duplicates of that of Night's Cavalry not withstanding).Elden Ring is an ambitious attempt at an open-world that, in my opinion misses it's mark. It is the definition of 'one step forward, and two steps back'. To begin with the positives, I love that they included some of the free-form movement from Sekiro. Proper jumping, sneaking, and the new combat techniques associated with that is fantastic. I also feel like they've managed to bring some of the traditionally weaker build paths up to speed, allowing for more ""proper"" diversity in character direction.However, that was where the positives ended for me. To start at the major new feature being the open world. It's an ambitious undertaking, and a fair first attempt at it. Something I noticed during my playthrough was that the initial ""wow this world is huge"" feeling quickly disappeared. The pretty thing in the horizon would usually end up being the linear segment of that area (Stormveil Castle, Raya Lucaria, Mohgwyn Dynasty etc.) with most of the rest of the locations being repetitive rehashed tunnels and boss fights.The first part I can excuse - heck, it might even be good design as it nudges players in a clear direction without being overt. However, the repetitive nature of bosses quickly became stale leaving the majority of the boss fights outside of the primary segments quick and boring. There's also the fact that many of the bosses did not seem to interact well with the world they live in. Bigger bosses like the numerous dragons found throughout the world would often despawn or bug into a tree leaving them stationary while I could just mash away at them like a glorified pi ata. Many of the smaller bosses would interact weirdly with the environment often leading to strange hitboxes and attacks that felt counter-intuitive or unsatisfying. Add to that the fact that you fight some bosses like Night's Cavalry Tree Sentinels upwards of 5-9 times throughout the game and you just get this horrid repetitive grey soup unnaturally prolonging your playtime without adding much. It's a wall that you gotta get through - it's not hard or fun, it just is.There's also the fact that most of the bosses felt relatively uninspired. The main draw in soulsborne games (for me personally, mind you) was the difficult bosses and the heart-pounding action of being pummeled while trying to figure out how to get past a boss mechanic. Elden Ring never gave me that feeling - other than the final boss found during the optional Haligtree area.Another problem I personally found in Elden Ring was the crafting system. It's a novel idea, and I can see the potential benefit of *why* they introduced it. However, I never really found any particular use of the crafting system outside crafting of Preserving Boluses for traversing one particular rotting lake which caused scarlet rot. On the contrary, I felt that the crafting materials actively took the fun out of exploring the open world. Usually in Soulsborne games, seeing and item would mean a jackpot of some sort. You would be on the lookout for items and pathways because you *knew* it would result in a macguffin that would award lore, better stats or alternative build paths for NG+. The crafting materials of Elden Ring diminished this factor tremendously for me, causing me to ignore most of everything in the latter half of the game, only ever acting if the glow was orange.TL:DR; Elden Ring is an ambitious undertaking that ever-so-slightly misses it's mark on all fronts. It plays with interesting concepts but never really do any of them well, leaving everything feeling a bit stale.",0

Negative,"Inapropied activity , wont go online , i just play pve , never used any anything , good job Miobitch!",0
Negative,"Let me get this straight. It isn't a bad game at all. But for being a souls like it doesn't feel great in my eyes. There's alot of things the game does right, but one of the biggest issues to me is the open world system they have. It's massive, but it's also full of copy pasted content. You see one ruin you've seen them all, you've seen one church and you've seen all. There's constantly re-used bosses from other dungeones and they even re-used a main boss as a random encounter. (Not talking about big stick man.)I would be completely fine with the game world being alot smaller, and having fewer things to explore. But more of them were unique. There's some more issues with it that i personally like the horse you get early on lets you cheese a big part of the game and the bonfires pointing exactly where you should go next but i feel like this is a fine ending point.The game isn't bad, but it feels hollow.And for the record, i'm holding the standard alot higher here because it's From Soft. If it was pretty much any other studio i would have sung their praises. But i know the amazing heights this studio can reach.",0
Negative,"Really hate doing this, but I requested a refund. It feels like another attempt to tack the gameloop of a single player game onto a typical grindy mmo. All the mystery and aesthetics of Dark Souls has been replaced with a bright and shiny mmo. Gather trash and craft stuff, grind levels. If you get overwhelmed just run away theres no consequences. The art looks significantly worse than any previous dark souls game. It feels.generic. Additionally the PC port stutters constantly and does not support widescreen, so theres no real reason to play this is on PC. You might as well get the PS5/Xbox version if you have that option.",0
Negative,"never thought id post a bad review about a fromsoft gamewhat is GOODthe world is massive, the environments are well crafted and look greatcharacters and subquest storylines are on average the best of any of the souls games.soundtrack is greateasily over 100 hours of play content. this does not include spending time cooping, pvping, or replaying on ng cycles. if you take your time exploring everything and finding all the caves and ruins and doing all of the side quests you are going to be pushing towards 200 hours.the weapon art/infusion system is great and really allows for some fun and flexible build optionsmagic is more overpowered than it has ever been in any souls game. take every broken spell and tactic from every previous title combine them all, and then multiply that by 10^10what is BADmagic is more overpowered than it has ever been in any souls game. take every broken spell and tactic from every previous title combine them all, and then multiply that by 10^10most of the side dungeons are just the same tiles arranged in a slightly different way, gets very samey.worse port than dark souls 1, which required mods to get more than 10 fps for many people. stability issues. input delay/registration issues especially on horse. frame dips. crashes.netcode is trash and players frequently cant stay connected for more than a couple minutes at most.no steam integration, you cannot see recent players you have met. no more adding great cooperators or duelers to play more. no more blocking lagswitchers and ce users from invading again. why?generally the combat is awful. the game is almost entirely about the combat. and its awful.worst hitboxing of any souls game. many of the new enemy types have flail and grab attacks that just go everywhere. thrusting attacks have somehow gotten even worse. the one exception are the lions, whoever made those did the best work in the whole game.a number of enemies and bosses feel as though their attacks treat you as having a smaller iframe window on rolls, a sort of reverse carthus blood ring effect. could be related to bad hitboxing but feels incredibly cheap and garbage either way.incredibly lazy enemy design. there are only a couple dozen differnt enemy types in total. the same rats, dogs, soldiers, demihumans, plants, and more appear in every single area of the game with virtually no changes other than adding digits to their stat lines. hope you like 2k+ hp rats.this extends to most bosses in the game. outside of the shard bearer bosses, pretty much all of them just keep getting recycled over and over again dozens of times.many enemies are a boring chore to fight, plants especially. that have incredibly slow, long lasting, wide area attacks that mean you are sat there twiddling your thumbs waiting for them to end. others chain spam grab attacks or flailing attacks.sure you can run around most of them and simply not engage. but then that means you are actively skipping content in the game, because its such bad content that you dont even want to play it.most instances where your character gets knocked down/ragdolled now no longer give you grace iframes to prevent you defacto dying in one hit via not being able to control your character. there is a reason it was not done in previous souls games. this isnt challenging. its not good design. and its not fun. its the game dev equivalent of unplugging your younger brothers controller and punching him to ko in street fighter.somehow they broke the lock on system. it is a commonplace occurrence for attacks to just outright miss a stationary unaware target in open terrain with lock on. how? i genuinely dont understand how they broke the lock on so bad.most player attacks have little if any horizontal tracking, while most enemies in the game have very animated movesets. result is that attacks that easily should hit will miss for no reason other than the lock on system prevents it. sure you can free aim, but then why are we given a lock on system? its never been perfect but all previous titles it was at least functional on a basic level, now its not.the lock on camera is bad on a level that exceeds dark souls 2 last giant. its not just an issue of bad lock on points. the camera even locked onto the leg of a ""troll,"" or really any of the large enemies, attemps to twist the camera to his upper body while also turning sideways which causes all manner of fuckery with attacks and dodging.horse combat and jump attacks are hot garbage. but fights got balanced with their use in mind. so you are forced to use unpolished highly flawed systems. more annoying than fun.flying enemies are absolutely horrible.the cool spirit summons are disallowed in many places where you can still summon coop phantoms. way to take your cool new feature and make it even more of an inferior option to summoning a player, not that most players can stay connected to each other for more than a couple minutes.pvp balance is a complete disaster, with more exploits and cheeses than even ds1. tranquil walk of grief tumble buff aint got shit on aoe auto death curse buildup that you just spam roll around with. status procs dont apply half the time.owing to the general balance and speed of pvp combat, fighting multiple opponents, ie invasions, is even less viable than in ds3. beating morons is one thing, ive seen people with 600 max hp in farum azula. but beating a duo or trio of decently competent players without some kind of exploit cheese or otherwise op strat is not likely to happen. even the aoe death curse exploit does not guarantee a victory against two people who know what they are doing.the spawn logic for red/blue invades is absolute garbage.eac is functioning like a rootkit virus, causing most if not all the stability issues, and is doing nothing to stop the cheat engine script kiddies. and of course the cheaters can still inject invalid items directly into your inventory to get you banned. modders blocked this in previous games, fromsoft still hasnt figured it out somehow.eac is worthless, literally a high profile sticker. there are FREE mods made by one or two people in their spare time that do more to stop hackers in souls games than anything fromsoft or eac has ever done.so the game stability is the worst its ever been, the combat is the worst its ever been, the pvp is the worst its ever been, the enemy variety is the worst its ever been, the enemy moveset design is the worst its ever been, and the cheating is about the same as it has always been.support has been nonexistent. 3 weeks out from launch there has been no real bug fixing, no stability improvements, and none of the exploits have been addressed.is it worth buying? no. on sale maybe. it is easily the worst title in the lineup. dont buy it expecting the polish that a souls game should have. dont expect fair or fun combat. dont expect fun pvp. dont expect to be able to coop. expect to have a lot of cheap shitty deaths that are beyond your control. expect to fight the same generic uninspired enemies and bosses over and over again.",0
Negative,0/10 Tyler Taketani got the Blackflame Monk Greaves and Hood before I did,0
Negative,"I want to like this game, I really do. However there's a few flaws that I personally find very annoying if just bad. So I can only like this game, for give or take the first 60 hours of play and pure explore.Despite the frame hiccups, crashing and frankly. boring stuff. Its a good game, but I would say only from the start to mid-late game. The later parts of the game, those are bad. The amount of enemies that are recycled to just be stronger, harder hitting or bosses that have been turned into nothing but the next mob is rather disappointing. I can understand it for some mobs sure, but others it just seems off.Some bosses are nigh-immune to some damage types you do, bleed is effective against just about anything that isn't stone and might as well cheese every fight with it. And if not bleed, frost works just as well.Magic well. Its more or less busted unless done wrong, both against players and bosses. Does it make one a glass-cannon? Yes, but if you can just finish off a boss within the next 10 seconds with a single spell or maybe three, it takes one out of it. Flying enemies are a pain for melee users, especially early on when one has very little knives or such against them. So it feels like one almost should find a bow quickly at times, which some people don't want to spec their build into. Faith is useful sure, but it will be useless against some enemies, magic hurts everything and everywhere, aside from one area really. So what to go for? More or less anything works. Its just that bleed/frost will overshadow just about anything in melee and Magic just murders after a bit of building and certain spells. And one will find that out fast.Sound, world, graphics are really good. Weapons and all have good feedback just like the previous games of From software. Movement is. Good, if one flaw. It remembers the inputs one does at times so if one panics, which one will do. So one roll becomes two and you get hit, its something that I mind more on a personal level, especially since it will mean a lot of your deaths to panic inputs. So on that note, is rolling good? Yep, against players its still amazing, but just about Every enemy has a roll catch, which means that panic rolling, which is good against players works. But panic rolling against bosses will just get you killed, so your mindset will be different on those which can be a little frustrating. Not to mention your horse which works fine, but can't turn on spot which makes sense. Yet if you want to get off of it, you can sometimes get pushed off of Torrent the wrong way and fall to your death.Leveling works fine, stamina is fine along with the health pool. Until late game, where basic enemies just hit one with a sword that appears to have the weight of a house. So even with high defensive gear and high hp, the average mob just hurts. Hurts massively. Makes sense? A little bit, if it makes one feel that going pure damage, non-bleed/frost is a bit of a handicap.So you will likely respec your character, once or twice.Without spoilers, I can recommend this game to anyone who liked the other Fromsoft games, just don't expect to run through the game without a few annoyances here and there. As overall, its still a good game. Just with flaws, its Not Perfect. Sometimes a little lazy. Everything else holds it together well like the world and combat. Just not in the end-game in my book.Spoilers ahead.The Red Wolf in the Academy, Commander O'Neil, The Ancestral Spirit, Magma Wyrm. These four are bosses, which get re-used either as mob or an upgraded boss. Its upsetting, it makes these bosses feel like a joke or fraud, these are but a few of many in the game. It feels a little lazy. I know making enemies that are engaging is difficult, but at least try to hide it a little bit.The physick for a custom healing/buff item is fine, except it can basically make magic busted if done right even against higher end bosses. It makes a build more interesting and it can help in a fight or invasion if one knows what to do. Since you have to work to find the buffs that you need.Faith, it works. Is it anywhere near as busted in damage as Intelligence magic? No. I do get it, as Faith is usually a healer/buff kind of thing. And their buffs are great, along with the heals. If allowed time. But as this is spoil territory, the final boss does NOT care about holy damage. It has a 75%(?) resistance to it. Meaning that final boss will just be nigh-unkillable for said build, making them have to farm/respec Entirely just for the very final boss, only to possibly spec back because it was their personal build that worked everywhere else.So health almost seems useless at times with the damage enemies do, almost as if telling one to just grab a shield and stay behind it. Assuming they don't break your stamina bar almost instantly.Call me bad, as I won't consider myself a pro. But I also very much enjoy making builds that work well enough despite not being meta. Yet if everything a bit meta (at the moment) just defeats it without even much of a hint of effort feels painful to one's ideas for builds.Like I stated beforehand, the game is good, its enjoyable for a long while. Some bosses may be frustrating as is normal with Fromsoft, yet if bosses get recycled like your next limited edition game suddenly coming out next week to be not-so limited is what that feels like. Lazy if not annoying.And thats what the end-game feels like to me. If my 25+ Nightrider Glaive has to attack a late-basic mob for over 15 times it makes it feel weak. While a 25+ Uchigatana can kill same late-basic mob in 5 hits because of bleed? It feels a bit wrong, I'd be more scared personally of a huge glaive then a folded sword. The last few bosses are fine to some degree, the final-final one is in my book just boring as its a cat & mouse fight. But overall, end-game feels more like a hassle and pain than fun.So with all that said, do I like the game? Yes, but only for the first half. The latter half I just slowly die down more and more with my excitement as enemies just become walking tanks, my weapons that aren't bleed/frost feel weak and magic is just seemingly too strong with some bit of building. Faith only feels good in some ways and tanking. Well, you'd better invest in stamina and a good shield instead of health. The bosses can just one-combo you if you panic roll, which one will more often then not do if remembering your inputs for said rolls. Because it just feels more and more lazy the further one goes. Which is a big shame.And thats what I feel and think about this game, the end. Is just a shame.",0

Negative,"Be in year 2022, be one of the most respected developers of the last 2 decades, make the decision to keep releasing games on PC without the following:- Ultrawide support.- The ability to turn off v-sync.- Unlocked framerates.- Proper button prompt icons for keyboard and mouse.Those are all things that every other game, including indie games, gets right these days.Add to that we now have arguably one of the worst, most invasive anti-cheats available in the form of Easy Anti-Cheat, and as such we likely can't even mod the game to support ultrawide or disable vsync without getting banned.Then yet on top of that the performance day 1 is all over the place for people, with many on high-end hardware reporting massive issues with frame drops, stuttering, low framerates, and even crashing.Bravo, my time to refund is coming. C'mon FromSoft, get with the times. Half-Life 2 supported ultrawide, in 2004. Every game you've released on PC until now has had people yelling about these issues and eventually modding the games to fix them, doing your work for you.It hits harder than most because I know the rest of the game is quality, but I cannot recommend against it any harder based on it being a bad port of a great game, which makes it doubly frustrating.Update: After contacting support, they stated ""we cannot comment on the lack of ultrawide support"". The developers haven't even acknowledged the users, people have also found out that the game actually DOES render in ultrawide and superultrawide, but the developers actually went out of their way to render additional black boxes over that additional screenspace. On top of that, the developers actually locked the framerate for no good reason, as it's been unlocked in offline mode without any consequences and the game actually runs better. My suspicion is that they didn't want the PC to be ""superior"" to console, so they kneecapped it on purpose. Same goes for the vsync toggle, another feature they went out of their way to kneecap.",0
Negative,"I'm glad other people are enjoying this game and the DLC. It's not for me.I did the mash-my-face-into-the-boss thing, figured I was underleveled and explored everywhere I could. I went back to the boss and eventually won, but I didn't feel good about it; annoyed, actually. Dodging the one or two hits that could send me back to the walk of shame doesn't feel good to me when life limits my time to learn the cues. ""Playing it like an RPG,"" doesn't feel good to me when I still have to face the boss anyway and there isn't a major change in power dynamic between us. Exploring doesn't feel good to me when I'm out of world to explore and hit the point of minimum returns while farming.I might watch other people stream just to be a part of their joy, but this isn't for me anymore.",0

The game is amazing don't get me wrong. The boss design of this game is just the worst I've ever seen. Repeat bosses everywhere, nearly all bosses are huge, huge bosses with terrible camera so it's hard to see moves as melee. I could go on and on about how you are forced to change your play style to be a glass cannon and have the skill of dark souls speed runners. It's just dumb",0

Negative,"I dare say this game is overrated.- Difficulty is not determined as much by skill as much as it is by your enemies' numbers being bigger than yours. I'm not saying there's NO skill, but I'm also not saying the game will demand your skill any more than it will demand your patience.- It was made at the stage of FromSoft's lifecycle where difficulty and dying a lot is the only thing that matters because Miyazaki gets $10 for every time a game journalist says ""[insert game here] Is the Dark Souls of [insert genre here]"", and it definitely shows.- 90% of the game's bosses are fought the exact same way; They get close and rush you down while you roll around and maybe hit them once, twice if you're lucky before you go right back to Fred Durst'ing it until the boss's meter hits zero. Plus, the bosses who actually have unique gimmicks like Rykard and Radahn overstay their welcome long after you've figured them out. My favorite bosses in the game are Morgott and Hoarah Loux, but the fights themselves aren't cool, just the CONTEXT of them is cool (more on this later). I consider this to be a failure for the game; for its defining trait to be the least interesting part of itself.- Despite the presence of a Souls-style leveling system, most enemies can kill you just by acknowledging your existence. And before some wise guy comes to this review and says ""bUt vIgOr"", it doesn't matter if your vigor is 17 or 70. There are enemies that will flatten you like a steamroller no matter how big your meter is, and the only time you will ever notice any difference with your stats against the area's enemies is when you come back to an area that hasn't been your problem for three weeks. What if you were using the soreseals though? They re good but maybe they were getting you killed I never used the soreseals, since magic isn t my primary source of damage. The closest thing I ve had to a self-inflicted debuff was Fia s blessing.- The open world is a joke. All it fundamentally is is just Dark Souls with buffer zones that take a long time to cross. So basically you spend $60 on Dark Souls 3 with even more filler. There's nothing to do in the open world, and the closest thing there is to ""something to do"" is the mines and the catacombs which, if anyone has ever played Bloodborne, are fundamentally Chalice Dungeons, with no unique bosses, in dungeons that can't be randomized, with your reward being some Enemy Spirit Ash you'll never summon, or a trinket you could get in bulk anywhere else. On top of this, Torrent changes nothing. He only exists to justify having these buffer zones in the first place. Does he change the pace of the boss fights? Sometimes. Does he ever change the pace of UNIQUE or ESSENTIAL boss fights? No. There are too many places where this ""staple of Elden Ring"" can't be used, and there are even more places and events that could have been made better by his presence, such as during the final boss fight, which alone was terrible from a design standpoint because of how out-of-nowhere and chaotic it is. You can't even summon him during multiplayer, or while a Spirit Ash is active.- To go over some story issues, we need to understand what makes storytelling work. ""Show, don't tell"" is the golden rule of storytelling. What happens in Elden Ring is that the most interesting parts of the lore are notes you read in some random article of gear, and 90% of it has nothing to do with how you play. For example, the name ""St. Trina"" has no relevance to you, the player, than to tell you what items are related to the Sleep ailment, but it shows up in the written lore as frequently as trees in a forest. Another example involves Mohg, a boss who has the power of ""Blood Fire"", bright-red flames that inflict the Bleed ailment. This is said to be done by ""lacerating the body of the Formless Mother"". This info is completely useless because it does not change how this magic works in any way. One may expect blood magic to be cast by using your HP as an alternative for MP, but it simply doesn't. It works like all other magic in the game. As someone who plays FANTASY RPGs to get invested in a FANTASY world, this mundane gameplay with outrageous lore reminds me of working retail, how there's this long eventful story of how a store you work in came to be, but the actual work you do asks nothing of you but your ability to listen, follow directions, and put up with the bullshit that comes with it. Dung Eater is supposed to be scary because people tell you he's scary. Rykard is supposed to be evil because people tell you he's evil. Marika is supposed to be great because people tell you she's great. Godrick is supposed to be a worthless failure because people tell you he's a worthless failure. There are way too few moments where the story or personality of a character is SHOWN, and not TOLD. To give an example of GOOD storytelling in a Souls game, look at Solaire from Dark Souls. He's a knight who governs a self-founded guild that believes brilliance is achieved by aiding others. This is expressed by Solaire's summon sign appearing the most frequently out of every NPC in the whole game. The only character to ever have this potential is Melina, and she doesn't even do it with the correct boss because of dumb plot reasons. Hoarah Loux? Radagon? Elden Beast? Nope. She shows up for ONE boss; Morgott, who's basically just there to guard a door he doesn't even have the key to. After that, the story writes itself in such a way that prevents her from ever doing this again, despite her only gimmick allegedly being LITERALLY FOLLOWING YOU EVERYWHERE.- Compared to past games, multiplayer is even more pathetic here than it ever was before. To understand why, let's review some of the basic multiplayer rules established by past games. All Souls games before this one have had 'alive' and 'dead' states. Said states grant certain benefits and caveats. They also dictate what is possible in terms of multiplayer action. In Demon's Souls, players had to be in their dead form to enter other peoples' worlds, while players in their alive forms can be found by said dead-form players. This rule was much the same in Dark Souls, though it removed the hassle of having to be dead to cast a co-op sign.In both games, being alive granted players host privileges as well as occasional HP buffs, depending on the game, but at the cost of unconditional vulnerability to invaders. In Elden Ring, for no reason at all, the two functions of the games' resurrection charms have been split up into separate items, which completely removes the stakes of granting yourself a substantial buff.- Speaking of low-stakes multiplayer, invaders previously appeared in past games to play the role of the enemy, which is remarkable for a ROLE PLAYING GAME, for players to present as much a threat to each other as the rest of the game. However, in Elden Ring, these ""invaders"" need the host's permission to invade them. In regular gameplay, without an item called the Taunter's Tongue, it takes the presence of a friendly phantom to make invasion reception possible, which already stacks the odds against the invading party. Couple that with a competitive community that has no qualms with over-optimizing the fun out of the game, and you'd be lucky to invade a single world without getting annihilated in a nanosecond by solar flares, weapon pairs tuned to inflict Bleed nearly instantly, decay-inducing fog, and mega-lasers. That's no exaggeration.There probably were or are good qualities of the game, but after having spent as much time on it as I have, and after beating the game MONTHS AHEAD OF MY FRIENDS WHO ACTUALLY LIKE IT, I am just sick of this game and everything to do with it. The base game has inspired too little faith in the DLC to ever consider coming back. If you STILL want to blast $60 on this game, all I can say is that you brought ALL of the ensuing frustration upon yourself.",0

The game is not properly offloading visual assets to the GPU, despite the fact that I've set the configuration to force high performance GPU usage only, in both windows and the GPU control plane.

Negative,"The PvP in this game is even more toxic than in previous Soulsbourne titles. This is somewhat surprising given that you won't even be PvP invaded in this game if you play solo, but when you're just looking forward to playing PvE content with friends and don't want to PvP, being forced into it against players that specifically know what they're doing is an awful experience. I do not feel joy when I win. I only feel anger that I had to deal with it at all. I highly recommend not playing this if you wanna have a positive coop experience with friends. This is compounded by a toxic PvP community whose general response to this is ""waah, get over it,"" and want to have their fun ganking and harming the fun others are trying to have. If you're all about PvP, that's great. You absolutely should be able to PvP with others that are, too. Forcing it on people in a game that is built upon high stress situations is just bad design. It's almost a shame the games are otherwise so good - because they sell so much regardless, there's no need to ever change this approach.If you just plan to play solo, then it's quite good. Some kinks here and there, less polished than previous From Soft titles, but they have been around for a long time and received updates over time to become what they did later. This is the first Souls game I've ever played at launch on PC, and I'm given to understand they're always less than perfect. Some balancing issues are still being addressed, so my review might change, but my recommendation of it is EXTREMELY conditional. Wanna play coop and don't mind PvP, or wanna play solo? It's a fine game, but better experienced on console. Wanna coop with friends but don't want to be forced to get invaded by someone spamming the same super fast ability that does multiple status debuffs really fast? Do NOT play this.",0
Negative,"For PC users, this has been a terrible experience.I tried to figure out all the ways to get this game to run without running into major bugs that made it unplayable. The main one, entire screen is black and won't render in most of the open world. Background processes on my computers are not major, already made sure that it is not my own thresholds that i'm surpassing on my PC, this is a problem with the game as I am nowhere near making my GPU / PC ""run hot"". Pretty bummed, really love the lore, but the game right now was unplayable for me, literally. The fact we are weeks into its launch and I can't see anything around me 5 minutes into the game is horrendous. Unlikely I will be looking forward to another game from this company.",0

Negative,"Was looking forward for this game. Sadly my game didnt run properly at all. Stuck on the resolution 800x450 the game was unplayable. Doing some googling I noticed alot of simular threads about the Dark Souls series, with people having issues with the game stuck on 800x450. A real shame, but from the little I saw it looked like the normal poor PC port.1/10 would not try again.",0

Negative,"Many people out here already pointed out a mass amount of problems this game have. Briefly talking - a major step back in comparison with Sekiro. Just sad to see designers making probably the best visuals in the entire gaming industry, only to be filled with poorly executed in-game mechanics updating once in 5 years so the game won't look exactly the same as previous one.Especially in the DLC, where game developers decides to make a firework ventilator out of every major boss there is.",0
Negative,"the stuttering and performance issues are real unfortunately even w/3090, and security exploits are unpatched despite what From Software has promised, so you can only safely play on online mode. wait for a GOTY edition and buy on sale",0
Negative,"Technical issues persist. The game uses perhaps 15% of my GPU on average, maybe 40% CPU, when it could do more and maybe even try reach that hard capped 60 FPS rate. Adjusting graphics settings has very little effect, the difference between medium and maximum is like 10 FPS at most, but there's a wide variety of scenery and it's a big world so where you check for performance obviously matters, but processor usage doesn't. Fortunately I don't suffer as much from the stuttering effects reported by some other players, and most of the time it's a very smooth and pretty experience, but it's obvious there is something wrong under the hood of the game. I guess this is what I deserve for putting my money on console game.Design issues persist as well, mostly as baggage from earlier FromSoftware games. The co-op mode is a joke, and you cannot selectively enable or disable online features like messages, co-op or invasions, it's all or nothing. For some players, especially fans of the studio, this is perfectly acceptable for no real reason. But if any other studio attempted to do this, there'd be backlash, outcry and probably attempts to improve online features before releasing them, or at least an apologizy. I don't understand how FromSoftware gets a free pass with these things, but maybe it tells something how irrelevant most of the online features are in the first place. The situation feeds on itself, which is a shame because I could see myself having a blast in co-op if it was done properly.Moving on, I feel like there's two games here inside Elden Ring which communicate with each other remotely but fluidly. You can (and often must) travel open world and farm runes and stones to level up your character and gear in order to progress through the more linear, erm, ""storyline"". The problem is that farming and grinding we have all seen in most other open world games (and others), and the practical nonexistence of storyline or characters connected to the story doesn't help motivate getting through it unless you're a staunch believer of FromSoftware religion and ""know"" (believe) there is something from the pen of GRRM himself in there. Although, to be fair, his presence could clearly be felt when I was returning from a quest to deliver a father's response to a girl only to find her murdered on the spot where I met her. Damn, I feel so bonded with the game. So the main problem for me is that I need to find motivation to keep playing the game, because the game itself is so unmotivating thanks to absence of interesting story elements (on the more linear side of the game) and the general unforgivingness, trial-and-error style gameplay afflicting the whole of it.As for general gameplay highlights, in close combat you're stuck with an action queue system which will input your missed dodge after you recover, which prevents you from dodging at right time to avoid follow-up attacks. Amazing. Ranged combat with bow is quite fine, and I hear magic is probably a solid way to go as well, so maybe they are on to something there. Sadly, the stealth system is also a joke, since the enemies have attention span and senses of a goldfish unless scripted otherwise. It's infinitely worse than Skyrim, one of the most stealth-memed games in existence. You can literally walk in a knight's field of view while he's busy railroading to corpse of a guard dog you killed five seconds earlier and he won't see you (NPCs of any type cannot alert their comrades unless they have a horn call). Enemies barely comprehend what line of sight is, often wasting their attacks (which for they have infinite mana and projectiles) on walls and other obstacles, and all the memes about high ground are reality here. There is also little to no dynamic content in the open world from what I've seen so far. It's just the same scripted environment with same NPCs. Your best bet for discovering something that wasn't already there is meeting a strong opponent or quest NPCs in some earlier areas of the game depending on time of day or rarely previous encounter of something else, but you'll have to be lucky or persistent to catch those without foreknowledge because overall there is very little point in revisiting already explored regions. That description goes for everything in the game, in fact, not just exploration. Even Cyberpunk 2077's endlessly repeating crime scenes are more dynamic and engaging events. This all shows that you cannot just put a Soulsborne game inside open world and call it done. It's a damn boring and uninspired world, and the overall excellent encounter design (within the limitations of copypasted enemy types, as is typical to open world ""genre"") and the very appealing but scarce selection of gear and abilities are not enough to save the whole from the repetitiveness.One more example of contradictory moment occurred just today when the most recent patch added map markers for relevant quest and vendor NPCs. Personally, I welcome this feature, but cannot help but wonder if it goes against the rabidly vocalized theme of exploration and discovery that is repeated by the fan base of FromSoftware, especially as the markers seem to be capable of revealing NPCs I have never even seen in the world. But then again, I could be wrong and maybe everything the studio does is automatically golden and should be considered immune to criticisms. But hey, while we're at it, how about some kind of quest log? Or journal? The character is capable of keeping records for many things, just not for quests. I have to say it again, it's amazing how the studio gets away with lack of features or functionality when other studios get immediately split-roasted about it all across the internet. To me, it doesn't seem like the devs are certain what they should have been doing, but the fans sure don't seem to mind that.I might continue to keep playing, even against my best instincts, in desperation to find value for my purchase, and though it may be exactly the right game for some people, at this point I cannot in good faith recommend Elden Ring for PC players. If you're not absolutely sure you like Elden Ring before playing it, don't buy it. Take another look later, when it's on sale, and/or when the technical issues have possibly been solved. Because that's totally what the industry does these days.",0
Negative,"Only time ive enjoyed this game is the feeling you get for a short 3 minutes after you defeat a boss, badly designed game. not deserve goty cool graphics. would rather play a well designed 2000s game than any soulslike. sims 4 better, the escapists 2 better, fall guys better, isis beheading videos more entertaining than this dogshit. bosses are just rinse and repeat, would rather be subjected to 5 hours of waterboarding than play 2 hours straight of this game. good games shouldnt have to be played with guides just sayin",0
Negative,"The game is good, but bare with me for the negative review.As expected from all the infos we had prior to the release this game is a spiritual sequel (and some may call it a direct evolution) from the Dark Souls franchise, and it is in a way. But sadly while the game is vast, with a ton to explore, a lot of weapons, summons, spells to try, it comes with it's great costs.As you know, the game is poorly optimized for pc, they know the issue and they are working on it, actually they did already improve it a bit since release, but fps drops are still to be expected, which can lead to frustrating deaths/hits taken.Another thing that makes me give a negative review is the balancing from late game areas, where the damage you take is just way too high, in my first playthrough I had 55 Vigor, 40 Endurance to equip the heaviest possible armor, full defensive amulets and stuff was still 2-3shotting me, and some moves did oneshot me from full hp, that's just plain bulls*.And about heavy armor, the poise in the game is just a myth, even with the heaviest armor, the first rat from the first ""legacy dungeon"" will still stagger you, no matter how much your ""poise"" stat is, and again, that's bulls*.The damage you deal is weird, some weapon arts are really strong, status effects are really strong and so are jump attacks, but regular attacks just don't feel right, and having played my fair share of other fromsoft games (expecially ds3) I dislike that, since it's by far my favourite approach to the game.There are still the same issue that was in DS3 as well with imput queueing, leading you to getting hit multiple times if you misstime the first roll (basically misstime the first roll, get back on your feet and the roll you pressed before will perform as soon as you are up, leading you to going out of ""tempo"" of the enemy attacks, getting hit one more time). While this isn't the extreme worse thing, they should have adressed this issue since it's been in their games for far too long, and considering the insane amount of damage the enemies does in this game, it's even worse than on his predecessors.One last thing, and probably the reason I decided to write this all, the cheaters are still there, I was playing with a friend and we got invaded by a teleporting, immortal guy, that casted a Supernova (that isn't a spell you can learn, it's a skill from a boss, but this one was 10 times bigger and hit everything on sight for 360k dmg, instakilling everything that was there, even fieldbosses, and the worse part of that was that our GPU went up for like 30 in temperature).How is it possible that if people use an external fix for fps drops and to put the game in ultra-wide they get softbanned and they let people literally frying the GPUs of others run rampart?To conclude, the game is good, imho it isn't as good as DS3, but there are a lot of issues I hope they will address.",0

Negative,"From Software has crafted the ultimate souls-like open world experience.They failed, however, to fulfill their promise of delivering a seamless multiplayer experience.This game is the ultimate refinement of the Dark Souls series. But it is only that, a refinement. It contains nothing new, nothing innovative, and feels more like an extremely good mod for Dark Souls 3.",0
Negative,"I have beaten DS1, 2, and 3, Bloodborne, and Sekiro. This is the first souls game I am leaving a negative review for after completing it. I do not hate this game, I am on the fence about it. The good is VERY good, but the bad definitely soured my enjoyment enough to lean towards recommending older Souls games over this one. To put it simply, there are two games within this game. One that I love dearly, and one that I can't stand. It's just a shame I can't play the one I like without also playing the one I don't.At first, I wasn't too sure how I felt about the open world in a souls game. After I dipped my toes in I started to like it a lot more. However the more I played the more the cracks started to peek through. It didn't feel like the huge world was filled with anything interesting, and honestly served as an enormous hallway between dungeons and traditional linear levels. Exploration is rewarded with consumables and occasionally weapons and armor, however after I got my hands on the weapons and armor I liked, all those items became meaningless and I was just wasting my time exploring.There are also a few NPCs scattered around, but to be honest I didn't really have any kind of meaningful interaction with any of them aside from maybe 2 or 3. The open world is a huge disservice to trying to follow quest lines. Rarely do NPCs tell you where you can find them next, you're just supposed to stumble across them. I loved the feeling of randomly finding them, however I definitely missed a lot of content because I did things in the wrong order or didn't know where someone was going to be. Before beating the final boss, I tried to look in the little corners I may have missed all over the world, and in doing so I found a few people that I missed. All they do is tell you they'll see you later, and then you have the entire map to look for them again. I realize this is how it works in Dark Souls games, however this game is so vast it makes it extremely tiresome to look for them. I don't want objective markers, I just want some communication and at least a direction to look! Many objectives within the game aside from combat are incredibly shallow, and a good portion of them boil down to ""find the needle in the haystack"". You spend so much of this game looking for stuff, and for me it got so tedious and tiresome.I also got really annoyed by the traversal system. After playing some really great open world games in terms of traversal (Horizon: ZD, BOTW, AC: Origins) it's hard to look past the clunky and frustrating design choices in this game. The biggest offender in my opinion is Torrent. The horse has such a hard time standing on things and constantly falls off of slightly sloped surfaces. I have fallen and slipped to my death from so many stupid situations because the horse refused to actually ""land"" where I landed. It has a double jump, but using it at the end of a fall doesn't cancel your momentum, which is incredibly jarring. You are only allowed to traverse cliffs where they WANT you to, which is another way this open world still feels like linear levels in disguise.The amount of times you fight the same enemy again and again is actually kind of insane. You spend the time learning how to fight an enemy, you finally best them in combat, and then later on in the game you get to fight them again but harder! Sure, you've also grown in strength and experience, but that just means you're doing the same thing again. This gave the game a LOT of fat that needed to be trimmed out. If I were to beat this game again, I would have beaten the Magma Wyrm boss a total of around 10 times. I already know how to fight it! It's just tedious work at this point!Another disservice to the open world model is coop. As others have mentioned, the Dark Souls summoning system is so tiresome at this point. Especially when exploring with friends. Oh hey look a dungeon! But we can't go in it due to the fog wall. Everyone has to desummon, travel to that location on their own, and then resummon back in order to complete the dungeon together. Kinda defeats the whole ""no loading screens"" thing. Then you have to complete the dungeon for every player. Summoning one or two players is so time consuming and tedious, especially if you're dealing with a very challenging area. It's insane they haven't thought of a new system that makes it more streamlined than that. It makes playing with a friend a complete slog and you feel bad for wasting someone else's time if you die.You are also not allowed to use many features if you play with a friend. The worst example is you cannot use your horse which blocks off many chunks of the world where a horse is required. If they were concerned about using your horse during invasions, then just disable it for invasions and not coop scenarios?My biggest complaint about balance was fortunately quickly patched. My ash of war was so much stronger than any of my sorceries after fully upgrading my weapons and dumping points into intelligence. It felt like a cop out button I could use at any time. I was happy they made that change. However there were a few things about the balance of the game that I wasn't a fan of. Basically the difficulty seemed to jump ALL around the place. I went from one shotting everything, to being one shot, and back to oneshotting again. A LOT of enemies could be very easily cheesed using level geometry or enemy behavior. That was the most amount of cheese I've experienced in a Souls game so far.A lot of the bosses seemed to work the same. Spam out a million attacks you have to dodge or parry repeatedly, stand still for one or two attacks, rinse and repeat. Then perform a move that will one-shot you, and return to the previous pattern. Some had gimmicks like an unavoidable blood loss mechanic, so that added some variety I guess.I found myself leaving really powerful enemies after dying again and again without getting anywhere, planning to return later after I got some more experience and power. When I returned to those fights I would often defeat them in a few seconds. It was so hard to gauge my own power level compared to everyone else, and it rarely felt like a fair fight one way or the other.I had a few bugs that were seriously frustrating, and several crashes that of course came with warnings to stop ""quitting"" my game or I would get banned. The most notable bug that happened to me the most often was my character would randomly get suspended in place as if I was falling infinitely. I couldn't do anything to get out of it, and the falling timer would eventually automatically kill me. I have no idea why this happened. There were also a few areas where I would constantly run into connection errors after a few minutes while playing with a friend. It only happened in specific areas in-game.Overall there was a game in Elden Ring that I really enjoyed. It was just buried under some really frustrating and tedious mechanics that I feel like they were just too afraid to rework in fear of appearing less hardcore. It seems that they may have been a bit too ambitious for the size of the map considering the amount of copy/pasted content they filled it with. This game exceeded my expectations in a lot of places, but disappointed me in ways I didn't anticipate.",0

Negative,"Have you ever wondered what it would be like to fight a Bloodborne/Sekiro boss in Dark Souls 3, with mechanics very clearly not intended for a stat-heavy game? Wonder no more! Now you, too, can experience the misery of poorly designed bosses and Dark Souls 3's overtuned gameplay, now for a whopping 60+ hours!

Don't forget my personal favorite, ""explore an area to defeat a clone of a boss you fought 10 hours ago, then teleport to a different area to fight a clone of a DIFFERENT boss you fought 8 hours ago, so that you can progress to fight a clone of ANOTHER boss you fought 5 hours ago""!",0
Negative,First off I am recommending the game to those who love the soul series I am just voicing concerns I would like to see fixed. If you are thinking about purchasing this game be prepared for a lot of grinding to get strong enough to beat anyone because there are so many optional smaller bosses. Now to the matter at hand I have found that multiplayer is a little hit and miss you can get disconnected for no reason even with a strong internet connection. If you play on PC and have a wide screen monitor the game will not support it so you are left with two blacked out screen panels since it only supports a 16:9 aspect ratio so that takes away from the immersive feel of this beautiful game. Lastly i'm sure this is from the latest update causing bugs but my friend and I were fighting Rennala and when we got to the second stage in the moon realm we were invaded by another player making it impossible for us to beat either of them. I hope these issues can be solved soon however i will say this is the most stunning game derived from the dark souls series and I look forward to seeing future DLCs. Thank you for your time and Praise The SUN,0
Negative,"To this day I cannot play this game properly because of the shader compilation issues. It's not a fault with my PC's performance as a mod that fixes this issue makes the game run flawlessly, but it can't be used online meaning no funny messages or invasions. It's been two years.",0
Negative,"For now, no - I cannot recommend a game that puts so much emphasis on fluid combat, yet frequently stutters and freezes.

Negative,At this moment I would not recommend this game. I have two hours in the game so far one of those hours was creating a character and the other trying to fix the frame rate and absolutely horrible graphics.

I end up getting kicked cause the frame rate isn't suitable for online play so it say's.,0
Negative,Not worth it. The open world aspect adds nothing to the game other than extra grind. You are expected to grind random open world mobs in order to progress the story because the story bosses are incredibly overtuned. Elden Ring is a complete downgrade to the souls series in every way.

But in my opinion it was rewarding to finally beat those spots.If you happen to be at a spot you die often in this game, or it is just difficult for you, why bother? Just ride somewhere else.

Negative,"TL;DR: excellent ideas, terribly balanced. Probably still worth checking out, at least until the lategame when it becomes ridiculous.I have. mixed feelings about this game.The world is absolutely gorgeous with plenty to explore and find, the ash of war/affinity customization is amazing and there are lots of interesting weapons and casting abilities. Horseback combat is also great, though the controls are a bit weird sometimes.I really, really want to love this game but in its current state I just can't.I'm not new to the genre, I finished both Dark Souls 1 and 3 several times (and about to wrap up a SL1 save, just to say I'm not a complete casual). I absolutely adored them, so I thought this would be the same, especially with how everyone kept saying how great it was.Oh lord.The first half of the game flows very well- merrily running around and exploring every nook and cranny of a well-crafted open world, enemies are many and tough sometimes but that's expected and part of the fun. Limgrave, Weeping Peninsula and Liurnia are fairly easy to be honest.Past those first few areas and into the mid-game, suddenly the world starts really hating you, and you're basically forced to put 35-40 points in vigor unless you're an invulnerable roll god, because everything can and will one-shot you. But ok, fair enough, it's Fromsoft, enemies have always hit like a truck before so it's not a shock, just slightly harder than usual. Navigating through areas is perfectly doable and sneaking around can be fun too- until you reach the boss.So apparently this game really wants melee only players dead. I'm not even a colossal two-hander but a filthy dex user, so fairly fast in theory, but the problem is still there- you basically have to watch whatever boss you're fighting chain a 20 piece combo while running and dodging for your life, only to hit them a single time or twice at most (yes, even with a fast weapon) barely chipping their planet-sized health bar, then repeat.This wouldn't be a problem either, if only basically every boss didn't spam one stance breaking and/or one shotting AOE attack after the other, some completely unavoidable unless you possess divine positioning abilities and reflexes or are blessed with infinite luck.Some bosses have barely any recovery time between attacks and no timers for some abilities (looking at you, Malenia, and that 5x waterfowl you pulled on me) and it's absolute hell to navigate all these AOEs while still having the time and mental fortitude to land a hit or two sometimes.If that wasn't enough, there's this stupid mechanic where if you try to roll while you get hit, the roll doesn't get cancelled but starts right after you've recovered. right on time to be hit again.It could be a me problem- I might not have enough DPS and therefore drag the fight on too much, and RNG has never been on my side either. But if the alternative is cheesing almost every boss through broken weapons or doing a respec to spam comet azur or rot breath, then I don't know. That doesn't sound very fun, but what I've been doing hasn't been very fun either.Minibosses aren't that great either, a lot are gank fights or enemies with ridiculous AOEs constrained inside tiny arenas that don't even allow you to run out of range. Ooor they're just straight up unfun to fight, like runebears, or royal revenants if you forget to bring a catalyst to spam healing spells.Some bosses are cool though, like Rykard. Rykard is awesome, and the bossfight is glorious. Morgott was awesome too, even Hoarah and Radahn.So, while I'm not saying that the game is bad, it still feels really unbalanced as it is and causes enough frustration to ruin the celebrative moment after a boss finally dies.So yeah, know what you're getting into, especially if you're kinda bad like me or you want to go full melee.The devs have fixed balancing issues very quickly before and did a good job fixing performance issues too, so who knows, I might change this review into a positive one someday. Hopefully.(I also fought Radahn pre-nerf and believe me- he's not the one that needed rebalancing the most).Good luck, Tarnished.EDIT: I just went back to my level 1 DS3 save I'd originally put on hold because SoC was way too hard. Guess who first tried him after coming back from Elden Ring because this time around he felt way too easy.That's right folks: Dark Souls 3's *final boss* feels more fair and balanced at level 1 than most of Elden Ring's lategame content at level 120.Great.",0
Negative,"Elden Ring is a strange and fabulous addition to the Dark Souls series. While I was at first shocked by how similar the game is to FromSoft s previous medieval-themed titles, I quickly settled in to a sprawling adventure laden with surprises and glorious freedom. The new recurring enemy types, like the living jars, empty bowled giants, and the large domed Cuckoo mages, pleased me immensely. I loved fighting armored mounted enemies, though there are far too few of them, though I must admit that the dragon encounters that litter the landscape were too easy for my draconic tastes. I want my dragons impervious and deadly! The landscapes, of course, are beautiful. Caelid, with its rotting pink flora and blood sky, is probably my favorite region in a Dark Souls game to date, and I loved even more that I could explore these areas by my own will. Dark Souls 1 finally has a proper sequel in Elden Ring exploration is open and nonlinear, and the secret passages, sequence breaks, and skips are as arcane as they ve ever been. While the open world can sometimes feel directionless or empty, the sense of travel invoked by approaching a distant tower on horseback more than makes up for these occasional doldrums.Unless you want to play multiplayer coop with a friend.You see, after my first playthrough I was amped to start a brand new run with a friend of mine. We picked out starting gear, planned some builds, and, after a bit of item muling shenanigans, were eventually ready to set off on a fresh tramp through Middle Earth AHEM The Lands Between. Once we figured out how to make the special item required for summoning, we set right to work exploring Limgrave anew. We decided to hit the mines first for some crafting materials, and FOG WALL.[If Steam let me upload pictures with reviews, I would include a picture of me and my friend standing in front of an impassible wall of fog preventing us from exploring a mine together]As you can see, not much has changed since Dark Souls 1. During multiplayer sessions in older games, fog walls would pop up to keep the play area fairly limited. I assume the primary reason for this is rendering you couldn t just keep the entire map loaded for multiple players to travel in opposing directions in! Especially in a PS3 game. The MP fog walls could be annoying in early areas of the game due to their greater interconnected-ness, but in dungeons it became pretty much unnoticeable. In Dark Souls 3 it was not much of an issue at all because each zone was usually a massive, sprawling area. And frankly, these limitations made sense in games not specifically marketed as massive open world experiences. DS titles before Elden Ring were corridor crawlers even the largest areas in Dark Souls 3 were broken into linear albeit vertically overlapping paths between bonfires. Elden Ring, however, is a modern open world experience, but the Dark Souls multiplayer system has not been adjusted at all to fit the new paradigm.So, how do you explore the Limgrave mine with your friend? Well, first you have to disconnect from him. Doing this sends you back to wherever you were before being summoned., which could be very far away. You keep none of the progress you and your buddy made in his world, so you have to retrace your steps alone to the mine. Then you have to enter the the mine and put down a new summoning sign in there. After that, your friend can then summon you and finally resume the jolly cooperation. The whole ordeal is painfully clunky. This summoning sign system was charming in older DS games, but when I have to travel a couple miles just to cross a fog door, the charm is gone. I would have preferred a nice Multiplayer menu that lets me place my sign down right next to whatever bonfire my friend is waiting at. Better yet, I would have preferred a multiplayer system that lets me just teleport to my friend without him having to wait for a summoning sign to appear at all! I understand why the fog wall is there the game literally cannot handle rendering the underground and above ground portions at the same time. So why not have an instance gate or something (think World of Warcraft dungeon raids) that lets me and my friend choose to load up a new area together?The problems with Elden Ring s open world coop go further than clunky fog doors. When you spend so much time walking across fields, through forests, and over canyons with your buddy, you tend to pass a lot of bonfires and hidden items. The visiting player is not allowed to interact with these things at all. The visitor can thankfully still receive mob drops and gather plants growing in the world, but no exploratory progress carries over when visiting. This makes playing open world coop rather unrewarding for the visitor. Horses are disabled too, which discourages coop play even further. The cherry on top comes when you inevitably die. Since you aren t activating the same bonfires as the host, you are set back a ton. In short, the fantasy of exploring Elden Ring s vast landscape with a pal is undercut by a clunky multiplayer system that has persisted since 2010. I wish there was an option to share a world instance with another player. I want the same items, bonfires, and boss progress! You could call it Elden Ring MMO!A Dark Souls MMO would fail, of course, because FromSoft can t do netcode. I could ignore all of the above issues if the current system was not laden with bugs. In my play session with Mark, I probably random disconnected four different times. An invader popped into the world behind us and, as I went to confront him, I disconnected randomly. It was unplayable, literally. Modders can make a better system than this, and they have!I would like to highlight that my criticisms are aimed primarily at the open world segments of the game, specifically the COOP side of it. Invasions in the open world can be quite fun, offering plenty of places to hide and stalk prey (and the free teleportation items solve those instances when you just can t locate the target). In dungeons, multiplayer gets way better, both COOP and PVP. The more linear progression and tighter play areas hide the flaws inherent in the system, and its frankly just as fun as older titles. I have had tons of fun exploring Raya Lucaria academy with friends and strangers.I think that s the way to do it: multiplayer in the open world is rough. If you are adventuring with a friend, skip straight to the dungeons and play those together. Raya Lucaria, Godrick s Castle, and other zones offer unlimited fun with friends, but big fat Limgrave sucks. Of course, disregard all of this if the random disconnections hit you. You are shit out of luck there, sorry.As mentioned, modders have created a much better multiplayer experience that solves all of the problems listed above (including the random disconnects and crashes!). I recommend checking out the Seamless Co-op mod ASAP!~ ~ ~Original review: Dark Souls with massive, somewhat boring open world travel between dungeons. It is pretty easy to die in this game.Amazing so far!",0
Negative,"My Brother, best friend and I waited a couple of weeks after this game came out and booked time off work to get together and play multiplayer. On one of our computers the DRM prevented them playing multiplayer since it wouldn't launch without modified dll's, when the game would run, half the enemies were invisible and he'd get random crashes. The remaining two of us would crash on almost every attempt to connect to each other. I cannot recommend the game in this state. Hold off until some of this rubbish is fixed.",0
Negative,"- Enemies have 360 degree homing missile attacks.- Unresponsive buttons when trying to retrieve lost runes.- Incredibly unfair aiming with an agenda of its own where you aim at a boss directly in front of you, but the game toggles your focus to the adds WAY over to the sides instead.- Unf**kingbelievable terrible camera at times, when the game will not let me shift my camera off the ground.- Unresponsive controls sometimes. I press LB, but sometimes doesn't respond up to two seconds later. It does this temperamentally.- Enemies can hit through any wall and solid rock, etc. constantly.- Enemies have unfair range and splash damage, landing hits on you when their weapon or spell clearly didn't physically touch you.- You lose your aim lock when they get stunned and you land a critical, even though you don't press any button to disengage, so you lose a vital 0.5 second, by which point the boss gets up at the speed of light and one-shots you.- Aim lock switches automatically to a different enemy all the time. Like when there are TWO bosses, the game decides you should aim at the other boss now because the one you were aiming at is about to die.- Enemies hit THROUGH the boss fog.- The AI clearly gets WAY more aggressive and buffed when you have a substantial number of lost runes to retrieve. I.e. I die, lose a large amount of runes, revive at SOG, suddenly every mob goes Brolly SSJ Ultra Instinct.- When using a Spirit Summons for a boss fight against two bosses, it will always chip away at both bosses a little bit, instead of focusing on one of them. This results in both bosses staying alive for as long as possible, making the fight harder. THIS IS COMPLETELY ILLOGICAL. ALWAYS FOCUS ON ONE AT A TIME.+ It's pretty.+ It's satisfying (at least when you kill a boss legit, and don't end up cheesing them).+ Interesting and wondrous open world.+ Huge variety of enemies.+ Incredibly atmospheric.+ It's fun to mess around with the various weapons and stat scaling.",0

Negative,"Utter shit. Its like they made a good game, challenging, good boss fights, good mechanics. THEN. hired a guy with the task of ""Make our game, as unplayable as you can, where multiplayer is a farce, where there are no instructions early game, where you have to spend 20 mins just setting up mouse and keyboard because the game cant detect what platform you're using. etc.Then. throw little curve-balls in the game, like being teleported to the round table area, where its a 'safe zone' the NPC's all tell you its a safezone, then you drop down a flight of stairs, and some PLAYER 50 level's higher than you murders you, takes all your stuff, (2 hours worth of xp grind). All because the lazy as fk dev's didnt even put any kind of warning sign for a pvp duel area etc.The game could of been good, is kinda fun and challenging, but they literally looked at 'quality of life' settings on other games, and thought they'd do the polar opposite. Hell you even have to craft shit to play with your friends. Its a fucking joke tailored to console, and then still try to charge AAA PC price? Get the fuck out of here.",0
Negative,"Games amazing. probably will be a top 10 all time fav game for me by the time ive finished it, like a perfect storm of souls like meets breath of the wild. HOWEVER its hard to recommend in its current state. when cyberpunk 2077 came out i didn't experience any real notable bugs, i have had 1 crash in 200+ hours playing it, i put it down to having a 3070 being able to bust out the power needed for a good experience with raytracing fully on at 80-90+ FPS in cities even hitting my 144fps in outer city areas. and yet somehow this game is actually unplayable a large portion of the time, even making you feel sick due to the constant frame drops and stutters but yet people give this a pass?The fact that this is a worse launch (for me and seemingly many others) than cyberpunk 2077 how can anyone even recommend this game right now.if they ever patch it i'd strongly recommend but right now even after the hot fix; games a mess on PC.AND DONT START ME ON TERRIBLE UI, K/B&M SUPPORT AND 60FPS CAP IN 2022! DAAA FAAAAAAA",0
Negative,"It absolutely PAINS me to give this incredible game a negative review, but I can't recommend it in good faith. The god awful stuttering and framerate is a killer in this game. I was expecting a Breath of the Wild-like experience, but got homework on game optimization. My Specs: Ryzen 5 3600, GTX 1070ti, 32gb DDR4 ram, game running on ssdAs soon as I got into the open world, I was hit with the stuttering and frame issues. I could immediately tell the game was not running at a smooth 60, and attempting to fight the Tree Sentinel was impossible. The game was constantly locking up for seconds at a time, and the framerate would plummet into the 20s. The graphical settings made zero difference. I was getting the same results on the maximum or lowest settings.Afterwards, I tried all of the fixes and suggestions laid out in this reddit post as well as in the comments: https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/t0q22j/possible_fix_for_pc_frame_rate/Also changed the game to fullscreen borderless. I'm not sure which of these changes actually affected anything as I did everything all at once, but now the game is actually playable, and it's the only reason I can still enjoy it. However, it is FAR from perfect. I still get tons of stuttering and frame drops out in the open world. Considering this game doesn't look any better than Dark Souls 3, it's a pretty big disappointment that this is the case. I've never had any problems with the other From Soft games on PC aside from the first Dark Souls port, but that could easily be fixed with mods.I will gladly change this to a positive review if From Soft actually fixes these issues currently plaguing the PC version of the game. With all this being said, I'm still going to continue playing the absolute shit out of this thing.",0

Negative,"tl;dr: Everything that DS2 got wrong + everything that DS3 got wrong + Skyrim, for whatever reason. I wouldn't say I like this game, but I do not regret buying nor playing it.Inspired level design gave way to perceived difficulty and sheer content mass. The world is beautiful but not memorable, encounters seem to be designed with ""player is gonna skip these anyway"" mentality. At least the ""overworld exploration"" is fine on the QoL side with Torrent, flask refuels and fast travel.Since there is a lot of content, the individual ""level"" design (dungeons and other dense areas) quality varies greatly: some are good, some are obvious filler content.While combat is, on a technical side, a step up from Souls, its simplistic nature does not bode well with outlandish/""anime"" weapons that creep more and more into the roster.Most boss designs seem to embrace ""aggressive == good"" ideology, executing incredibly long chains of attacks with little downtime, which makes them appear visually ""hard"" and ""punishing"". However, with light armor class effectively removed/made redundant it's extremely easy to attain meaningful poise stat and get hits in even with suboptimal approach. What's more, some attacks are so poorly telegraphed that avoiding them is largely a matter of luck/extreme reflexes, so doing this little war of attrition seemed almost unavoidable.Additionally, somehow Estus rationing seems to be almost entirely a non-factor - I got used to chugging it whenever I took a chunk of damage, and it almost never ran out. Can be seen as a good thing for some, but idk.All in all I'd say: I don't love this game, but I probably will be playing it in the same spirit as Skyrim: it's a pile of easily digestible content for hours and hours.",0

The fact this game was released in a state like this is genuinely garbage, as well as the fact that this game to my knowledge was delayed to be polished.

Negative,"Updated (March 19, 2022): The devs nerfed many weapons, and the game is not fun anymore.Game feels very bland with the color and the combat feels a bit clunky, even with light weapons. I am not a fan of this genre of games, but I would keep playing it just to get better and explore more content. I feel miserable the whole time I am playing this game, since I will still die many times, even though I am lv 43 now and can survive alot better.Update: Currently level 150, but the game is still tough. Learning new skills and having a variety of weapons does make combat a bit easier to handle, but the game is still tough for me. Magic is very powerful, and I had to cast several powerful spells and then finish off the boss with melee attacks, as I'm an all balanced build as a ""mystic warrior."" I do hate that several mobs are able to spam attacks without needing stamina, which feels unfair, but you can overcome them (eventually). Good luck training and getting through tougher areas, because while I am getting way better and explored a large area of the game, I am still getting killed to random mobs and spending 1-2 hours per boss fights before finally defeating them. This game is definitely not for everyone, but it does make for a decent skill based game. The colors still looks bland, and my game froze twice so far. Other times, combat feels clunky where my attacks feel slow, even with light weapons and gear. Great music, though.",0
Negative,"This is the Shortened Version of the review:I can't understand how Elden Ring gets this much praise. I could never recommend it because they released Elden ring 4 years after Sekiro and 8 years after Dark Souls 3 which are technically better and more balanced games. Sekiro is not perfect by any means, it does have flaws but it is a tremendous upgrade over Dark Souls 3 and Elden Ring's gameplay mechanics in almost every way, the combat in Dark Souls is a decade old and with Sekiro they succesfullly made them less clunky and more balanced. Now, the main reason i wouldn't recommend is simply that it's worse in almost every way than a 8 year old game the only thing Elden ring brings is an open world with more content, it's their first open world so i won't critisize it too much. Elden ring takes 100 hours to explore everything the first time while the others takes 20/40 at best. It is not a Bad game but after seeing what From Software is capable of creating ,it came up a bit short, and i have to say that i am a bit disappointed. In short Elden Ring has the same design problems as Dark Souls III but has more content and is a gameplay wise less fun and more frustrating. If you decide to buy the game i would say set a timer for 115 minutes and fight the tree sentinel and if by the end of timer you didn't have fun fighting the tree sentinel, you should probably refund the game.This is the longer version of the review:During last week i have been playing this game a bit and poured 20 hours in it, it takes around 50 hours to explore everything and kill everything if you know where to go. To 100 % this game, i don't remember the exact time it took me but you do have to beat the game at least three times. It doesn't require you to do PVP to get all success or farming to get items which is a good thing as it got tedious in previous games.The typical Elden ring boss/enemy has everything, it can close the distance to you or throw a ranged attack faster than you can heal, it has a 5 or more hit combo that has to be dodge in a specific direction, in a specific timing (of course the difficulty of it wildly depends on the boss), most of its attacks are delayed to bait you into dodging early and getting punished by it, some bosses will have large splash damage or aoe attacks, every attacks, even thrust in this game has at least 180 degrees of tracking meaning from the start of the attack to the end of it, it will follow where you go and the hitboxes are always bigger than what models and effects shows.In Sekiro all of this is not as big deal as it is in Elden Ring as you don't need to dodge attacks you only need to deflect them, to heal it isn't that big of a deal because you have swifter and faster movement and pauses after combos gives you enough time to distance yourself from the boss to heal. The deflection mechanic has window that last twice as long as the dodge roll in Elden Ring and it can be repeated if you miss the timing or got tricked by the boss moveset but at a cost of deflection window protecting frames, the more you do repeated deflection in a row the tighter the window gets.All of this is without taking into account the input delay, that every From Software has, you can reduce it by disabling V-sync in NVIDIA Control Panel (RIP AMD users) and playing in windowed mode (to avoid screen tearing from disabling V-sync). The major issue though is that Dodge rolling works on release of the button instead of press and that the dodge roll invincibility frames don't start immediately compared to Sekiro where, although it suffers from the same problems the deflection's start are more consistant and start a lot sooner. In this game you can get up to half a second of delay between the moment you try to dodge until you can actually avoid taking damage. I'm sure From Software is aware of this but they don't care, the problem is present since the first Dark Souls and 11 years later it's still here.This was just about avoiding taking damage, now to dealing damage is another story, to deal damage you first have to avoid the enemies attack by either staying close but needing very accurate dodging or you can take distance but then you will have to close that distance to punish. After that, you now have another problem, if your attack is taking too long you will get punish by the next enemy attack and in this game the pauses between enemy combo is generally very short and some combos can stop after two hit or continue up to 7 hits depending on RNG. Your attacks have the same speed as in Dark Souls 1 but the gameplay pace is twice as fast. This problem is there since Dark Souls 3 where they decided to accelerate the pace after the release of Bloodborne, just like they accelerated the pace after Sekiro without changing your movement and attack speed accordingly. While it is a bit faster it's nowhere near as fast as it would need to be, to make this game balanced and polished. Now i am generalising a lot, so this kind of problems is what i encounter in general, it does not mean these problems happen with every fight and every encounter and with every attack pattern, but this is what i can tell from my experience in general, there is always one move that can easily be punished i'd say, the problem is that, attack pattern are RNG based instead of the game's AI and attack pattern being well made. While in Dark Souls 1 movement and attacks are clunkier the majority of attack patterns can at least be punished by the slowest weapon's light attack from the slowest weapon because the game is slower but fair. In Elden Ring the game isn't fair if you have a slow weapon you will most likely have to trade hits with the boss when learning the boss attack pattern and it ruins the gameplay.Now these are the things that are in previous games that are missing here, these things bring deepness and complexity to games and it's a bit of a shame it's not in the game :-Two Handing made a big difference in DS1 where even a Dexterity weapon deals 400 damage instead of 300-Equipment Load matters in DS1 where you can choose between taking more damage and getting stagger more easily but being faster and having easier and faster roll dodging -Backstabs in DS1 interrupt enemies and are immediate, it doesn't require an animation that can easily whiff and leave you open for a counter attack while you did the right thing-You can upgrade your weapons and armor at the bonfire not forcing you to go to the game's hub everytime(DS1 is the only game where you can upgrade armors)-In Dark Souls 1 weapons and armor have degradation and can even break, for example katana have lower durability, so you need to take care of your equipment-In previous game a hidden mechanic made you take less damage during grabs by mashing some buttons, it works on some grabs with a controller don't know if it works with kb+m-In DS1 a lot of Thrusts attacks can be side steped if timed correctly, mostly impossible now-In Previous Dark Souls you had Plundging attacks (An attack you do when falling down from a certain distance) which dealt a lot of damage and stagger most enemies, in Sekiro you can from stealth one hit almost every enemies with a plunging attack or skip an entire mini-bosses phases or even some bosses though it is specific-In previous Dark Souls you could kick without needing it as a skill-In Sekiro you can pause the game-There's a lot of reused assets in elden ring like player attacks animation or reused enemies -In Sekiro you unlock skills instead of being restricted to 4 rings/talismans -In Sekiro you cannot fall from a cliff unless you jump and if you do it by mistake you don't die but lose a portion of your health and if your health is low enough you die-In Dark Souls 1 when missing the enemies or when the enemy misses you with some weapons you have a larger recovery time with because of the inertia of your hit throwing you off balance",0
Negative,"I dont usually buy day 1 games, I even pre-purchased this one, I have more than the minimum required to play and even playing in low quality with everything off buildings disappear, when I approach the lost grace sometimes the Y button to use it doesnt appear, I have to call the horse like 10 times for it to appear, when I go near the grey fog gates they dont show me any option to go though, enemies disappear sometimes they dont become invisible they just disappear, I was very hyped about this game and its really sad that PC version has TONS of issued, not recommended at least for now",0
Negative,"If you play single player, offline, expect a hard but slightly rewarding game with lots of grinding. Pretty views (littered with tons of glowy runes littering those pretty views with mostly (at least 80%) useless, pointless information (or outright trolly (because people + the anonymity of the internet = most people are a-holes) that will sometimes get in the way of actual game play because those people that do ""that"" have figured out if you place a message where people need to interact they will have to do a specific action to actually do that interaction (press left/right on the d-pad to pick another action) making that interaction take longer than necessary. If you attempt to do co-op, expect a pretty good, game that's mostly enjoyable except when the occasional a-hole decides to ""invade"". Which will happen (remember internet plus anonymity), and when it does you get no warning, no location, and you'll probably be in the middle of that hard (used to be slightly rewarding) game (probably in a fight) so won't be giving as much attention to your surroundings as possible. And chances are that they'll attack you while you're in the middle of a fight because also ""hey lets make it to where these a-holes, don't get seen/ attack by the extremely hostile enemy AI.If you've got actual co-op partners on, and someone ""invades"" expect a decent fight which will most likely result in a win by you and the rest of your co-op partners. UNLESS. (for some strange reason) they can 2-3 hit you like some of the more difficult ai opponents (without backstabbing) and apparently seeing their health bar diminish is hard to see because. you are gonna be surprised and have very few seconds to react to an attack you didn't expect or get warning for (honestly not sure if I truly didn't notice it or if it just wasn't there). Oh yeah and besides if you want/ manage to get away, don't expect to be able to ambush them because they will have at least a marker on their compass always pointing towards you. not so much one on your compass pointing to them (or maybe there is but like I said 2-3 hits isn't a lot of time to check out your ui to make sure everything is as it should be). and good luck locking on to them if or aren't already locked on to anything because the secondary action of the lock-on button is to point the camera into the direction your character is facing, so it is slightly difficult to lock-on to someone as you are dodging around to avoid their attacks.All without the option to turn anything these a-hole can and most likely are doing, off. because, if you're online, you're fair game because you have no choice but to ""opt-in"" to this stupid ""feature"". I mean, ""why would you want to have fun with your friends online, without the eventuality of an a-hole joining your game and ruining the fun.Also, I'm kinda wondering how one person can take on 2 (one heavily armored and one extremely dodgy) individuals without needing to use a health potion/flask once even though both got in multiple hits definitely more than the ""intruder"" did when the game boasts a system ""where higher level players can't go into lower level players games if they're outside of a certain range"".So, yeah good game, good view, good control, interesting differing mechanics. And I would wholly recommend buying if you had the option to turn off the a-holery.But, you don't so, not recommended.",0
Negative,"Having the occasional visual glitch with enemies in crowded environments becoming too transparent to see, beyond that game runs fine on a no where near current PC, bug fix is apparently in the works.As for gameplay, its darksouls in a sandbox, did you want dark souls in a sandbox? because that's what it is, and that's what you get. no idea how deep the game goes, will only really know in like a year or two at my pace.Edit: that's what I thought at first, but no, the game takes a sharp SHARP nosedive in quality and interesting encounters in the late game, even after the first huge dip in quality (that coincidentally perfectly aligns with the area the beta allowed people to play)Reused enemies near constantly, difficulty going up by just making enemies faster, stagger less and deal more damage, the game design equivalent of a secret cry for help, surely because the designers ran out of ideas half way through filling their game world and instead of shrinking it decided to stretch what they had to an absurd level. I have yet to have a single encounter with an enemy or special type of location or mechanic that the game didn't just copy paste two or three times else where.Multiple patches have come out and no glitches in my game have been solved, not gotten worse either but you don't get points for not fucking things up worse.the worst thing and the reason I am changing my review to negative after so many hours is the end game section I have reached which has been ""Boss"" empty corridor ""Boss"" empty corridor ""Boss"" Empty corridor ""Boss"" ""Boss"", if someone out there is blown away by this set piece that is as interesting and innovative as a shopping list let me know, I want to know what you don't find interesting.Dark souls Defined a type of gaming that changed how people approach both playing and building games.Elden Ring turns out is someone trying to copy it as closely as possible to not offend long time players without remembering the subtlety, care and innovation that went into the original work.Will I keep playing it?, probably, nostalgia caries a lot of weight, but I can't recommend anyone who's on the fence to buy this, wait for bloodborne on PC or get the earlier games in the dark souls series, don't come into this expecting anything outstanding or novel, and certainly don't come into this thinking its finally the accessible dark souls game, that only lasts for the first zone and disappears without a trace.",0
Negative,"(Note: I'm not a native English speaker)I really, really wanted to enjoy this game. Like many players who never played ""souls-like"" games, I bought into the hype and jumped into the world of Elden Ring. But it's been a disappointing experience, personally. I will be honest, though, I think the game itself is very well made and has some very nice design, even if the tech is a bit behind in terms of graphical quality and performance. But the lack of an entertaining or captivating story and the dull repetition of fighting scores of monsters and bosses without motivation or purpose sealed the deal for me. The game is more like a competitive sports game, where you get satisfaction from timing and analyzing each fight and then rinse and repeat. I guess I'm from an older generation, and after a few hours of roaming across Elden Ring, I got terribly bored of doing the same thing without knowing why I was doing it and without a captivating intrigue to keep me interested. In other words, I couldn't see myself going for another 100 hours of this torment. But again, I'm not judging the games' qualities. Clearly, it resonates with many people and seems to be very well made, as I said above. It's just not for me, and I cannot recommend it to others looking for the same things I mentioned earlier and would nevertheless also fall for the internet hype that's trying to make you try the game even if you're a ""souls-sceptic"". I've asked for a refund. Maybe I'll try again once the game goes Gold.",0

Negative,"If you're looking for a solo souls game, it's amazing (with the expected bag of artificial and legit difficulty). If you were hoping for an epic adventure with a co-op buddy, don't bother. If you were looking for solo PVP, don't bother.How From Software choose to be stubborn about keybind issues, poor PC support, 60fps lock, no different aspect ratios, shoddy networking, and the make co-op even more tedious by not allowing progress to share with anyone who isn't the host is beyond me, nonetheless a great experience, if alone.",0
Negative,This game is not ready for PC. No Ultra Wide support (is this 2012?) Frame rate is locked. Really? Not a true Co-Op game. Keyboard controls were an after thought. This feels like another port of a console game.Maybe I'll re-buy after it gets updated for PC.,0
Negative,"The PC performance being occasionally sub-par is not the reason for my negative review as that is usually a short temporary issue that will fix itself quickly, what I strongly dislike is the fact Elden Ring does a great job of making you motion sick if you are used to games that have good camera controls. In its current state you will be CONSTANTLY fighting the camera readjusting it upon any sideways movement or elevation changes, the camera will permanently try to auto-center itself with zero in-game or config files to fix this horrid system.For Example:If you are at a cliff looking at something down off into the distance and you attempt to continue looking at that while strafing along the cliff you will immediately have to start fighting with the camera as it tries to auto rotate to behind the character at all times forcing you to constantly have either jittery vision or zig-zagging vision as you attempt to keep the camera locked onto the thing you are looking at. Couple this with doing *ANYTHING* outside of combat (or in combat with multiple enemies that require de-targetting in any way) if you are a player who often uses left and right strafing movement when you play games it becomes very nauseating, after a few hours I had to just stop playing entirely because it was ruining the game for me, maybe in the future mods will come out disabling this pointless system but until then it's got to be a no from me",0

The game has great visuals, and great/awe inspiring locations. and if there's any backstory of those locations or any reason the state most of them are in, I haven't found it. Same for any NPCs that you might find. Same for most everything. I basically spent 39 hours playing tourist and sightseeing.

Negative,"Maybe a bit of history so you understand where I am coming from: I played DS1- DS3, even speedran DS1 at a certain point. I had no issues with these games. Then I progressed through to Sekrio, had 0 trouble with the game and can play through it deathless no problem.But this, this abomination of a game, this is just too f*cking much.I am trying my HARDEST to really enjoy or like the game but f*ck me, Miyazaki must have been on crack while he designed this game, this is not even hard anymore to the point of ""I enjoy a good challenge"", this is hard to the point of ""trying to demolish a skyscraper using nothing but your flaccid c*ck"".My biggest complaints: The open world (because everything needs to be open world nowadays for some unknown f*cking reason) gives you the option to accidentally wander into areas you are WAY too underleveled for. I think I had to ignore about 80% of the bosses I found so far because I was doing f*ck all damage to them while they could just one-shot me. I mean the game literally throws you into the world and the first boss you encounter is meant to kill you, like in Sekiro. Only the second boss in Sekiro was a way to learn the game, the difficulty gradually ramped up. The second boss in this, 20 minutes into the game, is a gold knight on a horseback that you are lucky if you can even stick close to and that will tear you the f*ck to bits. Think it gets better from here? Nope, downward trend. The game kind of lacks clear direction for you to explore. Because you explore, find a boss, he wrecks you instantly while you do zero damage, okay guess I shouldn't be here. So you go to another area, same sh*t different story. Great so you mozy up on to the next area, hoping that this is the path forward. only to get f*cked by the next boss you basically don't deal damage to. LIKE WHAT DO YOU WANT?! Why did this have to be open world? Was the level design Dark Souls is so infamous for suddenly not good enough? Guiding the player through increasing challenges to show that yes, you are in fact in the right area and this is the intended level of challenge. No, completely lacking here. For all I know I could walk down a super late game area with an absolutely crazy boss, who knows.Which kind of brings me to the next point: Previous souls bosses always gave you a clear window to punish their attacks. They had some sort of weak point, maybe a combo which they always stood still at the end of or something along those lines. These bosses? Not a chance. It's as if they sniffed a line before the fight, almost every boss I have found so far jumps around the arena as if their life depended on it. Like you don't get to even punish them because by the time they are finished with their combos you have about a second to get close enough to land a single hit, which almost chips away nothing from their health bar. Think about it like fighting a Yhorm healthbar from DS3 with the mobility of Cinder and his stamina health bar is about 16x bigger. Oh and did I mention he takes practically no breaks in trying to kill you? Yeah fun was had by all.And after you grinded down the boss, learned their moveset, put up with their massive mobility buffs they received in this game, you get what feels like 100 souls for your effort. Great, only that I already need like 5000 souls to even level up once. Like the f*ck, in other DS games I could at least level up once or twice with the souls a boss gives me. It felt like a reward for killing a boss, and here? It is like you dig a hole with a toothbrush only for someone to give you a swift kick in the nuts once you are done. What is even the point then of finding and killing the bosses if they give you almost nothing in return?I really am trying to like this game, but it feels like more of a ""Okay fine you want difficult, I give you difficult"" for fans that were like ""MEEEH DS1 TOO EASY, I BEAT IT BLIND USING ONLY MY TONGUE TO CONTROL THE GAME FIRST TIME, MEEEEE NEED HARD MOD"". Anybody else who just wants to have some sort of challenge and a bit of fun overcoming difficulty is immediately greeted with a brick wall every time you find a boss.That on top of the usual Dark Souls bullsh*ttery that was never really challenging but always just annoying has been cranked up to 500%. Like hey, here is a bonfire, you're saved! Oh wait, no you can't go back to that long path you just cleaned up, no turning back, move forward lol because that is how it has to be for some f*cking reason.Hey, this enemy is standing pretty conveniently for a backstab, right? Oh too bad because there's like idk a bear appearing out of nowhere the size of a whale that will insta kill you.Hey, you found a crab and killed it? Oh wait nvm there's like 6 bigger ones now.Hey, you remember how mimics were at least a cool mechanic that made you a bit paranoid every time you find a chest? Well get ready to be teleported to an area with super overleveled enemies and lose all your souls again.Haha, great fun was had by all.I sincerely don't get this. This is not a challenge, this is ""Fan service for reddit: The game"". This is neither suited for Souls game beginners (like some asinine reviewers seriously suggested - I am a souls veteran and this game is already giving ME trouble), nor is this for people that just want to experience anything beyond frustration over the difficulty curve. I'll try to finish this, who knows, maybe I'll change my mind later on, at first I didn't really like Sekiro either. But for now this is just beyond anything I could even attempt to enjoy. TL;DR Miyazaki was so occupied with thinking about what he could, that he forgot to ask himself if he should.Edit: So wow, this gamer just gets better and better. Now I found a boss where it obviously has to rain inside the arena and who is so detailed and textured, it makes the game screech to a halt at like 30fps. Obviously the game swallows half my inputs and this otherwise fairly beatable boss becomes a nightmare. It just really is the gift that keeps on giving. But having this lag inducing rain in the bossfight was imperative, right Miyazaki?",0
Negative,"Maybe it's just not the sort of game I normally play, but:1) The ""story"", such as it is, is just random mumbo jumbo spouted by anime characters. I've literally no clue what I should be doing or where I should be going.2) The fighting appears to be identical. The entire game is just endless identical fights, with occasional bosses. Roll, jump, hit. Repeat ten thousand times, presumably. Can that really be the entire game?3) I assumed at this price that this would be an all-singing-and-dancing production. But the support for PC users with mouse and keyboard is literally the worst control interface I have *ever* come across in any game, no matter how small. The standard keybinds are horrible, the shortcuts are horrible, the ability to remap keys is negligible. And there's nothing remotely intuitive about it. It took me ages just to work out how to use the character creation because the ability to go back a page requires a right click to bring up a menu and then a left click on the correct option. You can't even close open in-game windows with *the escape key*. It's abysmal. Truly.I'll keep cracking on for another hour or so, but I feel like I'm doing so to justify the whopping price I just paid, rather than out of any sense of enjoyment.Edit: I just played another hour. Will be uninstalling now. I just don't know what the point of the game is, other than endlessly killing the same mobs in the same way in the same places until you get killed by something, and then start again. And the fact that just to quit the game requires at least 3 right mouse clicks on two menus tells you everything you need to know about the interface. Awful.",0
Negative,"My first ""souls"" type game and I think I enjoy it so far, but the game feels buggy and I have had a couple of crashes so far. The game runs rather smooth until I encounter a few stutters that usually turns into a full game freeze/crash. This has happened after 15 minutes and another time after 45 minutes. I am disappointed that I cannot have more than one character or save slot, that seems like a huge oversight these days. I have been playing on a wired xbox one controller and it feels like some presses are getting lost intermittently as I jump or roll. I wouldn't recommend this game at this time.",0
Negative,"I guess I am the odd one out, but this game sucks. Stuttering, boring mess. Graphics are abysmal and do not make you feel immersed in the world. Bow controls are absolutely terrible.Might buy it in a few years when it's patched and worth the $4.99 it's selling for. Rip off at this price point,Refunded",0
Negative,"I'm a long-time souls fan. I have a character on DS1 who I've played the game with 79 times, I've finished DS2 thrice and DS3 five times; I've played Bloodborne two times (the first time through was just so good that I didn't feel the need to go back in again) and Sekiro once. I've completed both the original Demon's Souls AND the remake, all the King's Fields (save for the Japan-exclusive one), and Shadow Tower: Abyss. Of all these games that I have listed, I like Elden Ring the least.I know this is a controversial take, but hear me out. I'm currently on my fourth playthrough, but the flaws of the game started to shine through far earlier-flaws that were present-albeit to a much lesser extent-in DS3. I believe that over the years, the difficulty of the Souls games has become one of their most notable features, despite the fact that previous entries in the series were praised for their immaculate level design, story, and bosses. This is especially apparent in Elden Ring and DS3-certain questionable balancing decisions are chalked up to ""it's a Souls game"" and complaints are met with ""git gud,"" which means that FromSoft gets off with a free pass where other developers would face serious backlash. The boss design of Elden Ring is fantastic at best. At worst? At worst the greatest challenge goes from being not dying in game to not killing yourself in real life-and this game is at or near its worst very frequently. Bosses hold attacks for 2-3 seconds-so long that dodging becomes unintuitive-before releasing a lighting-quick flurry of attacks that will very likely decimate your health, irrespective of whatever armor you're wearing. The sheer amount of AOE bosses is absurd, and beating a boss on the first try is next to impossible because the fight is reduced to trial, error, and execution; in earlier titles, attacks came out with a sense of weight and impact-they were telegraphed, exhilarating, and fun to face down (excluding certain bosses. Looking at you, Capra Demon. I hope you still have all those dung pies I chucked corroding your flesh in hell). Elden Ring usually fails in this respect. It fails BAD.While the level design is certainly good for an open world, it doesn't even come close to the tightly woven tapestry of DS3 and DS1-you've been trekking across the world for hours, open a door, and all of a sudden you're back at Firelink with a shortcut opened. In Elden Ring, things rarely interconnect so neatly; this isn't the developers' fault, but rather a shortcoming of the fundamental philosophies behind an open-world game.The balancing team fucking dipped. You want a fun build? Want to tank a boss with poise and heavy armor that could crush a Toyota Tacoma? Too bad, run dex. Seriously, everything hits so hard that your only course of action is just not to get hit. Heavy and light armor aren't discrete-they just smudge together in a blend of incompetence and fragility. That new weapon or Ash of War that you got is probably not going to be nearly as good as whatever boring option you have now; you'll need to find new openings in combat to use either one for little reward considering the tankiness of most enemies. And weapon scaling is far less dependent on stats-instead, the real booster lies in upgrading your weapon. It's an unwelcome departure from previous entries, at least for me.The lore is.I mean, it's good. Vaati's still got great content on it. The story's alright. It isn't full of tear-jerking moments like DS1 or 3-let's toss 2, Bloodborne, and Sekiro in there as well-but it's pretty serviceable and waaaaay more accessible than the aforementioned games (aside from Sekiro). I could get into more, but this review's creeping into the length of a master's thesis so I'm going to cut it short. The game still has wonderful art design, the character creator is as goofy as ever, and the music is quite nice. Do I recommend the game? Still no. I think if some of the more egregious balancing choices were rectified, I would revise this review, but as of now, the game just isn't very fun.",0
Negative,"One of the few games which I have paid full price for due to its stellar reviews and no small amount of peer pressure. This game, needless to say, had a very high bar to hit for me and unfortunately it fell quite short.First of all, I feel like I should mention I'm not a souls player so I came into this game with little experience other than a bash at Dark Souls 3 way back when it came out. When I saw the online co-op tag I was very optimistic as I have quite a few friends who enjoy fantasy games and roaming a world filled with eldritch horrors ready to nom on your party sounded amazing in my naivety. However after getting through the tutorial and quite a while of attempting the summons for friends it soon became apparent that this game is all but impossible to play properly with people. Many of the vital features of the game are disabled in multiplayer so travelling with someone for any length of time is all but out of the question. DON T BE FOOLED! This is a single player game where you can occasionally call in help for a hard boss. So I was already off to a less than ideal start.The game describes its story as being multilayered and fractured which is true to an extent. The story is so fractured in fact that I truly had no idea where I was or what I was really doing for most of the time I was playing. Those few NPCs I was able to interact with were so UNBELIEVABLY dull and spoke so slowly that by the time they d told me what tiny bit of information they had to offer I d already gone to sleep. There's basically no information about where I was save for a name and a vague clue as to the history in the intro but other than that? Nothing. I was so uninvested in the world and its story that rather than me feeling like I was rushing to prevent some big event (like in all the other good RPGs I ve played) I simply felt like I was wandering aimlessly and occasionally bumping into some massive horror to rail me. Even just a few lore notes about locations or creatures dotted around the place would have made the world infinitely better and I really feel like this is one of the game s major downfalls at the moment. I m not going to sugar coat this for anyone. It s hard. This in and of itself is not a bad thing as a challenging game can often be the most rewarding. However as someone who has briefly played souls games before I had hoped that they would have updated some of the clunky nature and feel of gameplay. They haven t. The lock on system is dreadfully inconsistent and god forbid you ever get into a fight with more enemies than one as it often just refuses to switch targets or outright de-locks you if you try to. The movement is absolutely made for a controller so don t even think about trying keyboard and mouse. You ll be off a cliff faster than you can say Where s that damn woman with my spirit bell . While this itself isn t a damming feature, they could at least make the game handle well when you do use one. Even with a controller the number of times I ve ended up off cliffs for no reason other than my character deciding to turn like a bus is embarrassing for a game which needs to have accurate movement. To summarise, the game feels clunky and cumbersome with a tendency to straight up ignore your commands. Without spoiling too much of the game for those still looking to play, this game is a nightmare for trying to find well anything really. With so many areas to explore and little-to-no help from markers or the map, finding anything without first consulting the wiki or a guide is a pain and will likely take hours of wandering in a world you know and probably care nothing about. To make matters worse, some of these items make the game practically impossible without and can set you on a path of failure easily when you miss the hidden signs. In short, without any foreknowledge you are bound to miss vital things on your first run and will likely get as frustrated as I did looking all over for them.This game is good. I had a blast playing and cannot deny that parts of it felt truly amazing. However I can t bring myself to say it's worth the full price Or even half price really. For me, it was over hyped and didn t deliver on the majority of aspects which I was hoping for in a AAA open world RPG. It s main saving grace and the reason I will likely keep playing it is the visual aspect of the game. The stunning scenery and breathtaking views really are quite something even on the turd settings which most will likely have to play this system-greedy game on. In short, probably better to pick up a copy of Skyrim for cheap and mod it to achieve a far better experience.",0
Negative,"The game is fine, its just not worth the money. The looks are what you should expect of a game today, nothing ""game changing"" but it is really pretty. The game play is a little clunky; rolls get hung up on near by objects, certain character animations can be interrupted by some actions and not others, camera movement is less than ideal and fall damage is less consistent than it should be. All in all, it more annoying than difficult. I suppose, in part, its the way the game play is designed. I would rather the game be truly difficult and have a sense of accomplishment when progressing. But with ER, its just annoying! I get no feeling of accomplishment. Its just on to the next clunky event. Unfortunately, how pretty it is just isn't worth the money.",0
Negative,"Base game is good for a souls game. DLC is nonstop 1-2 shot everything and because of that endless load screens. Guess they're taking a page from Bethesda in an indirect way. Balance is atrocious, and trashes build diversity right out the gate. Wait for a few patches I guess. Or the bargain bin later. Update:If you want to see some examples of how little time they spent balancing just watch some broken builds on youtube that are trivial to setup. Sure they'll nerf those, but the lazy boosted numbers / no stamina limit / only unga bunga poise break mobs will be left the way they are. Lazy balancing is the new ""difficulty""!",0
Negative,"This game took me back in 2012, when Dark Souls dropped on pc. Let me tell you, it was an unplayable piece of crap and the modders had to take care of the abysmal programming skills of the developers. Now its 2022 and here we go again, an almost unplayable piece of crap dropped on pc. But this time is different, thanks to the sublime Easy Anticheat, the loving FromSoftware stopped anything and anyone that tries to fix their damn game and want to play online. Don't get me wrong, i'm 10 hours in and the game seems good like the other FS ips, but in this state i will never recommend it to anyone. You sold 12 million copies around the world and the majority of them are on pc. fix this fucking game you money grabbing pieces of shit.",0
Negative,"I got this game as a present, so mind that this is not a review concerning the game itself - which might really be a cool blockbuster-, but a harsh critique fowards Fromsoftware, Bandai and Steam concerning ""full controller support"".LMFAO, 100 of the 104 minutes in game I have so far, come from logging on/off trying several work arounds to get my xbox gamepad working. It is 2022 as I am writing this, so Windows has been around for. 30 years now.Probably not noticed by every developer, right? So, other than a console a PC is by design made for several USB-Input Devices, as ofc should be the OS. Besides usual USB devices like a printer, I am using a Virpil HOTAS, a Thrustmaster simracing wheel and ofc keyboard mouse are connected.I could find a work-around (Big Picture controller settings, download control settings from community, where I found the one by GreatLiu working, but that just maps the keyboard keys to the xbox layout.So why is this not plug-and-play as it should be?Why is Steam and the game showing everything okay, you get the xbobx-icons in game but you have to use kbm for input?Why is the most recommended setup that can be downloaded a work-around that maps keyboard input to the controller?Why does it produce different results when setting up the game and/or starting it in Big Picture mode or not? Why does any driver or device emulator like Vjoy have to be deinstalled?Why is unplugging keyboard and mouse a solution for this? I mean, ok yes, but a bit archaic, isn't it?Why does it seem to work, when Steam or Nvidia Overlay are switched off?Why is there no general support from FromSoftware, Bandai or Steam provided? Kudos to the community who put guides, videos and so on out there, but unfortunately most of these guides give you several options to test. Why does it still show gampad icons in game, when I have chosen kbm as primary input device?This is, and I am sorry to say that, ridiculous. Nothing more and nothing less.",0

Negative,"As a long time Dark Souls player, it saddens me that I have to give this a negative review. I will list several problems with the game below, but to be completely honest, the main reason I don't like the game is that I find it boring and dull. I could probably overlook some of the other flaws if the game was more engaging and fun to explore.It took me 13 hours to find enough crafting materials to get my weapon above +2 and 18 hours before I could get it to +4 and a second one to +2. The weapons can go up to +25. I also hadn't found a shop that sells upgrades or enemies that drop them. I eventually looked up where to get them because not being able to experiment with different weapons was making the game less enjoyable. Apparently, there's one place in the early area that you can find weapon upgrades, but if you don't find that you're starved for materials. This would have been ok if it were a normal souls game where everything is connected (rather than an open world), but even those games had MULTIPLE areas where enemies dropped crafting materials and vendors that sold them.Another thing about weapons is that they are often D scaling (or C at best) so you have to spend several upgrades before you know whether they're good or not. I guess that's ok if weapons go up to +25, you know they'll eventually get decent scaling. However, I was playing blind so I had no idea about that.People say to explore, but most of the time I've felt it to be unrewarding. I go through an entire area and am lucky to find more than one or two things of interest. There's that one mine weapon upgrades I mentioned earlier, but these things are scattered out and I missed out on that so I was screwed.I was actually optimistic about having an open world despite the success of previous Souls games. However, everything just feels empty. Open world is supposed to mean there's more options, but I'm finding barely anything. A few weapons, only one place to buy spells (well, one for sorcery and one for miracles). I've yet to find an armor set aside from 2 or 3 in shops. This is after 18 hours of play.Also, the difficulty is kind of annoying. Bosses are either super easy or extremely hard. I'm sure there's someone in the comments that's going inevitably tell me to ""git gud"" or some variation, but I said it first so.And a lot of the bosses don't even give you much in terms of rewards.Another thing is the performance - which might be somewhat excuseable if the game looked gorgeous, but it doesn't look any better than Dark Souls 3 and worse than modded Skyrim. I'm sure someone in the comments is also going to criticize me for mentioning Skyrim lol. I have a RTX 2060 with 10900 processor and yet I can barely run the game 1080p/60fps.Something else about the weapon upgrades and upgrading my health is that they don't actually seem to help that much. At the end of the day, it's roll to win. I know Dark Souls has always been like that to a certain extent, but it's gotten worse with every game. I've long defended Dark Souls as being an RPG where you have choices with your character, but it seems like it's becoming more of an action game tbh. I actually do like the rolling aspect and rarely use a shield, but bosses have gotten faster with each game. Yeah, I know. I need to just git gud. Haha. In this game, you don't just have the option to summon player or NPCs, but also various creatures (which cost mana to summon so it's somewhat balanced). Summoning beasts as followers is a cool idea, but you can only use them in certain spots and then they disappear if you leave. It's kind of confusing and I had to look up how it works.",0
Negative,"Unfortunately I can't recommend. The reasons? Yup performance issues just like every other person. Constant stutters. Invisible enemies. Random DC's when summoned or other people were summoned (no it's not my internet nor anyone else's). Enemy animations that play at under 5 fps so you don't see that they are attacking until you are hit. All of these are there ALL THE TIME. The only reason I got 10 hours in so far is because my friends could kill the invisible enemies for me. Bosses that were in dungeons were fine, but ones outside in the open are still an issue. Today I tried doing a couple things by myself on a new character and instantly stopped because it was unplayable.This isn't acceptable at all. I know the developers are fantastic but there is no excuse. The game is literally unplayable for so many people. Every single new game that is coming out I ignore because of this. Because developers hype up a game for it to always be awful in one way or another. The only reason I got this was because I trusted the developer and had a couple friends to play it with. Big mistake on my part. All these big game companies are greedy and want to scam people just to make money. You can't tell me that this game deserved the critic reviews they did. There is absolutely no way you get 9's and 10's across the board and have this bad and this common of issues.Will I change my review if they fix all these performance issues? No. Never. I will not encourage companies to release unfinished games. No matter who it is. They released this game knowing there were issues and big ones at that.I was excited that I got a patch when I got on today but I guess it didn't do anything. I would expect it to take at minimum a week anyway to fix stuff like invisible enemies. It is reassuring however that they publicly posted about the performance issues, but also maybe they had just planned to make an announcement. Either way, announcing something within 24 hours shows they are better developers than most other big companies. It gets my hopes up that I will eventually get to enjoy the game, even though it has already been ruined a good amount because of the horrible launch.",0
Negative,"I'll admit, this game looked pretty fun when I bought it about 2 years ago. Now after 240 hours of chipping away at the FIRST BOSS, still unable to beat it, I cannot reccomend this game to anyone not proficient in sous games or is a fan of masochism. I'll admit I'm not the greatest of gamers, but when you cant beat the first boss, that should really tell you something",0

Negative,"Disclaimer: If you're a FromSoft fanboy man-child who believes this game is above criticism, go away. This review is NOT for you, and your input is beyond useless. Your childish elitism & gatekeeping tendencies preclude you from offering helpful insight to gamers (like me) who're new to the world of FromSoftware. Disclaimer 2: This is not a ""negative"" review per se, nor is it an admission of my own discontent with the game overall. After 10hrs of gameplay, I simply wouldn't recommend this title to most gamers who aren't familiar with (or don't enjoy) Souls-like games. I might update this review later after 30+hrs if my mind changes, but for right now, I cannot enthusiastically recommend this game to most people. Here's my reasoning: FromSoftware RPGs are notoriously challenging death simulators that pit players against an onslaught of unforgiving bosses. Elden Ring is no exception, but you should know that this title's inaccessibility isn't limited to just boss fights; practically every major aspect of this game is counter-intuitive and needlessly obtuse. Here's a few examples: * There's almost no guidance. At the start of the game, you have an opportunity to partake in a 10 minute tutorial. The tutorial is entirely optional and somewhat easy to miss. After that, the in-game guidance is limited to occasional tool-tips and vague suggestions from NPCs. The problem is that Elden Ring's mechanics are so deep & counter-intuitive, you're guaranteed to miss out on crucial insights unless you spend a few hours watching YT tutorials or reading Wiki pages. This is completely unnecessary - From Software could have easily included an in-game glossary & tutorial system that teaches players about the leveling/scaling, attribute soft caps, item types & more. * Quest lines are often hidden, confusing & easily broken. Some of the major items you need to progress through the game are only accessible through certain NPC-triggered quest lines. The problem is that many of these crucial quests are scattered throughout the most obscure corners of the map. To make matters worse, if you accidentally miss some of these quests & progress too far in the main story, you run the risk of losing out on the opportunity to complete them. The game doesn't tell you this. Even more confusing, some quests are only accessible if you return to previously unlocked Sites of Grace at certain times. But why would you know this? * Success in Elden Ring is almost entirely about optimizing your character's build, but the game doesn't tell you this. Trust me, before you even think about trying to create a ""balanced"" build, research the hell out of how classes, leveling/scaling, spells, weapon mechanics etc. work. These are brilliant mechanics that determine your playstyle & what sort of armor, weapons, spells, skills & talismans you need to focus on. But again, the game doesn't spell this out. If you think you can just pick up the game and intuit these systems, you're in for a very frustrating experience. * The story is almost nonexistence, and therefore, offers almost no guidance or structure. Yes, there is a story plot. Yes, there is tons of lore permeating the vast open-world. No, none of it makes any sense, nor is it fleshed out. Elden Ring has one of the most generic & convoluted RPG plots imaginable. It's all utter nonsense and practically meaningless. Don't expect the plot to inform your objectives or help you make sense of the world most of the time. Just know you're a generic ""hero"" that runs around collecting runes (basically XP that can be spent on leveling up stats), random items, leveling up and fighting big baddies. * The purpose of many (most?) items is a complete mystery. What the f*** are Ashes of War? What does a talisman do? What do Golden Runes do? What are some of the more valuable items you should be pursuing? Better Google it, because like everything else in this game, it won't f***ing tell you. There's no doubt in my mind Elden Ring is appropriately deemed one of the best (if not the best) Souls-like games in existence. But if you're a casual gamer, you might be mistaken in interpreting the dozens of 10/10 scores as signifying Elden Ring's superiority across numerous gameplay categories. This is a mistake. * Elden Ring is a mediocre open-world game. The open-world in this game is vast, beautifully crafted and intriguing. However, exploration in this game is limited to finding dungeons, churches, Sites of Grace, NPCs, bosses, items, and bad guys. There are puzzles scattered throughout the world, but for the most part, you're basically doing the same 4-5 things spread over an absolutely MASSIVE open-world. The world isn't nearly as dynamic as Breadth of the Wild or even Grand Theft Auto V. Most of the novelty is limited to a truly impressive variety of enemy types; there's no shortage of cleverly designed baddies to kill (or die from). Open-world exploration gets a solid 7/10. * Elden Ring is a terrible story-driven RPG. DO NOT go into this game expecting a gripping, story-driven experience. Like I mentioned earlier, Elden Ring's story is almost nonexistence. It's practically irrelevant, and I simply do not care about it. It almost feels as if ER's story and lore was generated by an unsophisticated AI. If you're looking for a compelling story-driven RPG, skip it, as you'll get a 4/10 experience. This is NOT Witcher 3. * Elden Ring is NOT inherently difficult. Believe it or not, ER's difficulty is almost entirely predicated on your knowledge of the game's mechanics & also your approach to lvling. This is due to the various OP rune farming exploits that allow you to rapidly level up your character within the first few hours of the game. It's entirely possible to lvl your character up to lvl 99 and complete most of the game in under 20hrs. In fact, this game is so easy, many Souls-like fans intentionally handicap themselves by avoiding lucrative rune farms, abilities, etc. to make boss fights more challenging. This means that ER even falls short in the category of ""rewarding challenge."" My personal gaming philosophy forbids me from making video games harder than they need to be, so I give Elden Ring a 6.5/10 in terms of difficulty. * Elden Ring is NOT innovative whatsoever. I cannot think of a single groundbreaking element Elden Ring has introduced to the world of gaming. This is a totally derivative product. Everything that separates Elden Ring from traditional RPGs is borrowed from previous SoulsBourne entries. Even within the boundaries of the SoulsBourne genre, the only novel (significant) elements ER brings to the table are the ability to jump, ride horses and explore an open-world. Elden Ring gets a 2/10 in terms of originality. 1. Is needlessly confusing & obtuse. 2. Requires a significant time-investment in independent research to understand the game. 3. Has clunky RPG quest mechanics. 4. Is a mediocre exploration/open-world game. 5. Has a thin, bizarre story. 6. Has been TOTALLY oversold as a ""meaningful challenge."" 7. Is completely derivative. So is Elden Ring a ""bad"" game? No. Not at all. I'm personally intrigued by the in-depth build mechanics & breadth of playstyle possibilities. The game provides an incredible sense of freedom. I also love the idea of ""breaking the game."" That is, figuring out clever ways of vanquishing difficult bosses in as few tries as possible (ex: I defeated the Tree Sentinel by exploiting a flaw in his AI within the first 5hrs of gameplay). The possibilities are practically endless, and it rewards problem-solving. Just remember:This is NOT a casual gaming experience. This is NOT a conventional RPG. This is NOT an intuitive game.",0
Negative,"Massive pile of turd , runs like crap , visually it looks 6 years old with just copied pasted textures everywhere even on ultra settings. Keys and mouse are super unresponsive , 49.99 I dont think so, refunded !",0
Negative,"This is a really good game, but I can't recommend it until they fix the frame rate issues on PC. I have a decent PC (RTX 2070, Intel I-9, 32 GB ram), so I shouldn't be averaging 20-30 fps, but that is what I get in this game.The good: Great Story / World building I like the hands off way quests are handled, you don't usually get map markers. Though a journal or something to remind the player what an npc said would be nice. Combat mechanics are good and fun, just like any other FromSoftware game Very large map to explore, I have about 100 hours and have definitely not explored everything there is to explore. This was my first FromSoftware game, and while challenging I found it to be accessible. I never got too stuck on any boss, as if I did I could just go explore elsewhere and come back to it when I was stronger.The bad: Major frame rate issues I didn't like the jumping puzzle parts, I found the control a bit clunky, though I am on keyboard + mouse Target locking an enemy / boss can hurt more than help, with how it leads to wild camera movements, and how easy it is to accidentally switch to a different enemy Co-op is not easy to do, don't expect to be able to play the whole game with a friend",0
Negative,"Game performance is awful, constantly spikes because it has to load assets all the time. Game crashes or freezes every now and then. Inputs are dropped, deaths due to bugs, parrying is inconsistent. The overworld feels very empty and optional content like dungeons are extremely bland, easy and unrewarding. Enemies that you deal with when on the main path are extremely frustrating to deal with. They're still using the same low quality online system and haven't fixed a lot of small annoyances that have been in the engine since Dark Souls 2. If you're looking for another Dark Souls game look elsewhere. If you can't deal with crappy PC ports also look elsewhere.",0
Negative,"Regardless of the game content, this game does not deserve a positive review. Let's see.- No ultrawide support, it actually works but the game puts black boxes intentionally to force the 16:9 aspect ratio.- 60 fps cap in 2022- controller prompts while no controller is plugged in? Esc key doesn't work as escape- awful regional pricing- Stutter issues which I haven't experienced because I refuse to play it more until it's fixed. I have to bypass the anticheat and risk my account getting banned just to play the singleplayer game on ultrawide :D.- The game didn't exist correctly and HDR mode stayed enabled on my monitor until I shut the game d own from task managerFuck off FromSoftware",0
Negative,"PROS:- Good weapon, level, monster, and boss design as expected for a FromSoftware game- Absolutely stunning visuals, brings you a vivid fantasy world- Visual-driven discovery. Follow your heart and you will find the secrets of the world. You are not tied to quests. CONS:- Easy Anti-Cheat (EAC) prevents the game from even launching and falsely bans players.- 60 FPS cap, constant stuttering and FPS drop, no ultrawide support- Buggy graphics. For me, bloodstain doesn't show anything. For a friend, all enemies are invisible. - Terrible mouse&keyboard support, while refusing connecting to my controller (which works for DS3 and all other games).- Resolution stays when the game exits. (I am playing at 1080p on a 4k monitor, exiting the games leaves it at 1080p). - Too difficult to make your character look like homo sapiens. - Disappointing small dungeons.Is it a good game? YES.Do I recommend it? NO, the number of issues with the port is straight unacceptable. Let me explain. For your reference, my setup is Ryzen 5950X + RTX A4000 (you can take it as a 3070ti equivalent) + PCIE gen4 SSD + 64G 3200Hz ECC memory. It should be an overkill for most games at 1080p. However, this game frequently drops to ~40 FPS has frequent stuttering on 1080p high settings. It's terribly optimized. Sometimes even though I am looking at the ground (very few objects to render, theoretically low GPU load), my FPS still drops below 40. Then sparks and some other effects can cause the game to stutter and even freeze. Luckily, the game is still playable most of the time. For my friend, he find all the enemies invisible. Something is seriously wrong with their shader, rendering pipeline, or both. For me, performance is minor, the main deal breaker is EAC. EAC used to crash if you had 2-byte characters in you steam nickname. It has been addressed by the last patch, but some people are still experiencing crashes for other reasons. When it successfully launches, some people get falsely banned. I didn't have this issue with Elden Ring, but about 2 years ago, I was falsely banned by EAC in another game, which I refunded immediately. Maybe I had suspicious programs running, but I was never VAC banned for the VAC protected games. Banning honest players is just intolerable. Why does this game need anti-cheat after all? It's 95% single player & playing with friends, 4% online for messages&bloodstains, 1% PVP. Just do it like DS3, throw cheaters into a cheat server. Now for that 1% PVP content everyone needs to wait for EAC to initialize (~15 seconds for my setup), and some players CAN'T EVEN PLAY THE GAME. I am paying for Elden Ring, not EAC. Get rid of this trash so that I can recommend this game. Then it's the mouse&keyboard support issue. The game tries to move you camera ALL THE TIME. If you are playing with your mouse, you need to constantly move against it, and doing so will case your screen to jerk. I even suffered motion sickness playing this game. I never had any motion sickness playing first person games, even Portal. This game did. Why don't I use a controller? Because it doesn't recognize my controller input. And for keyboard. It simply maps controller buttons to keys. For button combinations, you will have to press the same combination on keyboard, rather than assigning its function to a single key. It was okay for DS3, but Elden Ring has more frequent use of button combinations. It's a real pain to remember and learn. I don't have much complain about the game, it's just PC optimization and Anti-Cheat. This review is written Feb/27/2022. The issues may be patched in the future.

Negative,"I wouldn't give this a thumbs up unless you like playing with controller. The game is simply does not have a good keyboard/mouse control implementation. I personally don't like controller based games. I just don't find them immersive or particularly enjoyable. Its like playing with chopsticks. I feel awkward and it ruins the immersion for me. This game does have keyboard support but it has so many issues that it isn't really viable unless the default keybindings work for you. Here are some of the issues that I had right out of the gate:- You can't rebind keys to some standard ascii keys. Like you can't rebind ""Forward"" to ""."" - No idea why but that means you can't use dvorak keyboards.- The entire intro and menus are designed to teach you to use controller. The icons are the xbox equivalent buttons so the double square button (whatever that icon means) is actually ""G"". Also you can't rebind that. Learning which key does what sometimes involves hitting all the keys to find one that works.- Same with menu navigation. E is ""select"" and Q is ""back"" - these are not rebindable, even if you rebind Q and E actions the new keys do not work in the menu.- Even when you rebind WASD, you can only control the map with WASD. So you really can't rebind WASD because you then can't use the map.- Many keys aren't rebindable (like the map) and even better there aren't defined anywhere as far as I can tell. ""G"" opens the map. I had to google it.- The whole targeting system is clearly designed for controller and isn't really optimal even in the default keybindings. But you can't really get creative with keybindings given the many issues involved with remapping keys.- Many moreI ended up using a third party app to help rebind keys, but I'm still having issues.This game looks pretty impressive, so its unfortunate to have all these issues. Like I said, if you like controller this review is probably not relevant. But if you're a KBM player that doesn't use the default keybindings, you're probably going to struggle.",0

Always fighting the auto follow camera, which in itself will induce motion sickness and headaches. The most unforgivable bit is that most, if not all, the issues would be simple fixes for the developers. I can only guess they have never used or tested a PC version or they couldn't be bothered, which is a slap in the face to every PC gamer out there.Multiplayer is just stupid and extremely annoying. There are so many UX issues it honestly feels like FromSoftware are trying to punish the player. When designing anything its always best practise to follow certain design affordances. Anyone who has played a PC game will use spacebar to jump and shift key to run. From Software decided Space is run and F is jump, wtf!The good news is the game design and game play, and once you have sorted out the controls, are really good but i'll be leaving the game unplayed until its been updated.",0

Negative,"Re-reviewing this game as since the last review, I've beaten the game, there was a DLC announced, and my friends have asked me to try playing this game again,The simple fact is I can't.Well not so much as I can't more so that I absolutely do not want to.This game has a lot of issues, but for the most part where all of it's issues even stem from, is the fact that this game is, whether you can stomach this truth or not, a cash grab. How? Well isn't obvious! We have all the hallmarks of modern AAA slop.First our open world, a lifeless slog, copy pasted dungeons, copy pasted mini bosses, what starts with the magnificent Limgrave making the attempt to fool you into believing the rest of the game will be like it, devolves into much of this sameness, even eventually going so far as to basically become corridors of terrain, that serve no more than to fill space between areas. Along the way of course like any good modern AAA slop you can pick up as many useless items to fill your inventory as you wish.Now they brought GRR Martin on to do the story for this game and beyond the open world this is the most obvious ploy to appeal to the unwashed masses. Dark Souls while known for it's lore is not particularly well known for it's story. No! you say to me, it's all about the story! The environmental storytelling yes, you are quite correct. Your Vaati vidya head canon as well does not count.Now in this world which is trying so very hard to pretend it isn't dark souls and grafting these mechanics onto it, thanks to our lovely writer GRR Martin we must be subject to as much convoluted side quests as From Software can muster in one game. Didn't understand Dark Souls quests before? You wont now. Nah dude for real looking up a guide isn't a good answer to this issue, a game shouldnt need a guide to complete anything key, and games can certainly be TOO convoluted as much as I despise AAA hand-holding.But now all of this as well sort of comes together to cause further issues, the game has cheapened so many aspects of what made Dark Souls good in order to appeal to a wider audience. We now have the option to summon different sorts of spirits from a typical souls phantom to aid you at any point in this game, Well known is for the ability for this to trivialise some fights due to their expendability and ability to absorb aggro. I avoided this mechanic. But similarly exists a mechanic I did not wish to avoid, but hopefully make much more use of. unfortunately in that regard co-op in this game is an awful experience, there are fog walls everywhere, and after defeating bosses, finding where you can even summon someone becomes difficult. I had wished to play this game co-op with my girlfriend when this game had released but it's a truly awful experience. In Dark Souls the amount of time one would ever have to spend playing by oneself was minimal, in Elden Ring this could take hours before you could be playing together again. I'm dissatisfied with the system. Even so a seamless co-op mod exists and while somewhat remedying this, is buggy in and of itself, and can ruin balancing in some cases.If we continue to ponder as to why the open world in Elden Ring is such a horrid experience we will find ourselves coming to the point which is that Dark Souls, specifically Demon Souls and Dark Souls 1. Are tightly crafted worlds and experiences where every item you find, every nook and cranny, every path you could take, is designed with the utmost care to add all the details that the average player may not notice on the conscious level but overall elevates this experience unlike anything else could. Dark Souls 1 while not an open world, may as well feel like one with it's deftly interwoven and branching paths, almost akin to a metroidvania. Providing a so much more rewarding experience, especially in a role playing game, than an open world could.Finally Elden Ring commits it's most egregious of sin, finding no meaningful way to elevate itself mechanically over any previous Souls Game. Sure they add jumping, sure they make weapon arts better but they were in DS3 too, sure they made it open world but it sucks, sure it has more of a story and it's written by a fat slob but that sucks too, sure the bosses are harder but they're overly gimmick, bloodborne-esque and evidence of From Software's lack of creativity, and yknow what the horse sucks. Then they hide this fact with an Open World, GRR Martin, and OMG AAA GFX!Like come on man, the build variety isn't even better than DS3. ""Oh but magic is good now!""Ok, and? Since DS3 any build that isn't a fast build is at an inherent disadvantage, since Bloodborne really all Souls-like games produced at FromSoft saw a shift in design towards fast paced gameplay over anything slow methodical and atmospheric, though certainly rolling and being fast was just as viable in the original games, but being heavy in this game. ha.It's a sort of plague on FromSoft design lately generally, as much as I loved Armored Core 6, it has the Bloodborne-itis itself.So I don't like Elden Ring, call me bad, I beat the game, I've beaten Dark Souls 1 and 2 the first time around solo with no multiplayer summons so whatever dude.",0
Negative,"I would like to start of by saying that Elden Ring is not a bad game by any means, in fact, it feels quite grotesque to rate a game simply by the medium of a thumbs up or thumbs down, because there is so much to say about what the game does right and badly. But I feel like its necessary to counter some of the overall positivity of the game and reviews that were done when the game just came out.Having played the game for almost 70 hours and nearing the end, this means that I have played on average roughly a little less of an hour everyday since its release date. Therefore, I think that I am in a good position to put out a review. I think this game is one of the greatest examples of honeymoon phase, meaning that when the game came out, alike many people, I was genuinely mind boggled at how incredible the game is, and I would ve easily rated my first 20+ hours of playing it a 10-9/10 score. Limgrave feels fantastic, I wanted to explore every nook and cranny. Caelid felt like this barren scary Mordor esque that you couldn t resist trying to enter early on despite the difficulty curve. And the scenery when you first enter Liurnia of the lakes and you see the Castle/Academy of Lucaria is actualy jaw-dropping. Once you reach the boss of Queen Renalla at the Academy, this is where I feel like the game severely drops in quality. It doesn t drop in quality because the environments and the later portion of the game necesserely suck (except the Mountain Top of Giants, it actually is just bad and boring), but more so because all the design faults and issue start really sticking out as you realize that the rest of the game is more so of the same. Here are my main gripes with the game:-Boss balancing issues:This is honestly the biggest problem with the game, and most of people s criticism. As VideoGameDunkey perfectly describes it, the difficulty in this game is total f_king horses_t . But before all the Souls stan come out raging saying GITGUD , let me clarify that I have played 2 Souls game before, but this one feels totally unfair for game design issues, not because I suck, even thought I might suck sometimes. In other souls game, when I lost against a boss, it felt like I did because I was just being bad, and that I needed to learn how to counter, parry, and understand the boss mechanic, and it was so gratifying to eventually defeat them. The thing about Elden Ring is that so many of those encounters feel like such a slog, and that the bosses can one shot you with some of the most bullshit attacks, and that the only way to counter that is not per say by getting good , but more so by cheesing your way out or using an obscure item that renders the boss defenseless. One of the main mechanic that Miyazaki introduces is the Tear of Ashes summons, where you can summon minions to fight by your side, they are legitimately a game changer and have to be used against bosses, like you literally have to. Except that it feels like such a cheap mechanic and they act more so as damage sponge more than anything else, and the technicality of fighting bosses from previous Souls game feels thrown out of the window in exchange for this. It just feels so cheap, and im telling you, the bosses in this game are so sub-par compared to previous souls game, especially in the later parts of the game.-Common enemies, unbalanced rewards:Apart from the bosses, the normal enemies have horrible balancing issues, once you get to the later parts of the game, Leyndell capital feels genuinely pretty easy, the enemies that you kill give you a ton of souls for being relatively easy (trumpet people) whilst some enemies in other locations such as Caelid or some underground areas have genuinely much harder enemies that give out barely any souls, it makes no sense, why the bother then? Once you go from Leyndell to the Mountain tops of Giants (weakest and final part of the game pretty much), the difficulty curve gets RIDICULOUSLY hard almost instantly, enemies will one shot you despite your enormous health bar, and forget about the bosses with the most bullshit and unavoidable attacks, you need to cheese your way out even more.The balancing isn t from just the enemies, but from your starting class and the skills that you choose to upgrade. I went for a Strength based character, and from my understanding and talking to other people, choosing a mage like character or a high dexterity character makes the game significantly easier. 1.5: The pointlessness of exploration: this sortoff is related to my previous point about balancing issues. But so much of the exploration in this game feels pointless, as all the weapons that you discover on your way are usable on only a set of specific skills. So for example you can go through a whole dungeon in a game in the hope of getting a great weapon, only for it to be intelligence based although you ve been using intelligence the whole game. So I would say that a good 80% to 90% (and I am not exaggerating) of items that you discover are legitimately useless from the get go. If you are looking for a kind of Skyrim esque game or a casual RPG, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME, I knew what I was getting into having played previous Souls game. But my god, despite this, so much of this unexplained to the player. There is no way you can go through this game without consulting a wiki page or some kind of help online, and this isn t cool or obscure in a good way. It simply is just bad game design by the developers. Most newcomers would assume that the way to get better is by continuing to find weapons, when in reality, you can legitimately find an early weapon and grind it and smith it to the max until the end game portion, but this isn t necessarily obvious to a newcomer. Tools such as the Tears of Ashes (summons) can be upgraded to be significantly better, and you simply cannot go through the whole game without activating it, but the process of doing it is legitimately impossible to do without some kind of guide, and this brings us to the next part.Souls games previously were relatively linear, this meant if there was some side quest, the character that you came across generally reappeared or were generally hard to miss. But even so, some could actually be missed because there was no specific quest headline in traditional RPG, so you had to operate through clues and item descriptions, which could be a little hassle as some of the later souls game such as 3, were much more semi-open like linear games. Now imagine the exact same mechanic but in a huge spawling world that it much much bigger than skyrim. Now it gets completely stupid. I can tell with confidence that probably 95% or 98% of people competing the side quests had to do it thanks to wikis and youtube videos.One sidequests consists in helping Roderika (or whatever her name is) in her mission to finally be able to unlock the ability to upgrade summons. It's so easy to miss this mission, and I can guarantee that doing so would make the game 10 times harder than it needs to be.Once you get past the honeymoon phase of the game, you ll start noticing that a lot of enemies are actually reskinned enemies with slight deviations. This isn t necessarily bad, because there is a huge range of variety of enemies in the first place, but there is a ton of boss reskins as well, which really felt unnecessary. Shockingly, one main story boss (Margit) actually gets recycled into just a harder version of itself (Morgott), the only reskinned being a new knife That genuinely felt pretty lazy.Again, this review aimed to counter all the positives with the negatives, I still think that Elden Ring is a good game, but man does it really drop in quality once past a certain moment in the story .",0
Negative,1. I couldn't possibly recommend Elden Ring in its current state. This is one of the most poorly optimised AAA releases I've ever played and I played Cyberpunk 2077 at launch. This game wasn't ready for release and its performance reflects that. 2. This game is Dark Souls + open world + horse + jump button. If you weren't enamoured with the Dark Souls series - for whatever reason - then I doubt that Elden Ring has much to offer.,0
Negative,"BUYER BEWARE! This is very serious!My friends have been banned from online play for various reasons such as due to repeated irregular terminations of multiplayer sessions- when its just the game fucking crashing because its an unstable piece of shit. Or like getting a soft ban and being unable to play because they picked up an item or was invaded by a cheater, ive even heard of worse stories starting to surface. SERIOUSLY! The game has an insane amount of problems, especially with online play. If you plan to spend a ton of time on this game ""ONLINE""- just buy it for new gen console and hope to god you don't get banned-edit with more time on pc ive had my system completely freeze up and be unresponsive making me have to hard shut it off. cant wait for this buggy and unstable rushed project with a shitty anti cheat to kill my pc for good. dont buy this game until they fix the crashing and stability issues for the liurnia area (water area)",0
Negative,"Worse than dark souls 3. Boss designs get more and more ridiculous as the game goes on, still a very long load between death and getting to the bosses, and instakills even when maxed out health and armor. Too much filler content, just to say it s open world.I ll still play it, but it s not worth buying.",0
Negative,"*REVIEW FROM A FIRST TIME SOULS-LIKE PLAYER*I will start with my conclusion first. I do not recommend this game for people like me, who have never played this genre before. Try your hand at cheaper titles to see if this torturous headache is your type of game.I will now go into detail on just how INACCESSIBLE and RIDICULOUS this game is:GUIDANCE: ""An Epic Drama Born from a MythA multilayered story told in fragments. An epic drama in which the various thoughts of the characters intersect in the Lands Between."" - FromSoftwareIt took me 3 hours to actively figure out how to read the damn map pointers. The game refuses to guide you. Roads mean nothing as the go miles away from the POI. I spent hours lost in the open world (partially due to the beautiful graphics.). Getting totally destroyed by creatures way above my level. I don't need a level counter, I don't need some arbitrary numbers saying ""Hey, you can maybe survive here"". Put an invisible wall in. The game can tell me that I am not ready and that I suck, without making me waste hours on bosses I can't even touch. On startup with a fresh character, you are greeted with a hallway, that turns into a forked path. that then turns into the open world. This is totally fine. if the entire community was not actively against you and trying to get you to stare a wall for 20 mins, or jump off a cliff. As humorous as this is, and I fell for it and laughed a few times. It exemplifies how elitist this community is. And for new players like me who sometimes needs a signpost or something, I get trolling. Thanks for the help guys. I remember seeing the first elevator, and there was A LEVER right next to it. 99/100 times this says ""Pull lever to continue"". But in this stupid game, the Lever does nothing. WHY EVEN PUT IT THERE!?!?! And every troll put a sign on it so I had to cycle through tons of DERP to finally notice it does nothing.Generally story is what spurs the character to the next task/objective. But these characters are so boring and long winded that I couldn't give a damn what they are saying. If they said anything about ""Go, here!"" I totally missed it while they droned on about nothing.I found a cooperator for the Margit fight and thought ""Oh hey a kind player, that wants to help newbs like me!"" After 1 hour I finally figured out that it was a NPC and I felt stupid for feeling like I wasted a guys hour dying to Margit. No help, or tip or FAIRY screaming ""HEY! LOOK! YOU MAY NOT BE FAMILIAR WITH THIS.""CONTROLS: These controls are TERRIBLE! Directional combat is not existent. MAKE SURE YOU TARGET YOUR TARGET. What a dumb decision. While getting my a** pushed in I need to remember to put my SUPER-WISP on the target or I cannot hit them. Everything is sluggish, which is so strange when timing is everything in this game. Telegraphing in combat is a chore and hardly works. Stance-breaking and other intermediate combat is so poorly described I don't think it is even applicable. In a game that screams ""Figure it out dumb-dumb"", everything is working against you to the point of ""Why even bother?"". OH and don't bother button mashing. Every action is queued, so if you hit the attack button 4 times you better be satisfied with swinging 4 times and doing nothing else. It's like a really crappy KOTOR where the enemy is real time fighting and you are stuck on turn based.COMBAT: WHY DOES THE BOSS HAVE AN INVULNERABLE ""STANCE RESET"" AND I DON'T? I died over 50 times to Margit alone. The amount of time he stood up from my onslaught INVULNERABLE is unforgivable. I WAS SKILLED ENOUGH TO BEAT HIM, YOU JERKS SCREWED ME! Why is there no staggering blows? Would that be ""Too easy""? WHY DO I STAGGER THEN!?!?! I don't want equality from boss fights, but give me a goddamn chance on the first boss that I MUST FIGHT. Stance breaking is useless, you might as well just say that random chance will give you the epic hit. I tried everything. Different weapons, different stances, different skills. No trends formed. Nothing for me to learn on what I was doing wrong. Just dead, dead, dead, dead, dead, dead. (Don't talk to me about shackles. Nothing in this game even points to the idea that items exist for boss fights. Again, inexcusable.)This game is beautiful. The models are very nice, I didn't see many areas where textures mesh weird or odd ragdolling. This took a lot of effort and the Devs should feel great about their product. But you are actively making this game not-playable for new players. And that is kind of a gaming SIN. I will keep trying, but all joy I had in playing this with friends, seriously trying to do something difficult, and leaving my gaming comfort zone is totally beaten down by your team's decision to make me feel like an idiot. AND NOT IN A GOOD WAY!Oh and one of my biggest issues. WHAT GAME LETS YOU DRINK A POTION IF YOU ARE FULL HEALTH!?!?!?! Better yet, WHAT KIND OF GAME MAKES THE POTION BUTTON THE SAME AS ALL ITEMS!?!?!?! Who's idea was that!?!?!",0
Negative,"Poorly written ""Open World""",0
Negative,My first steam review.The spirit bell disappeared mid-game. Can't get a new one. Lots of freezes in the game make fighting stuff hard. Friend can't even play because the game is not rendering enemies properly.,0
Negative,Game doesn't run well. Keeps crashing. Of course no refund from steam.,0
Negative,dark souls three is way better tbh. the pvp in this game is cancerous and honestly not fun. hopefully from will bring back ds3 servers soon because this is SHIT,0
Negative,Cannot pet the dog.,0
Negative,seems fun so far but wtf with the constant freezing even in the middle of boss fights will change once they fix it wild it got released with so many freezing/crash issues will return the game maybe in a year theyll have it fixed wild we cant expect a working game on release date anymore (its asking for an update so update still freezing all the time),0
Negative,"The tutorial was amazing, but with my 2017 computer, the overworld was immensely laggy and there were black lines appearing across the screen. I advise that PC players with a 2020 desktop or older hold off until this game is further optimized.",0
Negative,"No ultrawide support despite no option to render a normal aspect ratio, wasted performance for no reason? Stuttering and horrible lack of accessibility options like change text size. Literally would ve taken no dev time, why from soft so bad at pc ports.",0
Negative,"One of the best games ever made in terms of design, art direction, lore and world building. The combat shares alot of it's DNA with Demon's Souls - the game that invented the sub-genre - and Dark Souls - the game that brought the sub-genre to the masses, but you can clearly see that it has been iterated on and improved game by game, culminating in the most diverse combat in a souls game to date.I really could talk about how this game pushes almost every aspect to it's peak. However, after much thought and deliberation - I am going to have to give the game a ""not recommended"" review, to be clear, I would absolutely recommend the game to anyone into souls likes or RPGs. However, considering the sheer number of Elden Ring copies sold and therefore the massive amount of revenue / profit From Software would have received from both Elden Ring and it's recently released DLC (I'm looking at a report saying that 5 million units of the DLC have been sold). I simply cannot look past the incredibly outdated technical presentation, the game is still locked at 60 fps, the game still has a huge amount of stutter issues and still drops frames below 60 fps even on a more than capable machine. They should use a comparatively very small portion of their profits to reinvest in their technology, hire a team to focus on getting the performance up to what the industry expects in 2024.There isn't much I can do to get this message across and so I thought putting a ""not recommended"" review is about the only thing I can do outside of not buying the game / DLC.",0
Negative,No ultrawide support and 60fps locked . Modders fixed the issue but then online play is not possible.Refund for me.,0
Negative,we need dx11 support,0
Negative,"A simple preface, I LOVED Elden Ring, and has completed pretty much all From's SoulsBorne, and many souls like. I think its a beautiful game to play, to experience, to explore with an art direction unmatched by most AAA titles. However, come the DLC, the game performance is now pretty much straight dogshit. The game has huge performance issues since day 1, and the DLC somehow made it worse (yes, even the base game performance somehow got worse). If you played any PC Dark Souls at launch, you know they all have varied performance issues, but Elden Ring is the first to get to completely unplayable at points. In the same castle, you can get wildly different performance from one corner to another. Sometimes even moving the camera seems daunting. This wouldn't be much of an issue if Elden Ring wasn't an action game that required precise reaction. Imagine at least 20+ frame drops, or even sudden freezing, when you tried to dodge all the fireworks the bosses spits out. It's insulting that the latest patch ""recommend"" absolutely nothing, and blamed the consumer for all this.Wait, for a patch, or wait for community mods to make the game playable. Hell, go sail the high sea first just to see if you can play the game normally.",0
Negative,"Amazing visuals and sound design! Never played a souls-like game before, so I decided to give it a shot for a couple of reasons. First reason was from people who said that those who were on the fence should pick it up and the second reason being the ratings. Everyone seems to love it, so it sounds like an amazing purchase! I don't usually listen to the general public and game critics about game recommendations, and now I remember why. It's a great game ruined by mediocre game mechanics that is difficult for the sake of being difficult. If I wanted to do something that was difficult due to how tedious it is, I'd go do my accounting homework. At least I could get a few job prospects out of an accounting degree, not to mention that I could get it done in half the time it would take to beat this game.",0
Negative,"From a PVP standpoint this game is absolute disrespectful trash, I cannot believe how many things they just completely fucked up, downgraded and ruined. No amount of patches will solve the underlying gutted core systems/philosophies.Patches will certainly help make this games pvp a much better experience though, no doubt.just nowhere near where it SHOULD beadd insult to injury bandai has been silent for like 3 months about the entire souls catalogue servers being offline, so i cant even go play better pvp content if i wanted toregardless this game is really hard to enjoy if you want to main pvp, I've also noticed that the community is the most toxic its ever been and ive been here since ds1 release daysIf Bandai could just do me a solid and release dedicated servers ONLY for the arena dlc, i would look over all this games huge flaws just for a taste of that reliable netcode",0
Negative,"The developers seem to have almost not considered keyboard and mouse at all when making this game. Certain controls are hardcoded and can't be changed. Moving your mouse from left to right is hardcoded to change your targeted enemy, which you can imagine makes certain boss fights much harder than they need to be when you lock onto a random enemy in the distance. Why this is the state of keyboard and mouse support on the game's release is beyond me.",0
Negative,"Absolute gem of a console game(maybe), absolute trash pc game. Forced capped at 60 fps, the frame stuttering is the worst I have ever experienced, and I have a top gaming rig with a RX 6700 XT and it stutters from 60 fps to 15 for no reason, max graphics or absolute minimum. Graphics wise is mediocre. Probably looks top for a console, not up to latest pc graphic games. This is one of, if not the worst console port I have ever seen. Literally the only consideration for pc players is adding keyboard and mouse support. 0/10 for a pc gamer.",0
Negative,"Struggling to maintain 60FPS/1080p on a 3080, massive stuttering and drops to the mid 20s, crashed 4 times within 2 hours of game time, 60 FPS cap, and no ultrawide support.On top of all that, Easy-Anti cheat will prevent any unofficial fixes or mods for this game, even when playing offline.This is unacceptable.",0
Negative,"I was genuinely excited for this game, I've been a dark souls fan for about a decade. Sadly though the complete lack of structure elden ring has compared to previous titles kills it for me. I wandered around the open world for tens of hours, beating dozens of bosses, only to learn after story guides finally came out online that nearly everything had been optional and hadn't built to anything other than glorified grinding. Having already sunk so much time into the game getting nowhere I'd grown bored of it and couldn't be bothered to complete it. Truly a shame.I doubt this review will ever reach the devs but on the chance that it does, if you're going to add so many optional bosses, please add some kind of boss list to the map menu that defines which ones are actually important to progress and which ones are filler. I don't think this will break the integrity of the game's difficulty. Adding vague arrows on the sites of graces just wasn't enough.EDIT: 5 months after launch I decided to reinstall the game, see what updates have been made and really try to beat it now that the wikis have been populated with info. 15 hours later I now passionately hate this game and I've realised even more of it's blatant regressions over previous soulsborne titles. I genuinely felt like my run was softlocked when to progress the game required me to grind for 50 levels to get to the recommended level range of the area I needed to go to progress the main story (which remember is never explained in game), which would mean at least a dozen hours of doing mindless killing and upgrading my weapon wouldn't work either since I'd already gone to the highest tier I could with the stones I could find (yes even using guides). Enemy reuse is rampant, grinding might not've been so bad if I had to fight varied enemies with unique movesets but no this game will happily copy paste the same giants, tree guardians and soldiers at you just with altered stats to feign a rise in difficulty. The soundtrack to underline all that isn't even good, sorry to the composer but it honestly sounds like someone passed out on a MIDI keyboard with the violin soundfont on with how droning and boring it is. Nor is exploring the world encouraged when you have to do it with a horse that feels ripped right out of skyrim with how it awkwardly climbs up the terrain, except in that game it was a bug in this game they actually want you to do that as a feature.What a goddamn travesty of a video game honestly. Dark Souls is one of my favourite series in gaming, my anger isn't coming from a place of not understanding the formula or a ""lack of skill"". My playtime oughta show I went the distance with trying to extend an olive branch with it. This is just not made with nearly as much consideration as previous games to give you a tight and impactful experience. This is a lazy attempt to jump on the bandwagon of ""open worlds"" and ""hundreds of hours of playtime"" but without evolving the formula built for short linear metroidvanias enough to justify any of that. It'll annoy me to no end that this game will probably get game of the year and a wave of new fans will herald it as the greatest thing ever meaning Fromsoft probably won't fix any of this crap and future games will be just as wonky. If that's the case then fine, let the people who enjoy this game enjoy it, but as a fan for over 10 years I'm out.",0
Negative,great game but would love to play it for more than an hour without it crashing,0
Negative,"I paid full price for a game with stellar reviews. What I got was constant stuttering, frame drops and controller inputs not recognising. Seriously sick of this nonsense from major companies.",0
Negative,"Oh boy, I've no idea where to start so let's begin, shall we?First of all, back in the days I was enchanted by DS3 so it goes without saying that I had been waiting for this game and had been mildly hyped for a while.The good part of the game is that it retained the same atmosphere and dark fantasy vibe the DS3 captured me with, so it felt like another DS game, which I had really wanted. I guess it's pretty much about it?Moving forward to the dark side of the moon, I can't really recommend it to anyone who wants a DS game but not a God of War-like content experience. Allow me to explain. Just like in God of War (for me it's a prime example of lack of budget or just laziness of the devs), you encounter tons of copy-pasted content, when the managers forgot they are not programmers and can't just copy-paste everything and it will magically work. When I say ""tons"" I mean like pretty much more than half of the game is copy pasted. Found a pretty unique looking boss in the game? Okay, how about to meet him 5 times more as just a pretty tough monster (but not as a boss) and then meet him again as ANOTHER BOSS with just another name, but everything else is exactly as you remember. This happens A LOT in the game, even more often than when your parents tell you you're a disappointment.Okay okay, what about the open world? Before the game came out I had read a little article by someone who got the game earlier and they said the open world had been quite empty. BUT, who the hell trusts those reviews anyways, am I right? Having spent around 60h in the game I can say, oh boy was that person right. The open world feels dull and unrewarding, most of the time just not worth the hassle. You just run around for hours to realize that ""oh okay, this area is too high lvl for me"" or ""oh, I just 2 shot the boss, I probably should have came here much earlier"". So idk who came up with this, but hear me out: it's NOT FUN. Nothing can be more frustrating than discovering a cave with some bosses whom someone spent hours designing and animating only to kill them with 3 hits cuz they are too weak for you now anyways.What about the contents the open world? Well, you can stumble on some catacombs and find some churches here and there, some points of interests etc.(read: copy-pasted catacombs, churches and pretty much anything). Will they give you something useful? - Maybe, rarely, up to you to decide what's useful for you. Bosses in catacombs are also copy-pasted, Idk at this point this should be incapsulated in any point about this game that I say.I can probably talk for hours about what's wrong with this game. My disappointment is second to nothing, the quality has dropped immensely, as though they had hired someone from Ubisoft or EA to handle this project.I really wanted to like this game, but I can't support such quality drop.",0
Negative,shitte gaem no buy,0
Negative,Terrible PC port. Won't launch even after multiple (recommended) attempts to fix,0
Negative,"After 2 playthroughs killing every major boss, I can safely say this game feels unfinished and unpolished.TL:DR = Too much annoyence , too many things missing from older souls, combat pacing is a weird mix and bosses are just reading your inputs + have annoying mechanics to be hard for sake of being hard.To start , your character feels way slower than in DS3, recoveries seem to be longer too, your dodge roll is much weaker. All these woudlnt be such a problem, however, this game bosses move extremly fast towards the end, making you feel like you are playing DS2 whilst they are from Sekiro.Open world aspect feels empty. Sure you do find some random caves which have cool loot, how ever problem is that getting from A to B is boring. There is nothing happening in between. Enemies are same old re used, giants pulling one chest is just there to seem like world is ""moving"" when its not. Weapons have also recieved some changes, the ash of war system I think is great, making you pick what attack you want with what scaling let it be dex, str or even magic. The downside is that you can only put those on normal weapons and some of them feel extremly underwhelming as is compared to something like a Bloodhound step that is basically a better quickstep. Bosses are suppoused to be a hilight in every Fromsoft game, not in this one.Every dungeon boss is a repurposed normal overworld enemy. Even a quest specific boss can be found in a random mine just chilling. Main bosses are weird. In the start all feel pretty good, they offer a good chalange for which you can level or overlevel to beat them, their move are well paced , some speedy moves to make you roll, some slow moves to make you think. First half is generally pretty good. But the second half is unbearable, Bosses go from feeling like a boss , to feel like a Sekiro / Bloodborne boss. Extremly fast, high damage with simple swings, attacks that just hit all around them. It feels like they forgot to balance the bosses corretly for how the game and your character are paced. Game is lacking boss rush modes from Sekiro, better NG+ rewards from older DS and the NG cycles them selfs are terribly scaled, with quarter and a half game you are oneshotting, and last quarter you are getting oneshot.All and all, this game needs a lot of updates to make it the ""Best from soft game"" at best its a 7/10, at worst its a 6/10.",0
Negative,"TL;DR: You died.Full reviewThe GoodElden Ring is an open world, with stunning landscapes. It has beautiful effects, and intricate detail. The realm is huge; it truly feels vast. You feel like a tiny R ckenfigur in a Friedrich painting. The sounds are good and add well to the ambience. The soundtrack is excellent.I cannot overstate the extreme detail. In the enormity of the realm, there are truly minute graphical depictions such as small shells, tiny writings, book bindings, nuances on characters. In fact, it is a pity that you are too busy fighting for your life to take in the rich minutiae.The environment is (generally) consistent. Some people call this ""environmental story telling"", although I disagree. it is not telling the story, but it is definitely self-affirming with the setting.The combat is okay with mechanics that are rich, consistent and (mostly) solid. There are lots of different enemies, with their different behaviours, moves and abilities. As a result, a variety of tactics are needed. You don't just spam the same thing over and over. Additionally, there is no ""single build"" that will dominate the game. Instead there are a variety of alternatives, giving options for different playstyles. Personally, I played it as a astrologer (= spell-caster), with no armour, a magic staff and lots of sorceries. I played it as a ""Mind+Intelligence build"" and managed to complete the game in its entirety.There is a huge variety of items, with a collection of self-consistent themes.The game engine is rock solid. I never had a single glitch or crash in many hundreds of hours of thorough gameplay.The BadElden Ring was voted Game of the year, with the emphasis on game. It is a fantasy combat game. Not a role-playing experience, adventure quest or saga. There is no coherent narrative and it is story-poor. Yes, there is a setting and some lore, but it is inconsistent, nonsensical and difficult to comprehend.Instead, it is a gamerz game where you are expected to cheese the game and play the meta. Some bosses are defeated by finding the cheese-spot (and by cheese, I mean a tactic or location, that you can exploit but which is not particularly realistic or it somehow glitches the AI). You will learn about leash points and aggro points. You will need the wiki. You will need online videos.There are no hints (apart from some very fragmented dialogue and some ghost characters). This is in an environment which is deadly and punishing, so you end up being too cautious to explore or try things. And all this spoils the immersion. it becomes difficult to suspend disbelief and engross yourself in the world, when you are constantly alt-tabbing out to find out how to proceed to the next room without getting slaughtered.Otherwise you end up playing the game thrice. Once to discover a danger area (you died, without warning). Twice to learn/observe the moves/attacks of the enemy (you still died, but you know why now). And then a third time, this time forewarned and forearmed to stand a chance of winning. This gets tedious.There are a lot of gamey features too. Creatures de-/re-spawn on resting. Bosses are in cloud-shrouded rooms. Major bosses are always double-phase fights, with cringe-worthy mid-fight cut-scenes. And there are some very unrealistic things: inertia and moment-of-inertia seems to be arbitrary. There are mega-weapons which would clearly weigh many times that of the character, but which can be flicked about with ease. You can walk on liquid lava with minimal damage (let alone sinking into it). There is insane vertical exaggeration with ladders many 10s of metres tall. There are some odd platforming jumps (eg. onto wet, sloped surfaces). You can snipe one enemy, and the one right next to it remains passive. The list goes on and on. Sure, I know it is fantasy, but it is downright silly in some places.Also, I didn't enjoy multiplayer. I found the other ghosts and messages of other players really distracting, so I turned them off very quickly. Player-vs-player arena matches are dominated by absurd min-max builds (eg. semi-naked characters doing insane jump-attacks with 2-tonne colossal weapons). And, the multiplayer scene is spoiled by the usual flood of toxic, noxious, obscene and trollish behaviour from immature players.The game is story-poor. Some may argue that it is rich, but I disagree. The environment is rich, but the narrative, the progress and the involvement are poor. For a world filled with characters, the interactions with them are pathetic. You cannot ask questions. And of the all the studies and libraries, you cannot pick up a single book. The world is festooned with carvings and writings that you cannot read. The background ""story"" is a mish-mash collection of exaggerated tropes, awkwardly hacked together. By the time I got to the end of it, I still had little idea what was going on or what the purpose was. The finale was extremely weak. merely a string of non-sequitur combats, with no sense of continuity, let alone closure. Some may say that there are some amazing lore videos on Elden Ring. True. but this is a review of the game, not the lore videos, which themselves are merely speculation and conjecture. Oh. and a pet hate. Grammar errors. There are lots of grammatical errors in the dialogue. Especially in places where they try to use the archaic second person. Thou-thee-thy-thine are butchered. An occasional mistake is one thing, but it was endemic. Likewise for the horrid handling of had-have-hath-hast. Et cetera.The Lands BetweenAnd then there are some things that are neither good nor bad, but I feel are worth mentioning.It is difficult, but not impossibly so. I am not a particularly good gamer, but I managed to complete the game and get all the achievements. I did this as an astrologer character (supposedly difficult) and using keyboard and mouse (not controller; and controller is reputedly easier). There were occasions where I needed to move on and come back to an area later when I was stronger. And there were many instances when I really needed to research and plan my tactics offline to work out how to defeat a certain boss. And, as mentioned, I consulted the Internet on numerous occasions to figure out what was needed, or how to proceed.And, Elden Ring is grim.The world is bleak, with ongoing war. There are depictions of depravity, self harm, torture and death. One boss is surrounded by children minions that you must slay. There are many vile scenes filled with disease, rot and vast mounds of bodies. Although there is no smell, the stench of decay permeates this game. You are called ""tarnished"" and you are very alone, haunted by your own frailty and vulnerability, and often accompanied by painful, mournful sounds. You have few allies, you cannot mend or build the world. You are mostly without hope.If in real-life you are despondent, depressed or otherwise feeling down, I would strongly recommend that you stay away from this game.ConclusionElden Ring is a work of modern art. But the sort of art that leaves you simultaneously impressed by its detail and craftsmanship, as it leaves you baffled by what it might actually mean.Elden Ring was Game of the Year, with the emphasis on Game. Do not expect compelling narrative or deep immersion. You will learn cheese. And you will only figure out the story via the online walkthrough FAQs.Elden Ring is bleak, filled with scenes of intense depravity, self harm, torture and hopelessness. Be wary of staring into the abyss.Is it a masterpiece? - Perhaps.But would I recommend it to others? - No, I do not.",0
Negative,It might be ok on a console but it is unplayable with a keyboard. Everything defaults to am xbox controller and even after I changed it all to a keyboard things did not work. I got into one menu and had to shut down the program because I could not get out of it with out a controller.WASTE OF MONEY,0
Negative,"Horribly optimized, bug-ridden, unfocused, console port that gets praise for design decisions meant to restrict information from the player and omits standard gameplay systems. Similar to previous entries, the story is still presented in vague and obtuse platitudes meant to sound deeper than it actually is. Which, when combined with the lack of an in-game dialogue journal, meant I had little reason to remember or care.The lack of an in-game quest log (not to be confused with markers, which I don't like) meant I had to track write down quest details outside of the game. Which renders its omission completely pointless. This could've been helped by an in-game dialogue journal, that I could circle back to, but alas. see point above. There are mods to address this, but that is a bandaid.For a game that the designers meant to push a feeling of ""exploration"" and ""discovery"", the vast majority of the ""discoveries"" that a player will make are simply more combat encounters to acquire loot and mats to move onto different combat encounters. To which, the majority of players will simply follow guides and remove any ""sense of wonder"" that the creators were going for. Combat feels sluggish/delayed due to animation locks and actions being tied to button releases instead of press. Hit boxes are either bugged or, somehow, meant to allow for damage to be taken when the models clearly missed and missed when the models collide. iFrames are wildly inconsistent, with jumping be a better choice of action for literally any ground or horizontal attack.The world feels empty and devoid of purpose outside of being there to make the player travel between dungeons. The UI, similar to previous entries, is poorly designed and cumbersome to navigate, Graphics are muddy and set pieces are forgettable. Additionally, the game suffers from performance issues and LITERALLY the worst open world camera I've ever encountered. Even with a mod to remove the auto-centering, I constantly was fighting just to point the camera where I wanted to. Both micro and macro-stuttering occur constantly despite updating drivers and other online researched fixes.I can't imagine how this game gets so much praise but I'm glad it resonated with some people. I'm not one of those people though.",0
Negative,"Lack of weapon balance makes this game incredibly dull. You want to use daggers? Too bad they're not even close to meta, you want to use a normal warpick? Too bad it's not even close to meta. The broken weapons are so broken that the game is catered to them and every other weapon falls by the wayside. Games fun but balance is worse that overwatch. there's a reason why every streamer or content creator uses the same five weapons or sorceries.",0

Negative,"Copy-paste Souls. Beautiful on the surface, repetitive, diluted slog underneath with gank fights aplenty, unbalanced mechanics, inconsistent music, and half-hearted everything.

Negative,"the start of the game was fun, but then as things expanded it began to get rather boring with no real idea as to what to do without guides.others probably found it a lot easier, or even compelling to deal with that.but personally it just got a bit boring to either wander around aimlessly and find hardly anything, or look up a guide on how to complete a quest because its directions are too vague at times.",0
Negative,"Really disappointing how this game is a masterpiece for 60 hours and then falls off so hard for the third chapter, that it ruins the experience. Easily my favorite visuals from Fromsoft, I love all the adjustments to previous mechanics from DS3. And I think they handled the open world structure really well. Everything falls apart when they start repeating bosses 5-7 times, and the damage scaling becomes completely unfair.The first half of the game teaches the player over and over that if they're having a difficult time, they can come back later when they're higher level, and can output higher damage to make it easier for themselves. This was a great refresh to the linear structure of previous titles, and it allowed incredible freedom in how I could tackle the world. But because of the cost of upgrading gets higher, and the soft cap limits on stats, the options given to me for the whole game are taken away.I am just an average player. I went into this game like any other Fromsoft game wanting to play-through with my specific strength build I had in mind. When I hit the aforementioned wall of difficulty, my maxed out strength build with +10 colossal weapons hit like wet paper. I have huge respect for the players that can play-through these games with a broken straight sword, but I don't want that level of difficulty as an average player. And I don't think its fair to push it on the standard playerbase.By the end of the game I felt like I was funneled into one of the 5 different broken weapon builds and like I was forced into restating just to have a good chance of getting through the game. My favorite feature of the these games was working my way through the whole game painfully but steadily to become a god worth contending with the final boss. This game doesn't do that. By the end I feel like an ant that managed the give a god a paper cut that led to a bad infection which eventually led to their demise. I feel nothing by completing this.",0
Negative,"The more I played after Morgott, the more I felt like Miyazaki is running out of ideas/time and makes things not complex and not hard, but just unfair. But I've managed to get to Farum Azula and even beat Godskin Duo, so I think, I can say some things 'bout this game.Whole game is not as well-balanced as it has always been in Soulsbornekiro series: From the start of the game the balance is quite good and almost fair, but right after the Capital the game brings no more fun.The damage gets insane, movesets of certain enemies leave you no other choice but to ignore them and by getting to Farrum Azula, I started thinking: 'Why am I actually playing this game?' It brings no fun, It gives you no reward.And I can tell you, that most of this because game actually TRIES to bring more difficulty, but not with good gamedesign and balance, but with simple increasing of damage/number of enemies on area/Movesets of enemies.The great thing of DS and BB was that there used to be simple principle in combining HP, attack and animation of enemies:If enemy deals great damage, moves fast, he doesn't have a ton of HP.If enemy is tanky, deals great damage he is slow- his attacks are easy to predict.If enemy jumps from one corner to another, has great hp, he doesn't deal much damage per hit.And so on.But in this game all these princeples are gone. It's not fun fighting Malekith. His moveset is an unstoppable combo, that I cannot dodge. It was not fun to kill Godskin Duo. Malenia's moveset is just not from this game, I believe. It would be a cool boss for Sekiro's DLC, but it got here. Malekith's moveset is like from Bloodborne, but got here.The last 50 hours or so I felt like not winnig against the opponent I respect, I felt more like cleaning the house from my dog's poo.I'm very disappointed in you, Miyazaki. You used to make fair games. But this one feels unfair most of the time.",0

Negative,I can tell there's an incredible game here but I can't recommend it to PC players in it's current state.Took 3 hours of screwing around for it to recognise my controller.Constant frame rate drops regardless of what settings I use.Invisible enemies.Invisible mount.It really feels like another sloppy PC port of a console game. Very disappointed because I really want to get into it and enjoy it but the issues make it almost unplayable. I've gone through all the currently available advice both here and on reddit. nothings working even on low settings.(RTX 2070),0
Negative,"The game feels great. The combat is good and game interactions are interesting but as a keyboard and mouse player the game feels like it wasn't made for me. There are a lot of little things that just make this game bad. A lot of the problems that I have experienced are keyboard related, So if you want to play this game get a controller. The game just doesn't work for keyboard, they don't tell you what the button for the map is and you cant change it from g to anything. Also there is a lot of frame drops. Also you cant use the buttons on your mouse for any key bind. Also default controls for keyboard and mouse seem like a slap in the face, I had to spend 30min-an hour just to make the game playable.",0
Negative,"Don't get me wrong, I have currenlty 60 hours in the game and most of it is fun. But it's been months after release and the PC port is still a buggy, crashing mess. Frame stutters all over the place and constant crashes, which forces you to restart your pc since the game takes over the screen and refuses to close. As fun as it can be, I don't recommend the game in it's current state.",0
Negative,"I bought this game as it has multiplayer and coop and while technically that's true its the worst kind. You can summon friends in temporarily in a limited capacity to help you fight a boss for a time. Unfortunately when you do another player who is extremely OP invades your game and decimates your group either before or during your boss battle. Summoning also takes a long time and is error prone. This is not fun and because of this we no longer summon others into our game. Its a good single player game, but that's not what I wanted. Why can't we have a party and go adventuring?",0
Negative,"220225: to improve performance do this:- Move the game to a SSD drive- Select High Performance power profile in windows Control Panel- Select High Performance in your GFX card control panel (Nvidia: Adjust image settings with preview and use the performance slider, apply, go to Manage 3D settings: Power management mode: High Performance, enable anisotropic sample optimization)- Disable GPU Scheduling in Graphic Settings (windows options)- if you know how to use MSI afterburner, raise power limit to the maximum (120% for me)-original angry review-There are ways to innovate on the game formula that gave you a devote fan base, forgetting everything you've learned and committing the same mistakes you did in the beginning it's not one of them.What a shame.Buy it when it's cheap, play it when it's properly patched/fixed.Details:- did you love the precise attack scheme of DS1? forget about it, did you love how fast and action paced is DS3/BB? did you love that? well it's your lucky day: now the game controls as a cheap ass mobile game while being janky af, you're gonna laugh at how the jump works.- do you love imprecise attacks? it's not fair that you get locked to a certain angle and miss the hit BUT now the enemies and bosses have the same ""feature"" making them miss their attacks even when they should land.- remember blight town? how about the whole game is slow (good luck making the game run on a 1660 without making it look like crap) tested on a R7 5700G + RTX 2060.seriously this is the last time I purchase a game before launch because all the reviewers praised it as the perfect game and the holy grail of the Dark Soul games; I was so excited to play this and so disappointed of the end result. can't refund this because I've been playing for 3 hours trying to enjoy the damn thing.",0
Negative,"Where do I start, its a mess of a game terribly put together especially for pc.Firstly, the dodge, back-step and print are all burnt to a single key, which is quite literally the worst way to set up the fighting, and the customisation for the keys is pathetic, it won't allow me to use half my keyboard to bind including CAPS, for some reason i can't bind caps to anything even though its really useful right about left shift, its not like i'm gonna be doing any typing while playing. Poor game design.Secondly, there's no world exploring is this game, you can never just explore and admire the devs creation, there's always something attacking you, it just makes the game annoying, Its like the devs failing at trying to make the game harder but don't know how so they just make it annoying.Third, there are multi boss fights where the boss will lock on to the player in an attack any no matter how much you dodge or roll to the left side of the boss the fucking thing will just pivot on the spot not even move its legs, to land a guaranteed attack. Along with it is the smaller knight fights as well, when he thrusts forward and I dodge to his left ending up attacking him from behind, he shouldn't be able to pivot his whole fucking body around to immediately face me and attack me. and finally on this is the RNG, its so BAD, ill go through a fight 7 TIMES and the enemy apparently just INVENTS a new move to just to waste my entire health bar. All this is just some DUMB shit I have had to deal with while playing this game. Poor fight design.FOURTH, aggro switching, the AI that runs the aggro on all of the bosses is the WORST I have EVER seen in a game, the boss can NEVER decide who it wants to attack. I literally have a video where Radagon smashes his hammer 3 times each FACING MY MIMIC, but LANDING ON ME> POOR FUCKING GAME DESIGN.Messer is the WORST for agro, I can have my mimic to an ancient dragon lighting attack that does 4000 damage but the waste of coding will CONTINUE to focus on me, giving me no time to rebuff or heal. POOR GAME DESIGN.FIFTH, Fusing moves. The game straight up has some bosses doing to completely different moves right after another, most of the time using two attacks into the same time frame, overlapping the attack making it impossible to dodge. Even powerful moves, no wind up, no build up, just straight into the next attack no matter have heavy or light the attack is. This of course sends the timing of everything in a boss fight off. Poor fight design.SIXTH, Unresponsive game play. Countless times I have pressed the button to get of my horse, heal, switch weapon, OPEN UP THE INVENTORY, and the game decides is doesn't want to do it. Bug mainly.SEVENTH, broken pairing. the game straight doesn't even block the shot or stun the enemy some times. Bug mainly.EIGHTH, Whoever the fuck decided it would be a good idea to not allow player to interact with the map while the game is in ""fight mode"", is literally a dumbass. I could be randomly exploring through the Luna Lakes and I go to open my map cuz I dont know where the fuck I am but I CAN'T, cuz the GAME decided that I should be fighting some random useless enemy that I rode past on my horse. MORE POOR GAME DESIGN.NINTH, Inconsistent starting moves, I entire into a boss fight and have no idea if the game is going to allow me to summon and vow or straight up start attacking me. This inconsistent bullshit is called POOR GAME DESIGN.TENTH, COPE MOVES, boy of oh does this game love cope moves. Doing to much damage to the boss? Dodged to many of his attacks? Well expect to be insta killed by either a whole health bar wiping attack that apparently hit you.the boss performing there most powerful attack up to 7 times or until your death. the boss stung locking you until you die or the boss performing their entire moves multiple times with no punishment windows until you die or run out of stamina. The worst bosses for this are, Magma Wyrm spamming the lava spewing walk attack 6 times IN A ROW, Melania performing water foul dance 4 times in a row.,Messer spamming hot trust attacks 12 times in a row, Godfrey(both forms) performing 7 stomp attacks in a row, Dancing Lion performing lightning attack 4 times in a row, Red Wolf of Radagon performing 5, 4 magic swords summons in a row, ETC.ELEVENTH, Poor boss AI, the game struggles like REALLY STRUGGLES to choose the correct attack. The devs did a TERRIBLE job coding in, distance reading, stamina reading, health reading, attack list reading and input reading into some of the bosses.Having a boss randomly jump back, run forward, spin around, swipe or change its attack mid air is not even fun, its straight up annoying, there's no satisfaction from killing a boss as it was all just RNG.TWELFTH, pretty simple, the attack option that comes from breaking an enemies stance or sneaking up behind straight up doesn't work sometimes. Bug mainly.THIRTEENTH, NPC being more powerful than bosses. Like having a random NPC that is more powerful than a boss is straight up stupid. (examples>Crucible Knight, Craian Knight(DLC), some dragons, Banished Knight, dogs(I Swear), etc). I never thought simply running pasts a bunch of NPCs would be so fucking annoying.Note: I have SEVERAL videos of everything stated above. And I have already posted some.Following, because of everything attacking you the game becomes repetitive and straight up boring making this game not worth my money at all. So game is blatantly unplayable on PC so you always have to use a controller. I ended up going into NG+1 to see if it was still, but nope it's the same poor game design. Additionally the fact that I have to go through an entire new game just for another ending on pc is straight up PATHETIC on the devs behalf, it makes the game so fucking boring having to face the same enemies all over again and even stronger just to get a different ending.Lastly, ended up in the DLC to see if the devs fixed anything but it turns out they didn't. turns out putting the same boss fight format into your DLC makes it really boring. Additionally, all the boss fights in the DLC are pretty easy excluding Mesmer and Radahn, having to hear the SAME LINES and the SAME starting animation and to die about 50 times to those two, for not even the same reasons. Its so REPETITIVE, its literally fucking BORING. I ACTUALLY got bored trying to fight those useless wastes of coding. If you it take more than 50 tries to beat a boss, it is no longer still, its RNG, (For example, 1 in 50 chance the Melania never does her water foul dance during the boos fight, ENTIRELY RNG).Originally the beautiful world, easy bosses, mid lore (wow everyone is related and incest), decent quests, fun weapons and good ending (Rannis one) sorta evened out the horrendous bullshit. bbbbuuuuuttttttttt now they added the DLC with more boring, repetitive bullshit and nothing else of value so it just a dumpster fire now.So game is blatantly unplayable, so I ended up uninstalling the game.",0
Negative,"Over 300 hours into the game(besides me being afk) I fought a man with a triangular hat and a sword named rivers of blood. He proceeded to emote gesturing for me to come towards him, then proceeding to hit me so hard with the ash of war that my controller vibrated and disconnected leading to my death. Overall, DO NOT recommend, this game is ass.",0
Negative,"After beating Elden Ring in roughly 85 hours (I tried to do as much side content as possible), I find my thoughts on it very scattered and conflicting. This makes deciding whether to recommend it or not very challenging because a recommendation is a very binary thing, either you should or should not spend your money on it. In the end, I m going to give it a thumbs down not because I dislike it or because I think it s a bad game but because it is a phenomenal game that is fundamentally flawed to the point where it will ruin enjoyment for all but the most committed Dark Souls fans. Apologies, this is going to be a bit of a ramble so if you d like to see if it s worth reading or you d like a TL;DR skip to the end.To start with the positives, the game is visually stunning, not to the level of the Demons Souls remake mind you, but stunning nonetheless. The vistas and overall world design present that of a land worth exploring. It is one of the few open world games I ve played that take advantage of the world it exists in. The combat is very well polished and is a straight improvement from the already streamlined Dark Souls 3 with the addition of jumping attacks and even more unique weapons and spells to play around with. Vitality as a stat has been removed and equip load and resistances have been baked into Endurance again which itself has been nerfed because stamina and stamina regen are much more forgiving in the game making it a less necessary investment than it was in the original Dark Souls. The first third of the game is much more welcoming to new players, more than any other Souls game I ve played and the reason for that is because of the open world design. Easy mode in Dark Souls has always been the leveling system. The more you explore, the more experience and skill levels you get to make later fights easier, and Elden Ring expands upon that with its open world. In a game like Dark Souls 3, if you can t get past Dancer of the Boreal Valley there s not much else you can do besides continue slamming your head into a wall until you win or give up. In Elden Ring, every main boss can be avoided temporarily so if you don t feel confident in taking them on at your current level you can go explore elsewhere and feel like you re making progress.However, and here is where I ll start to go into the negatives, this design philosophy is the seed from which many of my problems with the game evolve from. Because of the freedom to choose where to go, many things get very difficult to balance very quickly. It s hard to craft rewards and challenges the always meet the player at where they currently are in their leveling. Boss difficulty is an obvious example, but another even more impactful one is the rune economy (experience for leveling up), which is frankly, completely bananas. There s no telling if an enemy will give you 100, 1000, or 10000 runes. Whereas in other games where the more difficult the challenge, the greater the reward, in Elden Ring it feels completely random. This problem also exacerbates the variations in skill level people will be at in different parts of the game. So, if you play like me and want to explore every cove and mountain, which the game encourages you to do, you will be incredibly overleveled for the first two-thirds of the game and difficulty will be most sapped out of it. Pair this with the fact that while the world is huge and varied the enemies and most especially the bosses are not. Catacombs, caves, and mines are fun until you realize 90% of them have repeat bosses or basic enemies scaled up to boss level health and damage. Hope you like fighting the watchdogs because you will fight that boss around 30 times whether as bosses or just basic enemies. Hope you like fighting dragons too. First time you encounter one drop on top of you it is incredible and tense, once it happens to you 10 more times it stops being that way. These are not one offs. There are, I would reckon, around 10 bosses that are repeated more than 5 other times in the game and probably 50 other bosses more that are repeated at least once. You find out very quickly that most of the work on boss design went into the dozen or so core story bosses which, to be fair, are mostly great, Radahn and Malenia are phenomenal imo. There are some troll and gimmick bosses but every Souls game is allowed a couple. My main issue is just because of the size of the game, they feel obligated to overpopulate the land with bosses but without the time to properly flesh them out so they just end up being a reskin of another boss making it tedious. The sad thing is that it cheapens the really good boss fights and doesn t let you set your expectations about whether the fight is going to be a memorable duel to the death or another snoozefest against a basic enemy you ve fought 20 times before.Lastly, I would be remised if I did not mention the Mountaintops of the Giants and the end-game difficulty spike, which is plainly ridiculous. I have probably close to 1,000 hours overall in every Dark Souls game including Demon s Souls, Bloodborne, and Sekiro, and this is by far the craziest difficulty spike I ve experienced. It s like they combined Frigid Outskirts from Dark Souls 2 and Hunter s Nightmare from Bloodborne and turned it up to 11. You have to constantly be on your guard at all moments. Pretty much any medium sized basic enemy from this point forward in the game can 1 or 2 shot you. The AI summon system, which up until this point felt like the true Easy Mode basically becomes a necessity. Bosses will 1 shot you with 70 vigor (close to the max health you can get). Enemies from the early game reappear with 5 times as much health and damage, while you ve already reached your softcap in vigor and damage meaning there is no leveling around this problem now. It s certainly doable, even without summons which is what I limited myself to during the bosses but god help new players who don t have the experience or time to build in the reflexes.In the end, I guess I could sum up my opinion on Elden Ring by saying it is simultaneously the easiest and hardest Dark Souls game and also ultimately, the best and worst Dark Souls game. This is simply due to the fact that it is so large and unwieldy that it is bound to have a lot of hits and misses. There are times in the game where you will think this is the greatest game ever made and other times where the level and enemy design is so bad you question whether or not it was even play-tested before release. Many of the problems I have with it, the rune economy, varying boss difficulty, over/under leveling, AI summons, copy pasting bosses, all evolve from the premise of the game being open world. So, while I agree with the fans that the open world is well crafted and probably one of the best a major game studio has developed, there are clear fundamental problems that need to be addressed with the Open-world Dark Souls formula if they are to continue down this path and make a sequel. If you still would like to experience it, I think it ultimately is worthwhile but something I personally will not be repeating for quite some time.",0
Negative,"DARK SOULS IV is the fourth installment in the DARK SOULS franchise and is a reimagining of the series as a whole with a much more modern spin to it. modernity including an arbitrary incorporation of Easy Anti-Cheat (which doesn't even prevent cheating, let alone in-game exploits due to the rushed development), constant crashing, system requirements that outspec most computers outside of NASA HQ to achieve even a shaky 60 FPS (which was a standard maybe 5-10 years ago), and a litany of trite asset flipping to pad the playtime.while I initially appreciated its similarities with DARK SOULS II, my favorite in the franchise, such as its magic being a focal point and leaning far more into the high-fantasy style environments (especially with the enemies, which is cool until you're fighting the same retextured dragon for the 100th time), but eventually it wears on you as every area has the same palette and style of progression.the open world is really a detriment more than anything, especially when this was meant to ""fix"" the antiquated multiplayer in the previous titles. for example. not being able to use the horse while you are being invaded or doing co-op is a major downside, as much of the world is massive empty space which takes ages to traverse on horse (at least solo you have fast-travel), let alone by foot. there's also absolutely nothing worth finding in the open areas of the game. the actual treasures are found in its linear sections, where From Software has always strived, which makes me sad that they didn't go for a smaller, more linear world that was more fleshed out rather than attempting to make the world seem more grandiose than it is. it's empty and barren, and not as a stylistic choice like the series is known for.reused bosses were a major downside of DARK SOULS II and are part of the reason why many view it as the weakest Souls title. they didn't reappear in DARK SOULS III, but they do in this game due to its rushed development. and it's not even like it was in II (e.g. Smelter Demon Blue Smelter Demon with modified moveset), there are literally copy-and-pasted bosses with maybe two minions thrown in and it's treated like an entirely new experience.not to mention in II there are only a few examples of reused bosses in the base game (non-SotFS), whether it be from previous games or within the same game (I can list all of them right now: Ornstein, Belfry Gargoyles, The Pursuer, and Dragonrider(s). whereas in DARK SOULS IV: Return of the Ring, there is a actual table that is needed to list how many bosses are reused and which aren't (see here).the story is pretty good, actually. I like it. the issues I have with the game are primarily with its gameplay and design fundamentally, either due to rushed development or loss of focus.all in all, incredibly disappointing and did not hold my interest long enough to go for all achievements, unlike every other previous SoulsBorneKiro title. maybe over time it can redeem itself, like with the disastrous release of Cyberpunk 2077, but I think it's alienated From Software's original Souls fanbase too far to regain their interest in this title.",0

Negative,"I love FromSoft games, and I have for many years, but the PC ports are always neglected. This time though, Elden Ring has the FromSoftware standard 60 FPS cap with abysmal performance, stuttering in fights and frequently in the open world. Sometimes they can last a second or longer, becoming extremely frustrating. Walking around stuttering is frequent; my CPU is running at 4.5Ghz regularly on one core, and yet most of the other cores are sleeping. GPU usage is only 40% or so, and I've tried lowering settings but to no avail. This level of performance is infuriating and quite frankly makes the game unplayable. I will likely be refunding the game if this is not resolved soon. The icing on the cake is that it doesn't even support ultrawide monitors; FromSoftware is repeating the same mistakes they've made for the last decade. The inclusion of last minute anti-cheat (probably to fix the RCE exploit) means the game cannot be modded in the slightest, even offline, or you risk being banned. Great.",0

Negative,"The steam review system is exceptionally flawed with its simple up- or downvote system, yet I must decide upon it. First let me say that I generally adore FromSoftware's games, but Elden Ring left me quite disappointed.Open WorldA breakthrough compared to its previous games is principally its expansion to open world. But, what is the purpose of an open world game? Generally, I would argue it is its choice in exploration, open world engagement, randomized patterns, longer play time,. Are these kind of things a positive thing for the souls genre? The choice of exploration was already quite large in most DS games, especially in DS1/DS2. Does the current open world allow for more choice? In my honest opinion, no. The choice is quite artificial as the content is quite linear in difficulty scaling while there is an option to freely explore, the difficulty scaling by means of stats (generally noticeable by the tier of upgrade material being dropped/found) makes the free exploration of the content not feasible for a new player, whilst experienced players skipping content was a thing in DS1/DS2 regardless. It seems the main purpose of the open world aspect is to force exploration towards multiple mini-dungeons (separated into the caves, catacombs and mines) which generally offer collectibles and upgrade materials. Yet, the upgrade materials feel quite necessary as I personally initially followed the hinted progression icons of the bonfires which lead me to progress to the first castle and I ended up finding upgrade materials for 3+ to 6+ and 6+ while my weapon was still 2+ as I still hadn t found enough of the first material. Interestingly, I had enough to get my weapon to 7+ once I found enough of the tier 1 upgrade material. In that sense, the exploration and sense of choice seems artificial. I believe for this kind of approach an enemy and item scaling feature should have been implemented. I must say that the open world engagement and immersion is quite polished. The areas are generally crafted quite nicely and it looks nice, although it is clearly noticeable on your rig (open world areas were initially laggy while the castles weren t, I needed to lower quality merely for the open world areas which did not really interest me regardless). Yet, the open world feels empty most of the time, sometimes there are items, entrances, bonfires or secrets that you want to find which lead you to explore every nook but this effort generally feels wasteful. The act of finding every single item is especially tedious and wasteful in such a huge world (I must applaud FromSoft on the scale of the world while retaining the detail on the terrain however). I think the open world trend is based off the slow improvements of the capability of our systems, yet a bigger world is not always a plus in my opinion. The quality and experience is generally just dragged out, which leads to more downtime which is counted as playtime but is it really? Is running around for 2 minutes in a direction on your horse really playing the game or is it merely a fancy animated loading screen or QTE? Needless to say, I don t adore open world games (even if I think FromSoft did a real good job on it). I don t think the open world concept adds much to the strength of FromSoft s kind of games. The additional concepts of a more repetitive type of grindy dungeons, puzzles , horses combat and such are debatable and will be mentioned later on and are not necessarily exclusive to open world games. The open world aspect shone more brightly in the castle type areas, or more enclosed places. The first castle was especially very neat. It reminded me of the first area in DeS but expanded. It was linear at times, but often branched out in many ways with even options for parkour. It truly reminded me of an FromSoft souls game with more freedom, choices and exploration in a good way. But on a larger scale, especially in the open world, it just feels bland and tedious (and generally associated with being able to use a horse). This, however, does not mean I dislike the enclosed areas that one can travel to. The mini dungeons, even when they felt lackluster with repetitive bosses at times, felt like a nice change of pace by allowing people to advance the main quest or do mini catch up lower difficulty content. The issue I see is the requirement to do these dungeons for upgrade materials or equipment that may fit your preference of your character s combat style. The exploration just feels too mandatory, and it is too tedious to find key locations. A smaller world that clusters all this content would honestly be an improvement, in my opinion. I never found holding the forward key and occassionally pressing the roll key to sprint enjoyable gameplay after all, especially if it may have taken up half of my game time.A previous aforementioned issue with the open world is the scaling; as you don t know where you should go and you may go to too high level areas which you cannot even use the upgrade materials for, you may also end up at lower level areas after being overleveled due to having completed higher level content. This experience reminded me of why an easy mode in this type of game does not work. Once one has too many stats, one can just button mash their way to victory. It is the most boring and unenjoyable form of playing the game I can think of. FromSoft s games always had a very strong and enjoyable combat that shines because one needs to actually learn it if one can overcome the whole ordeal by just spamming the attack button and outdamaging the opponent, there is little joy to be found. This experience may be undergone without any type of difficulty scaling in an open world game. You do a high level area and explore a low level area and the whole content just feels wasted because no part of the content challenges you because you take no damage and basically one shot everything. This is obviously also possible if the world was smaller, but the fact that the world is so big makes it just so much more possible for it to occur. The directionless style of FromSoft s games works way better if it doesn t take as long to travel in any direction and find something.May I just shortly mention the added concept of puzzles with the open world concept, which is the puzzles towers which essentially is nothing more than playing hide and seek with an transparant enemy that can be on any surface nearby (without hinting the maximum distance). I already found the exploration tedious, but going over the nearby areas multiple times to check every nook and every ridge multiple times to find them all (in a specific order?). I believe puzzles can be great fun but I don t think hide and seek is classified as a puzzle. In my experience, puzzles require the person to figure something out , not to look around enough. The concept of not knowing what something means and/or finding out what to do with it, is something I d associate with the puzzle concept. One could argue that realising killing the transparant turtle three times in different locations is the puzzle, but then it should have been a one time thing; considering it is a multiple time occurrence with the only difference being the location of the hiding turtle, I would argue the location is it. which once again, I don t consider finding something by just looking everywhere is a puzzle. I mean. do we call illusionary walls puzzles or secrets?Part 2: https://pastebin.com/gWGeTxau",0
Negative,"Anyone who actually thinks this is peak FromSoftware is trolling. Interesting, unique monsters to the specific area? Stuff that! Let's put the same bloody dudes in every bloody location so you truly FEEL like an undead from the critically acclaimed DARK SOULS, going insane from the constant looping. This isn't even unique to the goons, it happens with bosses! I have fought the same love-child of Mr Fantastic and King Tut too many bloody times!Yeah we got the horse and the free-roaming, but after the initial serotonin injection into the blood stream you realise that this is just Skyrim but without the cool forests and a decade later. Enemy placement also means jack compared to any other FromSoft game, as it feels like a 6 year old has been experimenting with Kodu. Enemy here, enemy there, BUT DON'T YOU DARE USE THE HORSE TO RUN PAST ALL THE USELESS XPLESS F*CKERS OR THE FANBASE WILL MOCK YOU. And don't even TRY to use the summons or spirits, because why the hell would you use a game mechanic?Shrine Maiden is genuinely the worst one in the entire franchise. Does jack sh!t and isn't even attractive like Emma or Emerald Herald, only larps about her mummy issues. GUESS WHAT? I DON'T CARE.No locations piqued my interest after the initial starting area. We got Anor Londo rip-off but its even more stale than Code Vein's, the land of the giants coz I really wanted more Dark Souls 2, and an endless array of caves and catacombs that host the world's lousiest bosses. Elden Ring tries to gaslight you into thinking this is a genuine open world, but it isn't, coz insane level scaling of enemies prevents you from exploring at your own leisure. It is merely a bloated version of Dark Souls but without the sophistication or class.I did like the NPCs at the start and how they actually made this stale world feel alive, but once again they screw that up as all of them fade into obscurity harder than a Yu-Gi-Oh female lead. Also so many dumbass puzzles you get flamed for for not immediately opening a wiki page to consult the elder gods. No I don't want God of War levels of handholding, but at least don't imitate my Year 10 IT class' photoshop assignment by putting a turtle in a F*CKING TREE without any lead-up!Elden Ring just feels like they tried to cram absolutely every single thing they could into one game, but not for the better. A shorter, linear game like Sekiro proves you can do a simple storyline that excels and is made better by the iconic enemies and environments. I cannot for the life of me tell you the names of any character in this game besides the recurring G.O.A.T. Patches, and every main story boss looks and acts the same. Maybe don't hire the dude who wrote himself into a corner as your main writer!Either I am outgrowing video games or FromSoft genuinely peaked with Sekiro. I would rather watch my Nan attempt to play Garfield Kart than ever touch this horrendously overhyped pile of steamed sh!t. This might actually be the Arkham Knight of FromSoft. The only redeeming parts of Elden Ring are my initial few hours of the game and Patches.",0

Negative,"A strong neutral.While I can recommend this game to any Souls fan, I cannot guarantee the ride will be entirely pleasant.Weapons and armors Weapons and armors have never looked so diverse in a Souls game. Here we witness the natural evolution of Weapon Arts from Dark Souls 3 with the introduction of Ashes of War, which adds unprecedented diversity to the combat system.BuildsBuild diversity is off the charts. Sorceries, incantations, a mix of the two, bleed/frost/poison builds, pure STR/DEX builds, bow/crossbow/ballista builds, consumable builds and these are just the standard ones. Hybrid builds add even more variety to the rich mix. The possibilities are endless.Open worldThe Lands Between is an open world in a true sense, meaning that you can take on levels in any order you fancy: too bored to go through Stormveil and want to do Raya Lucaria first? Hell, skip them both and do Volcano Manor first because why not? This is also perfectly demonstrated by how you can access Altus Plateau. Few games allow such level of freedom nowadays.Main DungeonsLegacy dungeons, while enormous, can still be beaten very quickly if you know where to go. This helps in subsequent playthroughs where you might not want to go through an entire dungeon.BlockingGuard Counter makes blocking a viable choice since Bloodborne and DS 3. Not only that, Elden Ring has made the sword and board tactic a real thing. Some dungeons are actually too easy with pure STR builds while pure mages might otherwise struggle.All in all, I would say the first 10-20 hours of Elden Ring will definitely make it worth trying BUT Weapon UpgradesUpgrade materials and their corresponding Bell Bearings (which enable infinite stocks at the hub s merchant) are poorly placed in the world. It s all well and good once you know their locations, but that first time you play the game will make you scratch your head as you fruitlessly scour the Lands Between for the smithing stones to upgrade your weapon a few levels closer to 25.StoryThe story in Elden Ring combines the worst of both worlds, that is, Miyazaki s cryptic (read broken ) lore texts coupled with many GRRM s repetitive elements you probably read in A Song of Ice and Fire: twins, intertwining royal family trees, familial in-fighting, political strife, same-sounding names (Godfrey, Godwyn, Godrick, Godefroy, ) and so on. In case of Elden Ring, and Soulsborne games in general, history is a much more accurate term to refer to the game s plot than story , since every important event in The Lands Between has happened well before we begin our adventure. All we basically do is kill those who are still alive.NPCsElden Ring has some of the most forgettable cast of characters I have ever seen in a Souls game. Most of them just randomly change locations in some vague quest for something unfathomable. Many of them you help, most of them die, some even invade you at some point, but almost none of them made me care about their fate. Also, if you thought NPC quests in previous games were confusing, then you will definitely not like what you see here.FarmingFarming in Elden Ring is unsatisfactory. Most enemies don t drop as many runes as they should, regarding their size and difficulty. This is important because every Souls game has a couple of farming locations that are accessible during various stages of the game. Elden Ring doesn t have many decent farming locations, and the only real one is locked behind an absurd NPC quest that requires you to kill a demigod first and then run around lots of places before you can access the place. It is a couple of hours into the game, which is not much convenient if it is the only real farming location in an open world game.Performance issuesYou have probably heard more than enough about this elsewhere, so let s just say it stutters on most systems. On steam, it sometimes lags so hard that I have to exit the steam software and restart it (sometimes more than once) to make it work again. Recycled elementsCatacombs and mines are repetitive like you would not believe. Go through a couple and you have seen them all. The same also goes for their mobs and bosses. Reused boss fights are also a real thing here, and some of the most unique bosses you have ever seen in the game return later in another unsuspecting catacomb/mine like it is no big deal.BossesBosses now employ some Sekiro-level tracking skills designed to roll-catch even the most astute players which, combined with their endless combos, makes for some truly frustrating experiences, which is only worsened the deeper one gets to the game.NG +NG+ and beyond has never been good in a Souls game, with the exception of Dark Souls 2. Basically, after you finish a playthrough with a character, you might as well start a new one as there is nothing to see at a subsequent playthrough other than higher numbers. PvPI haven t tried PvP enough to comment on it. From what I have heard, it takes too long to invade and most PvP players employ broken insta-proc bleed/frost builds that end the fight within seconds. You might as well jump down a cliff and die, saving yourself the trouble.Horse combatHorse combat is jankier than Mount & Blade, especially against mounted foes, so much that you are really better off fighting on foot. Constant stutters in open world makes mounted combat even more of a headache, especially against Tree Sentinels. You get staggered on horse easily and it takes a loooong time to recover, which mostly leads to you receiving more attacks and getting dismounted in the process. It is also infuriating to pick off items (not ingredients) from the ground while on horse. Platforming on horse is another hassle; you are usually better off dismounting just to re-adjust yourself before mounting again lest you fall off a ledge while turning on horse. Spammy enemiesI hope you like spammy enemies with infinite stamina and hyper armor because that seems to be the apex of enemy design in this game. And then come the lovable NPC invaders that break every rule that should apply to humaoid players, from unlimited stamina to broken poise to endless mana.Parry systemParrying has once again taken a nosedive ever since its golden days in Dark Souls 1. Some bosses now require multiple parrying before you can riposte them. Enemies also randomly switch between combos mid-swing, making a successful parry even harder. You will see them raise their hand, ready to strike, see you start the parry, then switch to a faster combo mid swing just to ruin your parry.Boring late-gameThe game really drags on towards the end. After what appears to be the end of a well-paced journey at the culmination of Leyndell , you are suddenly directed to a boring snowy area followed by a crappy bossfight before being teleported to another visually-pleasing yet mechanically-fatigued legacy dungeon which culminates in a bossfight that displays some DBZ-levels of aerial acrobatics. And it keeps getting worse right until the end, with a gauntlet of bossfights that are more about spectacle than meaningful battles. The final boss in particular was the final nail on the coffin. By the time it was over, I let out an audible sigh, relieved that it was finally over. You should never stretch a game this long to elicit that kind of emotion from a longtime Souls fan.ConclusionAll in all, it was a mixed first experience, and the true meat of the game for me was trying different builds and seeing them grow into perfection. And in that sense, Elden Ring is worth a try. It is a long journey that begins with huge anticipation, but the abundant flaws and the sheer length of the journey might leave a lasting bitter taste in the mouth of the traveler long after they have reached the destination. I did not touch the game again for a whole year.Peace out.",0

Can you say female body and male body ? no it's not a crime sticking to your ""natural"" birth gender you sideshow freaks.Now i can finally move on to the game, let's start by adressing the trailer, From Software likes to use ""big boy"" words especially Shakespeare but with little meaning or context.Controls, they have barely improved them since the first dark souls games, Icons are still referring to controllers which make using a keyboard and mouse a nightmare rather than a enjoyable experience that it should be. Even though you have superior controls the game does not know how to utilize them properly and things such as this should really not exist on pc. I blame Valve as much as i blame From for allowing them to sell their flawed game on this platform. You need to learn adulthood and take some responsibility for your actions, you are after all the host of this platform, if you can't develop pc games don't try to sell them, it's that simple, let this be a warning for any multiplatform developer out there.They still don't support aspect ratios such as ultrawide 21:9 which is what i use myself. Cooperative is still a one sided joke, only one player progress, after all these games and you still can't do it, maybe we should hope for a one trick pony then.The artwork as always is superb and even though many complain about the map being empty and boring i find it as good as the rest of the franchise, there are plenty of secrets and hidden pathways to be found so far.Is Elden Ring a great game ? i think it is but for full price i expect nothing but a flawless game, these problems with aspect ratio and controls should have been fixed a long time ago.I found out that you can change the promts to pc in the settings even though the default is controllers, so that helps quite a bit.Until you deliver a flawless game it's an easy decision for me to not recommend it.

You also strafe in a circle around your lock. Lots of fun vs a boss with an AOE attackI am pretty sure this game was designed to be played with a game controller and PC controls were just tossed in with no thought.

Negative,"as of the writing of this review i have played this game for 9 hours, and theres a good reason for that, two wordsperformance issues.i should be able too run this game with no problems, especially on the lowest settings. yet the frame rate consistently doesnt go higher then about 50, especially this long after launch i think thats not acceptable.it looks like a great game and i am really sad that i cant play it, i hope they fix this soon but in the mean time be warned that its not great on pc right now",0
Negative,"Elden RIng! oh boy, where do I start even!?.I love this game, I really do. I spent over 100h in it and loved almost every second.I cant leave a positive review tho since I cant even play the official online version of the game, whenever I try just that I get about 30ish fps on med-low settings with intense frame drops and horrific screen tearing while using a 1070ti. To play I have to use Flawless Widescreen with the fixes and an fps unlock to run the game on buttery smooth 100fps, tweaked high settings, stutter/screen tearing free and on an ultrawide resolution.This is crazy, if you ask me. what they did. completely idiotic. How is that every game dev these days lets us play their game with over 60fps? why does literally any major release include ultrawide support? why is it that fromsoft just cant do any of that? I really really don't get them, never did never will.They want to equalize the multiplayer experience they say, so they set an fps cap and place overlay black bars on ultrawide resolutions even tho the game still loads everything behind them. Have they ever considered that not everybody can play Elden Ring on 60 fps? have they considered that someone is mby playing on a more responsive monitor/mkb/controller, mby that someone is actually using a 4:3 monitor and this isn't fair either? This in my opinion is half-assed and completely ignorant of literally everybody that can either run the game on more than 60/ anybody using anything but a 16:9 res which lets be honest is most of us one way or the other. I can for sure say that fromsoft lately feels like bethesda, not fixing the game, instead relying on the community to fix it for themselves while they also spit in our faces with EAC (easy anti cheat).I want to play ER with a homie? sure I just have to sacrifice every last bit of visual fidelity and responsiveness and then I can! What a joy REALLY! I goddamn love fromsoft's braindead logic in some cases and if you're still here reading this I suspect you're either experiencing the same frustrations or you're just curious why in the world would anybody flame fromsoft.I love the company, I love their content but I goddamn hate their attitude towards pc players. I hope they have seen and heard enough of our rambling about these issues and maybe they'll decide to actually listen to us, stop being all high and mighty and improve our experience. We all spent 60 on the game, why are we pc players expected to just endure all the issues? It really seems like they dont really appreciate us as much as the console users.Well yeah ill stop rambling aswell, I wish you good day tarnished.",0
Negative,"After 10 hours into the game, I can say that this game is an absolute masterpiece. the discovery is fantastic and really addictive, the zones are magnificient and impressive, they're mystic and haunting, they are the definition of dark fantasy that I was looking for, I am really passionate about this game now. the rest of the review are my initial thoughts of the game playing for the first hours, the problem is that they didn't adapt it well for the pc, I hope that they improve in the future because it gave me big headaches trying to finally find a playable configuration of my liking (sometimes I have to swap from keyboard to controller for certain situation for example) and I also hope that they will optimise the graphics. and THEN it will be a perfect game, they need to learn how to make a game on a computer. The controls sometimes feel slow and not responsive enough on the keyboard compared to the controller. the fact that I am forced to play on a controller to be more efficient for fighting bosses is the proof that they didn't work well enough on the computer version, I was expecting an improvement in this aspect as this is their 4th entry on the PC. The controls are my biggest disappointment.First hours of playing & initial thoughts :'FIrst of all I'm not the biggest fan of the Dark Souls franchise, just lately Dark Souls 1 remastered started to grow on me and I like it, but overall I think theses games are overrated and overhyped. And this game definitely is. 10/10 from the media is insanely wrong for this mess.The thing I have always hated the most about the dark souls games on PC are the controls, they're so horrible and not optimised for keyboard, and I really expected this game to finally improve on that and they did not, they just copied and paste the same horrible controls from the past games into this one without changing anything to adapt it for the keyboard (having a 1 button keybind for run/dodge/parry is so bad I have no words, to not be able to remap dodge and run separately is garbage) so I had to spend almost the whole night to get used to the bad keybinds and set everything so that it can be playable. It was really frustrating and unpleasant.Talking about something not enjoyable, let's talk about the graphic optimisation of this game. the stutter is horrible even if I have a good spec, I was worried about that from some of the reviews I read (just like a day before release. they could've talked about this problem instead of blindly giving it 10/10 right away!?!?!?!?) So I spent more hours trying to find good graphic option to finally make it playable.Then on top of it all, the coop & multiplayer was a lie, I really thought I could play and progress together with my friend, it was an exciting idea to me to coop with my friend in a open world souls like game. unfortunately you can only just come and help your friend but you cannot do progression with him, even that, it is so uselessly complicated trying to understand how to summon & join others etc only to end up finding out that you need to pay a 1000 everytime. like wow, I understand Fromsoftware is trying to be hardcore and edgy but at this point. this is just not fun.Talking about Fromsoftware, I expected them to work way harder on some other aspects of the game, they have been really lazy copying the same systems, they did not innovate anything at all it's a dark souls in an open world. I expected way more, the auto-centering camera is so annoying while using the mouse it's just plain awful. They copied and paste the same combat from the previous games I expected more polished abilities. adding real jump & sneak mechanics is not innovation. the horse combat seems cool but that's about it, otherwise the world feels empty & dead compared to most other open world games, this one looks more like a survival game then a real rpg.'",0
Negative,"A well-crafted game, made unplayable by unforgivable technical issues.Stutters and graphical glitches are the norm these days, so they can be overlooked, even if they are present. And they are, regardless of how powerful your system configuration.However, loss of 10+ hours of progress to the ""cloud"" cannot be overlooked. A game that takes up 45+ GB of hard drive space cannot spare a few dozen more MB to have more than 1 save slot per profile, instead blindly overwriting data with no prompt or warning to the user.If such issues are resolved, then the game would be worth it - but they were already supposed to have been resolved, and yet here we are.In short, a great game - if you are willing to put up with the risk that whenever you pick the game up from the previous day, an arbitrary amount of progress can very well have gone down the ""cloud"" drain.",0

Negative,The game is great but the frame rate is very bad including game freezes. Not only that but it took 9 hours of gameplay to realize that console would be the more comfortable platform to play on. Also with various request from me to steam they have refused to refund my game or give steam credit back but to transfer it to XBOX CONSOLE given the reasons. I understand the policy of two hours on game and not being able to refund but for some people it may take more than 2 hours for them to fully understand that they do not want or like the game. The game is not going to show all its bugs at the start and may take some time. Steam if you are seeing this i want my refund.

Negative,"I must be the only one who finds this game plain and boring. You just roll around fighting repetitive bosses which have virtually identical mechanics.

Negative,"If you're a player of the older games like dark souls 1/2/3, demon souls, etc, don't get this game. The developers tried to balance their game around spirit summons and multiplayer encounters. On top of that, the bosses have TOO many delayed attacks, its genuinely annoying when a boss has a 4 second wind up for an attack, just for the same attack to actually come out near instantly. The boss design in this game was made to annoy the player, not challenge them. Every boss in the game has at least 3 AoE attacks, some of which hitting the entire arena (fuck you Hoarah Loux). One of the best ways I've seen this game described is bosses that have Sekiro like movements, and an player with dark souls speed. Almost every boss in the late game devolves into rolling around waiting 20 seconds watching the boss attack, just to hit the boss once and run off.",0

Negative,The base game is alright. Builds I liked in previous from titles aren't as viable any longer so I platinum the game using meta builds that felt cheap. The dlc is a different story. Everything I hate about the base game is amplified in shadow. It's not that it's too hard it's that I couldn't care less about any of it. I left shadow at the final boss without that deep urge to defeat him. That has never happened in a from title for me since kings field. I rather play demon souls over this any day.,0

I press a button other than dodge, the enemy is still too fast.)This game reminds me of my BIPOLAR ex-girlfriend. Very pleasing and serene to look at, but when things go bad expect EXTREME INTENSITY, AND EXTREME STRESS! Fun to ride but never tell your close friends and fam.When things get impossible, which happens often, you will have to go online for some help. like cheating to find answers. When anything is too hard, people will cheat and so will you. You can say I'm not really cheating. but you really are. After you beat a hard boss. 95 percent of the time the rewards are worthless.Shoot from far away! That's it! If you can't. good luck! 2 Hits or less from far away should kill your enemies. Otherwise. waste time and level up. WASTE TIME!This game was more stable before the DLC! I have an expensive PC system that can play anything.Don't BUY, NOT WORTH YOUR TIME! All enemies are too hard, Just make sure you have a defense that goes past 60 on strikes an you are decent. All bosses are full of SHIT! They hit too hard and too fast. There is NO STRATEGY! JUST HAVE GOOD DEFENSE AND KNOW WHEN TO DODGE! SO STUPID! NO STRATEGY!(UPDATE 7-17-24: I have to start Elden Ring several times because it stops launching game. I get lucky when it loads. I get to play.)My game keeps quitting after load screen if I go to a waypoint. So If I extract from a difficult area to go to a waypoint. it will quit. Then when I reload. I start where the hard enemies are where I tried to leave. This game SUCKS! It's too hard and now it quits and I respawn where it's hard. I LOSE RUNES! EFFORT! I WANT MY MONEY BACK!

NVIDIA OR WHOEVER NEEDS TO FIX THE DRIVERS, AS WELL AS THE BALANCING IN THIS GAME!(UPDATE 8/12/24 - Tried a bunch of weapons and ashes of wars and fought some bosses with the updates, and still went back to the same weapons I always use to defeat bosses. I wasted time again, nothing really new to use. There's a lot of variety but they only work on the weakest enemies. Please don't buy, not worth the frustration.)(UPDATE 9/26/24 - Tried a few weapons. I'm not going back to the same weapons just to finish the game, I'm just deleting this game so I can have more HD space for more FUN. because this is no longer fun.)",0

Negative,"Love the game, the world, the combat, etc. But something about the latest patch is fundamentally breaking the game - it's unusable (laggy and non-responsive) on even the MENU screen with essentially *nothing* else running on the PC (plenty of CPU / GPU processing and free memory to use to smooth things out, it just doesn't.)And Fromsoft is apparently blaming this on 3rd party interface device software, when it was working fine before the patch? (Don't even think I have any of that running.) Mistakes and bugs happen, would love to be in a world where they didn't, but that's nothing more than fantasy. but what matters is what happens afterwards. when you break stuff, own up to it and fix it, don't blame other people.",0

Negative,positive review once the final boss no longer drops your game to 20fps :3,0
Negative,"The Bad:- Glitch that makes me fall thru the map and lose all my runes.- Enemy hit boxes being bigger than shown.- Bosses have too much fast hitting attacks and mobility for how heavy they look which is just dumb IMO.- (Most of the game is locked behind the first boss, so if you don't have the skill to take him down good luck continuing the game.) I was wrong with this, look comment- 60 fps only. do i need to say more? for how big the game is, there should be WAY more options for high spec PC's.- Enemies get Immunity after back stab attacks, so you can't combo them. but you get no immunity and can be stun locked by multiple hits.- Enemies that look heavy are most likely the fastest Enemies in the game with quick attacks and mobility.- weapons are mostly the same, just look a bit different.The Good:- game looks good.- lots of weapons.- cool boss and enemy design.overall had no fun playing the game as the low fps game me frame drops, fell thru the map multiple times, losing 10k + runes because of that",0

Negative,"This really just feels like one of those games that people like because its popular to like. No matter how much I've tried to like the game, I simply cant find myself enjoying any moment of it. There's never a feeling of accomplishment when I finally beat a boss. I just walk out of the fight annoyed with the fact that I even spent money purchasing the game. The whole game is full of arbitrary difficulty. Where the game itself is not necessarily hard, but the way the game is designed make it difficult. The single biggest issue I have is with the camera. Every time a boss either jumps, or gets too close, the camera goes so far up my ass that I can't even see anything that's in front of me. This is a great game, only if you enjoy spending multiple hours on one boss fight just so you can go and do it all over again",0

Negative,"Unga bunga me hates reused movesets and bosses. Me hates big scary people/things whose hair won't budge an inch when me hits them with a 150kg bonking club. Me hates riding 500 miles only to get another golden seed or scadutree fragment.Seriously though, those are all my issues with ER and SotE. So if you don't care riding across Brazil to fight another Rotten Tree Avatar to be rewarded with another teardrop for your already too bloaty collection of Elixir components, go ahead and try out this once-in-a-century sensation of a video game.I had some minor complaints too before SotE came out. My first complaint at the main game is with the OST. Hot shittake of mine: ER OST by itself is NOT AS IMPRESSIVE AS ITS PREDECESSORS. Sure there are some pieces that made my eyes glint up when entering a boss arena. Namely Song of Despair, Regal Ancestor Spirit, Godfrey.But that's all that left an impression on my memory of my playthroughs, until the DLC came out. Tracks for optional bosses likeBayle and Midraredeemed a lot to the game's music.Personally, I attribute part of this issue to the addition of BGM in normal surroundings in ER, i. e. BGM out of boss arenas. In my opinion, the lack of music otherwise from boss fights has become a trademark for FS games since it added much significance to the experience of each boss fight, which usually takes place at the end of a long sequence of a certain area, i. e. after a certain period of traveling and fighting in the ABSENCE of music.My other issue with the main game is with its optional contents, mainly the questlines of NPCs. Apart from those few huge ""side"" quests which are related to their own independent endings, the rest of the NPC's stories are.just meh.Alexander is a bro, but there's no more than that. You fight together, then fight together again and fight each other. Fin. Thops' personal story's touching and inspiring, but his quest is literally a two-step fetch quest. And, I feel bad for saying this, but Diallos' quest is a dollarbook Bildungsroman minus the actual spiritual growth part, as the majority of his change and struggles are intentionally left unwritten, FS style.Yet, like the music, NPC sidequests in SotE are a lot more fun and engaging. Some are even counted among my favorite NPCs in FS games.Ansbach my bro, Igon my idol and Thiollier my beloved boy, broken, lost yet still fighting.This is what the main game of ER lacks and what didn't ring right with me I didn't have an experience of sharing a war cry with an NPC summon when we rush into the fray, or being inspired by a comrade-in-arms' post/pre-battle speech, or being struck by genuine grief when a companion meets their end. Yeah there's plenty of NPC summons in ER but as I recall all of them are mute throughout the fight, unlike Igon's blood-chilling ""CURSE YOU BAAAAYYYYLE"".However, don't mistake my compliments to the DLC as my final judgement at it. I hate it. Apart from those two improvements, SotE is, like another reviewer aptly put, an amplification of all the major issues of the main game. Big empty maps. Bigger, unmovable, unstaggerable enemies. And more reused ideas and asset. Finally,I FUCKING HATE RADAHN AS HE WAS IN THE MAIN GAME WHY MUST I FIGHT HIM AGAIN. No disrespect to the character, I just think dual-wielding is a dumb idea in reality and in fictions loathe any HUGE bosses, humanoid or not.All in all, Elden Ring is a well-made RPG with many of its charms. But to me, this is an ambition too large to be executed at an all-round level equal to the previous titles of FS.",0

The Fights dont seem to have a good flow, its just more of the "" i learn the pattern"", more than ever. The Bosses look nice, but the moveset seem to forget, that the player has a Camera, and giving me sea-sickness. If you just want to have the Same game as the Base-game, maybe a bit worse.

Negative,This gonna be here until they fix FPS in new location and change the balance of the bosses in DLCBalance of the DLC is complete . All bosses are just way to overpowered (kill u with 1-2 attacks) also have insane amount of HP and balance so u cant stun them with heavy weapons. Gamedesign of the main bosses and some npcs completly ruins the expirience of the dlc. Im really hope that from software hear the feedback and nerf bosses because right now it just so hard that becomes boring.

Negative,"I see the appeal, but am surprised by how popular a game like this is overall. I never found the game interesting or exciting. It was always a slog.First the elephant in the room, ""Well it can't be that bad, you've got north of 100 hours"". At least half of that was in a second play through with a friend using the seamless co-op mod. THAT is a fucking BLAST, and I'd play it for 100 hours more. Scroll to the bottom for thoughts on that.Exploring the world and progressing.While the game's approach to no quest log or markers is not for me, honestly, I will applaud the game here. Reading a wiki on my phone vs opening a map in game and walking to a marker isn't fundamentally different. For people who DO find this fun, good for them, and I'm happy to see a game cater to that.Personally, spent as much time on wiki's / reddit as I did in game because I just couldn't figure it out where to go or what to do once I was there. New dungeons take a long time to explore. Unless you have 2+ free hours to play, don't bother. You won't be able to make it anywhere. I didn't find it immersive to roam around aimlessly for play session after play session. There's next to no plot, and the lore is nonsense.The controls are purposefully bad. Swapping weapons, activating abilities, and using consumables requires scrolling through them one by one. Almost all moves have excessive input buffering, so double tapping a button or mis-pressing a button can easily force your character into a long, uninterruptible, actions.The RPG and character building aspects were my favorite part. There is *ton* of depth in how to build out a character. Additionally the game does a good job of presenting different challenges that require exploration and adaptation from the player. Unfortunately, all of the systems needed to build a character are hidden (respecs, access to enough upgrade materials). This makes the game twice as hard and unforgiving when you encounter an obstacle and *nothing* in your current arsenal will help. So in practice, until you're deep into the game and really understand the nuances of character customization, the RPG elements are yet another piece that punishes, frustrates, and turns the game into a slog.Seamless Co-Op is a totally different game, and very fun. The build limitations in the early through mid game lessen with a second person who can fill ability gaps. Exploration is much faster, more sets of eyes to spot places to try to get to, and more attempts before having to respawn. Places where the game is punishing, slipping up in combat, jumping to your death, can be funny from the other player's perspective. Finally, the moments of the game that have the big exciting payouts (killing a tough boss or figuring out a tricky puzzle) are even more exciting with friends to celebrate with you.",0
Negative,can confidently say the game was not fun for about 2/3 of the time I played it.,0
Negative,"I fucking hate this game with all of my fucking soul, while I have played it for 115 hours, it was because I really wanted to give this game a chance to be good, again and again and again and for fucking nothing. This game has hard bosses with combos that make me fall asleep until I actually have a chance to get a hit in, bosses that are hard and inconsistent, not from a no hit point, but from a casual playthrough point where one attempt you might have had good rng and did well and other times you just get fucked, and yes I AM LOOKING AT YOU GODSKIN DUO PIECE OF SHIT. I tried. believe me I tried to give this game a chance too see if it really lives up to how many people praise it to be. but it fucking sucks",0

Negative,"This is a masochist's game, I can't understand the hype about this game, it's definitely good, but it's not fun. Exploring is a terrible experience with around 136 individuals chasing you, making exploration boring, the quests are mediocre, the secondary permissions are easily forgotten. And lastly some boss fights, I feel like I'm constantly committing self-h*rm. It's very expensive and it would be difficult to recommend this game to anyone.",0
Negative,"This game is garbage from all points of view, on the pc version it runs incredibly bad even after a year after its release. The game is still full of bugs and on the story side it doesn't even compare to its older brothers Ds3 / Bloodborn etc.Additional after finished the Game :Rubbish game, I felt compelled to finish it felt like I worked full time on it, very poorly optimized considering I have a RTX 3060, very repetitive gameplay and a map to explore that feels like you need time off from work to explore it. I am deeply disappointed with absolutely everything this game stands for, I had very high expectations from Fromsoftware but unfortunately this game will die in my list of games never having been played",0
Negative,"**** PC port with the quality of an amateur PS2 port. False advertisement as it does not run playable on the recommended system requirements. Several people report glitched fps that runs even lower than expected and it did not get fixed. No DLSS or FSR and you can clearly see it s a console game lazily thrown on Steam, zero respect for the community. Great game when it runs, ****** company. Refunded.",0
Negative,"Next time try to make a good save system, that, you know, doesn't overwrite both main and backup saves at the same time, not really fun to lose an ng+ character with 100+ hours played. Also poor balance, and delayed attack fiesta isn't good when it comes to boss design.",0
Negative,"Buggy, will crash on you alot",0
Negative,"Played this all the way through and found pretty much everything the game has to offer so I'm fully convinced.This game is just Dark Souls 3 with worse everything and even more rollspam.They keep nerfing parries. Some bosses take 3 parries to get a stance break for a riposte that does less damage than a jumping r2, so the only real playstyle in this game is to roll 100 times and r1 or jump attack until the boss dies.The core gameplay is souls and I like that, and it is unfortunately the latest game with the most players so I still play it sometimes but it's really just not that enjoyable. Summons are supposed to be a gimmick to make beating bosses easier. What's the penalty for this obvious advantage? Nothing! There is no reason to not summon a clone of yourself and just steamroll every boss in the game. This obviously makes the game completely mindless and boring. You're either taking unavoidable damage and dying because you want the old school souls experience or you're just blankly staring into your monitor while stun-locking idiotically designed bosses. This means that if you criticise the game for being too hard, people will just whine about you not summoning and being an elitist for not cheesing every boss into oblivion, and if you point out that summoning makes the game too easy, people will just whine about you being a ""contrarian"" because you're using super OP items and summons. Even though using summons and OP weapons are completely valid according to these same people. So unless you want to constantly micro-manage the game's difficulty to ensure some correct level of challenge (never happened in any other souls game) this game isn't for you.The most obnoxiously designed bosses in any Fromsoft game. All bosses in this game do these physics defying flips and hover in the air to try and deliberately roll-catch the player. Something I used to like about the other souls games is that the player was just a part of the world. Nobody specifically hated or cared about you. It just felt like exploring and finding cool stuff. Elden Ring feels like the one singular goal of the entire game world is to piss the player off. Enemies are designed with artificial roll catches and high damage numbers to make intuiting boss attack patterns impossible. Every enemy will go to attack and then hold in midair for no reason before magically exploding the air in front of them for half of your health bar. All anyone seems to talk about is how ""cool"" the fictional bosses are. It's like the entire appeal of the souls games has been reduced to ""Watch my new OC completely demolish your player character, isn't he so cool? This is so much better than the old games right?"" It's like one of those powerscaling guys that think infinity + 1 is bigger than infinity made a souls game. Also on a separate note. This is like the third time Fromsoft has made Demon's Souls with renamed items. Miracles, Sorceries and pyromancies, weapon arts, estus flasks, invaders, summons and all the main weapon types all return from the last billion games From have let awkwardly slide out of the sludge pipes in Elden Ring. The story is all pretty much the same again. e.g. Age of dragons before the age of man (guess what their scales are made of and what they're weak to, you'll never guess), giant ass trees everywhere, crucible is basically chaos from dark souls, nobody can die because of undead curse (tarnished), corrupt church trope that has been used in every other game, the world is a cycle again with the whole age of whatever endings, every enemy is out of their ""prime"" basically powerscaling logic to make them seem even cooler to 10 year olds, every notable event has already happened and the player is just a bottom feeder, Cult of dragon worshipping people that turn into dragons suggesting humanity and dragons are linked somehow, black flames are back and they don't even have a reason for being other than it looks cool (not tied into humanity like in Dark Souls) and not to forget that the player is resurrected from death to save the world from something again and the player decides to go and kill everybody of any renown by any means necessary for no reason other than being told so by random nobody NPCs. Brilliant.My playtime is almost 400hrs. 400hrs? You ask. How could someone possibly despise a game this much and also have 2 and a half WEEKS of real world time invested? Surely I secretly enjoy Elden Ring and just made a negative review to hate on the game because I'm a contrarian right? Nope. The next thing I want to talk about is just how much this game wastes your time. Firstly that time is not as impressive as it seems. That's 400hrs spread across 2 and a half YEARS and not to mention a significant portion of that time was spent in the DLC which is much better than the base game. And secondly; I have played this game through 4 times. Once by myself and with no summons. The next one I basically blitzed through with mimic and the last two were with friends or unique builds. Each playthrough was probably 80 hours long aside from the first which was more like 160. because I actually explored and completed the side content. If you are a completionist like me. DON'T play this game. It is a nightmare of copy pasted bosses and spambush enemies with sweeping unpredictable billion hit combos and useless crafting materials for days. Not worth it. I play this game sometimes because it's basically Dark Souls 3.5 and has the most Player interaction now because it's the mainstream one. Dark Souls 3 is a fun game with its combat mechanics, so this game is a fun game with its combat mechanics. But if you didn't enjoy Dark Souls. This game ain't it.Not to mention even the ""Ashes of War"" (basically weapon arts with a different name again.) don't even work on bosses because 90% of them just ignore the attack and smack you out of the air halfway through.Basically this game is super unbalanced and its community is full of idiots who cannot stand the idea that games being fun is better than games being an AI dick-measuring contest.",0

Negative,"i mean its alright, like, overrated af in my opinion",0
Negative,"It is actually a pretty fun game, the reasons I don't recommend and pros and cons are as followsPros:-Crafting system which enables you to fight things off, you wouldn't be able to normally with your loadout.-Overhauled and unique Spell system.-Open world which rewards exploring.-Engaging and fun to fight enemies. Cons:-The enemies and Bosses have way too fast movesets and they just throw attacks at you the entire time, which leads to the player having to fight like an idiot.-The weapon movesets your character have are really amateur and ridiculous, for example, in Dark souls 3, you swung an axe coordinated and smart but in Elden ring you just go ""axe go swing"", the character basically treats it like a mace, which it isn't! it's an axe with which you cut not smash.-The weapon combo basically punishes you more than rewarding, in the previous From software games, you could attack for as long as your stamina allows you to but now, everytime you do a full combo, your character just shortly does nothing for no reason.-Your stamina regenerates way too fast, which was kinda the whole thing in souls games, no matter how strong you were, if you have no stamina you couldn't win or atleast be weaker, due to that the player does not appreciate stamina and all the stamina improvement items are completly useless or atleast change nearly nothing.-You can't kick anymore! It is now a damn ash of war, like WHY?! PVP is so boring solely for that reason, you can just fight with shield and spear and the enemy can do nothing if he doesn't have the kick ash of war. because of the previous reason, you can just become a turtle, block and thrust the entire time and if your stamina is nearly gone, just unblock for like 2 seconds and it has regenerated again, I do not understand why they changed it.Due to Fromsoftware trying to go away from Dark Souls and them saying that Elden ring has nothing to do with the previous games they have published made them do terrible mistake with Elden ring's design, which is very tragic since the last dark souls, which is dark souls 3, had some of the best combat I've ever seen and fighting enemies was fun and punished the correct things. I know I have way more cons than pros but that is for a reason also I am currently playing through Dark souls 3 and have 841 hours in elden ring at the current moment, so keep that in mind before hating.Bonus: there are some great mods I recommend which are, Seamless Co-op: it let's you play through the whole game with max. 8 players and it is really well madeConvergence: Convergence adds alot of variety and great weapons, spells and even classes, Convergence also builds on the atmosphere which Fromsoftware failed to do themselves, it is huge and still in active development, so give it a try.",0

Negative,"This shit was so bad it retroactively poisoned the other Souls games by proxy to me. I don't know what delusion everyone's been under to act like it's God's gift to gaming the past 2 years but I'm so sick of it. It's a frustrating, obtuse, boring mess of a game that at it's best moments only reminds you of a time when this developer made their only two good RPGs with Demon's Souls and Dark Souls 1. This shit ain't even a review so much as a way to vent, but I HATE this game so I gotta get it out there.Lyndell is the only good area, and of course it gets buried by the end so you can't return there in post game, everywhere else is either an empty field, a copy paste of the same handful of dungeon layouts, or just bad like the final area. Anyone who says it changed open world design has their head up their ass, it's literally no better than games from the mid to late 2000s in the 7th gen with stuff like Oblivion or Assassin's Creed 2 in terms of how the world is laid out or what populates it. The only difference is there's no quest markers, which big deal old games from the 90s and early 2000s didn't have them either, and the open world is almost exclusively populated by enemies, which greatly limits what you can run into. The world itself is also just confusing to navigate and nobody does a good job at hinting at where you should go, such as everyone directing you to Stromveil right away rather than the Weeping Peninsula which is generally considered the starting zone you should play. I didn't even know it existed until after beating Stormveil, and difficulty isn't a good way to show people where not to go because these games are inherently designed to be hard, so you may just think you're not skilled enough as a player to advance and try to use other tactics to no avail when you just need to come back later. It's unclear in a way Dark Souls never was, which really describes the open world to a T.The combat is just better Dark Souls III with a jump, which controls fine enough it feels good to move around and fight, but the bosses are legitimately infuriating. They all read inputs, they're all faster than you are, they all hit like a freight train, and they're all packing on the health bars. Later fights even start spamming projectiles at the same time like DSIII because it's the only thing left to make the fights harder while still keeping within the same combat design. I get puzzle bosses were never a strong suit of these games but at least ehy gave some variety. Variety is certainly something that could have been used here too as like 80% of the bosses you fight will reappear multiple times and randomly have their stats adjusted, some are way weaker, others way stronger, sometimes within the same area. It gets old quick.Story is non-existent outside item descriptions I can't be asked to read anymore. That's been the case since Dark Souls 1 to a degree, but before there were at least some clues and a clear goal to keep you somewhat invested. Here I beat the game and genuinely couldn't tell you what happens beyond I burned a tree down and sat on a throne. Truly this is Dark Souls II-2.The soundtrack is once again forgettable outside the main theme. Said theme is fine, I don't care much for it but it's not bad either, but it's the only song I remember and hearing the absurd praise the score gets is genuinely baffling. Demon's Souls had good music, Dark Souls 1 did too, but over time the OSTs have gotten more and more generic and forgettable to the point we're down to a single song. What's even more confusing is when you take into account From's early games like King's Field, which all have great soundtracks, with KF IV The Ancient City being a great example of creating a rich dark atmosphere while still having more melodic tunes going in the background (give City Ruins, Holy Forest, or the Shop themes a listen to see what I mean). Given the world now has music playing over it again, unlike Demon's and Dark Souls, you'd think the soundtrack would get more emphasized and have more memorable songs playing through the game but again I legitimately couldn't remember one.To make a long story short. This game sucks. I hate it, I hate that I seem to be the only one who hates it, and I hate how it's become some kind of poster child for what good games are despite not being one at all. Can't wait t see it somehow win GOTY a second time in a year it didn't even release in while better games get jack shit.I enjoyed Dark Souls 1, had fun with Demon's Souls, DSII was a bit of a mess but it had its moments, DSIII was a soulless frustrating time but at least it was short, but this one was the last straw. It was a frustrating, bland, disappointing waste of time.",0
Negative,"Bloodborne paced game with Dark Souls 2 movement and animations. My favorite part about this game is how the AI is programmed to immediately do their ranged attack when you press the heal button. If the developers have to design a boss that just spams you with range attacks just so you can't heal, it would explain why the ending of the game is so lackluster as the final boss is. Or the 12 hit combo moves that most bosses pull just so they can do it all again. There's also so much visual clutter at some fights that you can't even react to the bosses attack since you don't see shit and have to pray you roll at the right time. Everything staggers you in the game even from the most basic of enemies, you can't move for a moment at all, that goes onto ash of war animations, you're forced to watch your guy strike a pose everytime you use your ash of war, whats the point of it when you always get hit by 12 hit combo maneuvers from bosses that barely have any telegraphing. The open world is lackluster, you always end up just exploring copy pasted dungeons with the same enemy types. The only thing that sets this game out from the rest of FS games is the visuals and the art direction. This game plays like Dark souls 2 but the enemies move like anime characters, have fun with that. You're forced to change your playstyle for most difficult bosses since this game is made around the bosses to have the most bullshit spam attacks just so they can say they made the game ""harder"". Beating doesn't feel good as in other soulslike game, you're forced to play in the most cheesy way in order to actually best the boss, get good doesn't apply here, beating the game just doesn't feel good as in other games where you actually have to get better as opposes to this game where its all about learning attack patterns like im playing fucking geometry dash. And what is up with this trash button queue, why is the game taking priority of my attacks, especially with the pace of a game like this where everything moves fast besides you. Let's say i press attack twice, but i see an attack coming in before my second attack even starts, i press dodge while my first attack finishes, the game attacks again. If thats how it works fine, but guess what, you can't cancel animations or cancel attacks, so you get hit with the full combo then, get stagger and possibly are dead. What the fck is wrong with this design choice? Then add all the bullshit AOE attacks most bosses that do way too much damage for no reason. This game is the most annoying piece of work FS has ever put out.",0

Negative,"I want ds1, ds2 and ds3 servers back. I bought the deluxe version preorder and beat the game within 2 weeks of it being out, but being left unsatisfied and disappointed. and The pvp in this game is horrendous and some of the boss fights are down right unfair. Did a horrible job with the duo boss battles, where in the other games like ds1 orenstein and smough was actually balanced. It gives too much freedom to the player, for example if you have a certain combinations of items like the infinite fp flask and the comet azur spell with a high int build, makes the game way too easy. This does make the game more appealing to new players but for me personally I really didn't have fun with the game and how the previous games had a great feeling of trying over and over again to defeat a boss and succeeding by using your past memories about the boss. But at the same time I know how other people have fun, because everyone has fun in their own way. That's all I really wanted to say about the game.",0

Negative,"Honestly, it is a fun game but, I don't think it is anywhere near as good as people say it is. While I can appreciate the difficulty, and the mechanics one of my biggest issues is that a large majority of the game feels as if its just copy+paste. There are over a handful bosses that are actually unique, but there's another majority that don't feel unique at all. Same with the environment, sure there are a lot areas but those areas make up huge areas of the map. Dungeons are again all copy pasta from one to the next. I feel like I got my time out of it about half-way through the overall game, but the puzzle like lore just was dumb in my opinion. But overall, I think I would say its worth it at half-price. I regret spending the money on release, but wanted to go through as all my other friends played and didn't want to miss the hype; overall, not worth.

Negative,"It comes down to a simple question. Are you someone who wants to enjoy a game, or are you an obsessive who can't rest until you manage to finish something you're failing at? The game legitimately isn't enjoyable. It is solely for people who have an inability to sit the game down unless they ""defeat"" it. That's me. I'm genuinely not enjoying my time, I just can't stop myself from banging my head against the wall until I break through. When I beat the various bosses, there's no joy, no satisfaction, no feeling of victory. Just a weary sigh of ""great, that one's over with."" This isn't a joke review about ""git gud."" You don't have to ""git gud."" You can beat this game solely by grinding at it for hours and hours, you'll eventually win. It's inevitable. The way it's made, either you'll get so used to patterns or you'll level up enough to rip through. But it's not satisfying. And it's a shame because the world of the game is so expansive and pretty you'll really, really want to see it all. But the bosses gatekeep every area and they are not even remotely fun.

Bosses attack in seemingly ad-hoc attack patterns that are difficult to read, additionally, the long windup animation and actual attack delay destroy the Dark Souls 'dance' of dodging a boss attack, countering with your attack, then repeating.If bosses were designed to be fair yet challenging, like in earlier souls games, this game would be a perfect 10/10, however, and I believe many will agree with me here, the boss design for many bosses make the game frustrating to progress through.",0
Negative,Fps still locked to 60.Still no FOV slider.Still no PS button glyphs.Combat is boring af.I just can't bring myself to continue this game.,0
Negative,"I just installed an armor mod and Steam was offline but somehow the game banned me for 180 days, not good for modding ,not gonna buy anything from this company anymore",0
Negative,Screw invasions. I love DS and co but I'm just here for the co-op. God forbid we have an option,0
Negative,game is not for everyone so it shouldn't be made imo(also no 18+ secs so -10/10),0
Negative,"There is an intended delay input that ruins your roll timing. Can't enjoy this game because of it. Go back and play Dark Souls 3 and Sekiro and see if you feel as much delay as Elden Ring have. FromSoftware wants to the make the game artificially hard but does this instead of making well designed difficult bosses like Slave Knight Gael. And no there is no controller delay input or pressed but not let go because there is no controller at all. Ive been playing with keyboard only from Dark Souls 1, quick tap space every time to roll. And my PC specs are RTX 3060 TI, Ryzen 5 3600 and 16 GB RAM. So my PC isn't giving me delay, neither are my keyboard. I am done with this game because of it, I refuse to play a scared ranged magic build running around and gunning every boss down like the rest of these players. I want to run in there with no shield but a sword and roll dodge everything, and while i've learned the patterns, i simply can't react in time because the delay input is too long. Why do you have the boss attack so bloody fast when you implement a roll input delay? It just doesn't make any sense. Fix this and ill overlook the terrible open world, terrible difficulty balance, the endless repetition of the bosses, the overkill moveset the bosses throw at you, the lame NPCs storyline, the non-existent maiden, the lame story, and the fact that it is not even close to how amazing Dark Souls 3 boss designs were. I mean at this point I rather fight Gael than all of the bosses combined in Elden Ring.",0
Negative,"I want to love this game but it has some very glaring issues that make me unable to recommend it. The boss design is terrible, some of the worst in any game I've played ranging from bosses that do extremely long, almost impossible to avoid combos that end in delayed AoEs so melee players can't get in, or the boss will fly completely across a huge map constantly so you're chasing and dodging for an eternity hoping to get 1 hit in or the boss is made that you can only attack if you take damage but all the bosses hit like a nuke, even with full vigor most bosses can take half your health in 1 hit, but ranged players aren't home free either, there are bosses that are completely resistant to magic, story bosses that are immune or heal from things like holy damage so if you tried to make a faith build around holy damaging weapons or spells, your journey ends here because that story boss is completely immune to you and the fight would be hard already for a build that can actually damage it with their best stuff. The worst part is, the worst offenders of the bad design issue are mandatory story bosses, like a certain someone who's name rhymes with Margaret or the star that shall not be named, if you played the game more than a few hours you know. There are also lots of dungeons that lock you in with no way to get out but fighting, no indication on the level or anything so exploring, it is entirely possible to end up stuck somewhere with no way to get out because you're not strong enough to fight, including a trap right in the starting area that could very easily have you stuck if you don't know the path to get out. then you add in bad patches where they remove access to upgrades or things that just made certain mandatory encounters manageable on all builds while leaving in extremely bad things that some bosses can do that they very clearly shouldn't and the community complains about nonstop, or things like PvP that is awful and you're left with a fun but fatally flawed game. It has a lot of good but when the worst part of a Souls game is the bosses, there is a big issue.",0
Negative,its a poorly controlled dark souls. going back to DS3. its this is terrible. it also takes till after the 2 hour mark to realize this. do not buy this game. most ive heard regret it and the ones who say they don't cant give me an actual reason why its good. don't listen t the fanboys.,0
Negative,"this game has to be one of the most unfun fromsoftware games i have ever played, and i have played them all. for the first 5 or so hours the game is fine, just your run of the mill souls game. new bosses around every corner, a since of wonder as you enter a new cave or catacomb. but after limgrave everything just gets dull, reused bosses, boring areas, and empty open world makes this game lose its luster after a while. and not im going to talk about my biggest problems with this game, the horrendus boss design. first i will talk about the bosses, 90% of the bosses in this game are reused. from seems to think ""putting two bosses together in a tiny room will make this boss good"" but its just not fun. walking into a room after walking through a reused dungeon just to see a reused boss, or god forbid two reused bosses in the same room get old after the second time. and they didnt even think about balancing the bosses that you run into, like the godskin duo. two bosses that are super fast, deal too much damage, and can read your imputs does not make a fun boss, it makes a boss that makes you regret buying this game.",0

Negative,"Pretty game, seems to have everything needed to be a future classic.With that said, the controls are hot trash.

Negative,"This negative review is solely based on the stability of the multiplayer experience.If you are purchasing this game because you are looking forward to playing with 1, or 2, of your friends then prepare to be extremely disappointed. My friends and I have spent more hours attempting to connect to and/or remain connected to one another than actually experiencing content. We all started characters together and made it to Liurnia before simply giving up and making solo characters to actually play the game. Connection errors are rampant and we've had as many as 10, between, us in 15 minutes of playtime and many sessions were spent running back to summon a person who disconnected or waiting for them to advance to the point they disconnected to attempt to start playing again. Invasions are even worse on multiplayer as there are times the invader appears to be standing still, but is moving around and attacking - you just can't see it. So your friends are fighting and you get to enjoy just standing there doing nothing until someone dies or disconnects restarting the whole chore of it. Invaders will also disconnect randomly so even if you manage to get an enjoyable PvP experience it might not last through to the end. The stability is so far below what I personally deem acceptable it is impossible for me to recommend it to anyone whose sole purpose is multiplayer or even anyone who looks forward to a co-operative experience.TL;DRIf you're purchasing this game for the solo player experience and you've enjoyed other Souls titles then I have no doubt you will enjoy it. Similarly, if you're buying this game because you want to PvP then you'll likely enjoy it, but far less so. If, however, you're buying this specifically to play with friends then I would strongly recommend against purchasing this game and to seek your fun with another multiplayer title.",0
Negative,"Pretty sure I'm going to get bombed by die-hard fans and veteran for this.First FromSoft game I ever buy and probably the last. I've head good things about the Dark Souls series and want to try to see what the hype is about, was very disappointed. Don't get me wrong, the world and the lore they have built are great. The main problem is the combat.First off, you are way too slow compared to the enemies that you have to fight as well as the things that you can do during combat. At the end of the day, the combat just boils down to ""dodge, dodge, make potshot and back to dodge again"", pretty much rolling around like a tumble weed while your enemy is wailing and dashing around like an anime character. If you want the character to be slow then the bosses also need to be in the same level of movement as your character.Then there's the problem of artificial difficulty, enemies/bosses deal way too much damage, usually kills you in less than 2-3 hits (unless you built much more into survivability) and often times they have a chain of combo attacks that are very hard to read that is a mix of weirdly delayed animation and super fast attack that came out of nowhere.There's probably more problem to the game but I'm not really good at this so I'll just leave it at that. I wanted to refund the game but unfortunately the character creation and the tutorial already took me more than 2 hours, they did it pretty well at the beginning to draw you into the game, but it falls apart later on. Now I'll just try to finish the game since there's no return but I'm not quite having the fun I'm suppose to have.Buy if you're a fan of Dark Souls or just want some unfair challenges.",0
Negative,"The game itself is absolutely great, but its co-op implementation is terrible.I got this game to play co-op, and it has yet to work consistently. There have been networking and performance issues since launch, not to mention that if someone invades your world your co-op partner will be kicked out. Why they do not prioritise the connection with the player you chose to play with I don't know, and there is no option to just do co-op multiplayer - once you open yourself up to multiplayer then you are open to invasions. It is a chore to try to play, especially with the hit-or-miss session joining.we have waited <=10 min around a site of grace multiple times for the summon sign to show up, with absolutely no feedback saying that the connection can't be made. Uninstalling, will try again in 6+ months. If you are wanting to play with friends, I highly suggest waiting for awhile.",0
Negative,"this game is very good, the co-op kinda sucks I would have liked to see them make it more seamless when playing with friends because this is a brand new IP and didn't have to be exactly like the first 3 souls games. What I find infuriating and the reason im giving it a thumbs down is only because the multiplayer in the previous games is still shut off its been months and I could see them just never fixing it to promote sales of elden ring. the modding community had it fixed in a day.",0
Negative,the game is great if it werent for all of the connection issues the game has whether it is the multiplayer or the connection of the controllers. Bought a brand new xbox one controller and yet it has issues disconnecting or you randomly loose functions of all of your buttons or your character randomly while attack or move. These simple issues over shadow the great things that elden ring does provide. It is either Elden Ring or steam either way it needs to be fixed.,0
Negative,real bad. enemies were too hard and i died a lot. would only recommend if you like torturing yourself.,0
Negative,"The PC port of this game is very shoddy. I had to deal with near constant crashes, freezes, and framerate drops to the single digits during my playthrough. I wouldn't be surprised if 5-10% of my playtime was just waiting on the game to unfreeze, or to reboot after a crash.This is a fun game, but a frustrating one even for FromSoft standards. The combat in this game is built on a ""win fast, lose fast"" design philosophy which ends up making bosses feel like monumental obstacles that you manage to cheese, or absolute pushovers with no in between. Additionally, this means that if your build can't reliably delete a boss in a small handful of interactions, it's back to the drawing board for you unless you want to resign yourself to learning a boss inside and out so you can avoid all it's one-hit kill attack patterns.The exploration is really fun, but it's also marred by constantly repeating assets. You'll only need to go through about 3 catacombs before you start seeing repeating rooms that they've snapped together in different configurations, and you'll notice pretty quickly that every ""shack"" location in the game uses the same asset.Don't get me wrong. When this game shines, it SHINES. In my opinion though, these issues make the game not worth investing the full 100+ hours that a solid playthrough demands. Wait for the patches to finish rolling out and for the game to go on sale before picking it up.",0

Negative,"This game is almost a masterpiece. For the first 30 or so hours, it is, and through the whole game it is aesthetically and atmospherically a ten. But, there is a sharp drop in quality. Area design becomes very empty, and the bosses give up on having predictable and preventable damage in favor of using sub-20-frame moves that either kill instantly or do most of your health bar, even at 50+ in the health stat. It's ultimately still an alright game, but it's seriously held back by its weak latter half and bad boss design.",0

I am writing this review with serious intend and anger, i hope i find peace after i played this game. Thanks for killing me.",0
Negative,"UPDATE: They fixed crashing (mostly) and attempted to fix balance.Leaving on negative bc I can.I bought it mostly for pvp, turns out its terrible.

Yeah.Lots of exploits, afk farm spots, broken mechanics and simply bad designs.Phantoms downscaling doesn't work(or it's bad af), Performance is terrible and the net code is at it's worst - desynchronisation issues, connection errors and so on.For multiplayer, dont even think about buying it, in it's current state.For single, great experiance, big world and a lot of stuff to do.Multi/pvp 3,5/10Single 8,5/10",0
Negative,"Was fun for the first 30ish hours, not so much after. The game recycles itself like its a piece of plastic. There are only 9 bosses that are not re-used in this game, the amount of bosses that are fun to fight is even less.Best parts of Elden Ring are the segments in Dark Souls type of locations (Stormveil castle, Capital, etc). Rest of the open world is unarguably beautiful, but is filled with the same tombs/caves with the same enemies with the same bosses, which are ofter just a regular enemy with buffed health and damage. If From Soft cutted out half of the open world with all that filler the game would only get better.If you are a big fan of From Soft games then you will probably like this one as well. Otherwise I recommened getting this on sale a couple years after release. Hopefully by that time the developers will fix most of the technical issues and do some balancing.",0
Negative,"Game is simply not fun once you get to the fire giant.every boss past Mohg/Morgitt is no fun to fight, the areas after this are mostly empty and you have to completely alter your playstyle to some on meta bleed/magic build to deal with the suddenly never ending attack patterns that don't let you get a hit in unless you're using a katana/dagger or magic. Sucks that it took me 100 hours to realize this was not fun.",0
Negative,"By far, the worst game I've spent money on. No guidance, fights can be impossible to win, and there is too much frustration.",0
Negative,Dont get it unless you got good pecs i can run rust but cant even get to the loading screen without it crashing,0
Negative,This game makes me want to kill myself,0
Negative,"This game is in really bad shape and far from ready. New pvp system is horrible. Only single invader vs. 1 host and 2 phantoms as default.Result is ganking only and spamming of weaponart. Recovery times after stun / stagger are shocking slow. Boy, oh boy fromsoft killed poise YET again.You get staggered by simple enemies despite heavy high-poise armor and maxed stamina. Weaponart takes waaay too little FP and stamina. Many bosses are super trivial and only do one single type of attack / weaponart.Sometimes resulting in endless stun that can-not be escaped. Playing with phantoms is very unstable, where the same players were super stable in DS3. Random crashes are just a part of the game, following the mesage that I did not close properly.",0
Negative,"Hard as expected. UI is badly documented and a real tutorial seems to be missing. Easily rectified by using your favorite search engine. Keyboard + mouse works only so-so for me, so this is the first game I play with a game controller, which works pretty well (or not, see update below). World design is pretty nice and you can explore at least parts of the open world without getting killed all the time. That said, enemies do not announce their strength and dying a lot is part of the game.I have had to change this to ""not recommended"". There are traps in this game that you likely cannot get out under certain circumstances. These traps are placed intentionally. This is abysmally bad game design, as you cannot just get back to an older save, but will have to start over with a new game. Genius and madness is apparently close together in the From people. In addition, I now think the game pad controls are pretty bad. Not unusable, but also not competently done. More like they kept the same thing since forever and never looked at how it could be improved. There are also quite a bit of bugs. The PvP networking code seems to be abysmally bad, according to the discussions. I do not use it, so I cannot tell. But I have had several instances now of the game going into an inconsistent state, with double-dying (no chance to recover runes), teleports to the wrong target, teleport-points not activating, etc. In a single-save game, that is really something that must not happen as each of these can destroy your single precious save-game. I think I will have to add a manual backup for myself now. May get me banned though, as the anti-cheat may not agree that I am allowed to do that. Screw-ups on top of screw-ups, obviously enabled by developer arrogance. Of course, also enabled by a community that is quite a bit toxic and seems to believe From Software cannot do wrong, no matter how badly they screw up.So, to sum up: This game is beautiful, but part of its difficulty level comes from some aspects simply being done badly, like the controls and documentation that forces you to find out things yourself. Also, there is a lot of stupid surprises, i.e. things that do not make sense and you simply have to fail once and then remember how you failed. That is not smart game design. That is, at best, memory training and boring. This thing is most certainly not a masterpiece like some people claim. It is not totally bad either, but it would need quite a bit of improvement to rate as ""pretty good"", mostly on the UI and documentation and controls side.Update: I have stopped playing this game completely after about 50h in. The controls are just the most awfull trash I ever experienced in 35 years of gaming on a supposedly AAA title. They keeps screwing me over. Sure, it is common to need, say 10-15h to really get the hang of it, but ""not there yet"" after 50h? That is broken and inexcusable. Hence my final review will be: Does suck you in and then keeps abusing you. Stay away.",0
Negative,"This game doesn't even start. I either get an initialization error due to something with the DLL files or if it does start I get a white screen for 2 seconds and then it crashes to desktop. And I can't get a refund for it, either. Don't buy this for PC unless you want to risk paying for a game you can't even play.",0
Negative,"There are a few complaints I have. Granted this is my first souls-esc game. But, I find for a game series that heard was challenging (which it is) has a lot of gimmicks rather than have clever boss design or strategies. Here are a few things I'm not overly fond of: 1) the limitation of the horse riding is. odd. You can fight mini-bosses on horse but, I have to roll around on the ground instead. No real explanation or reasoning I feel, more just a gimmick to make it harder. So, the premise is ""check out this cool horse! But, you can't use this new feature because that would make it too easy."" 2) As a first time souls player, the story is incredibly difficult to follow and the quest lines overly complicated. As a casual player and someone that doesn't want to have to google or youtube the lore, quest lines, how to progress, it's weird to have Martin come in write the story then have to follow the lore off items. A codex would be interesting, even to see the design of bosses, enemies, and larger pictures of weapons. They're cool looking let me explore. I've heard arguments that this is supposed to have a more realistic feel is if I was spawned into this world I'd have to listen to people and remember things. therefore it's unrealistic to have a codex, quest guide, etc. I find that idea is convoluted as you can carry 80 swords and 30 armour sets, but having a paper and quill in game is too out of this world. 3) The boss spam is real. I find that attack sets of bosses sometimes becomes just ridiculous, for example the sentinel bosses, I had one that spammed 10 straight fireballs point blank with AOE damage, or the beast clergyman spamming the same attack and running over and over. I find it more just tedious that entertaining/ challenging. 4) I like having friends to play with but, there are mass glitches where they will be booted helping me with a boss fight (once again first souls series games, need assistance from time to time). Seems very slow to patch, which I would imagine is something you would want to have working over sorcery is doing too much damage, time to nerf! 5) NPC dialog is terrible. Just to reiterate that one again. Maybe this game was designed more for the souls fans, but I feel as though it's missing key components to make it for more of a broader base of new fans. It's filled with more gimmicks that skill overall. You're met with this incredible scenery to then bet met with lazy combat. How many dragons have the same moveset that I circle for 20 mins to chip away at before I make my point of lazy design? too many to count.",0
Negative,"The Good:The game contains a staggering amount of content, and the first 60% of it is largely very good. There are tons of unique and interesting weapons, spells, summoning ashes, and enemies, along with lots of other little collectables to keep you going. There truly is a sense of wonder as you explore the open world and it always seems there is something interesting to find out in the open. The game world is insanely large, much much bigger than I anticipated, and there are lots of areas that are truly incredible to look at. The weapon and spell variety is honestly staggering, and there were so many weapons that I was so excited to pick up and give a try on another playthough.The ""legacy dungeons"", also known as the human designed dungeons, are all excellent, with tons of interesting routes and side locations to explore. Even on a third playthough, I'm finding new and interesting areas that I'd somehow missed the first two times through. The addition of jumping has also made these areas extremely fun to explore and has given the dev team lots of freedom in designing clever and interesting ways to navigate the gorgeous environments. As can always be expected from a FromSoft game, the art design borders on immaculate. The armor and weapon designs all look cool in a variety of unique ways, so you'll definitely be able to customize your character to look awesome in a way that you're satisfied with. Tons of enemies are recycled from older FromSoft games, but honestly they all have been updated and they look good here. The art design is incredibly cohesive, and the world just feels great to explore. The music is overall good, though at times it seems some tracks are repeated a bit too often. The story, as is to be expected with a FromSoft game, is loosely explained and incredibly cryptic, but it's got that fun hook that makes you want to piece together the lore of the world. Add that together with the outstanding voice acting, and honestly it's a world that's just so cool to inhabit. Character design is also top tier here, with tons of the NPCs being really memorable, both in visual design and in terms of their dialog and voice acting.The Bad:This is by far FromSoft's least balanced game they've ever put out. The latter third of the game is honestly shocking that it was released in the state it is. The game is borderline unplayable for a solo melee build, and it is never communicated to the player, but vigor is really the only that stat in the game that matters. Even saying that, even vigor is a bit useless nearing the end of the game, because even with 60 vigor, wearing max defensive talismans and armor, almost every single boss, and many regular enemies, will still one shot you. Quite a few bosses have more than one instant kill move. Bosses themselves have massively inflated health pools, so if you're playing solo you'll need to damage them for a solid 5 minutes before they'll die. This is further complicated by the fact that the game was clearly never given a balance pass for any kind of solo play, and was just sort of patched over with summoning ashes. Essentially, either you play with the Mimic Tear +10, or you don't get to have fun in the last third of the game, ever.For example, the Deathbird has a massively charged one hit kill explosion move. That's fine. After dying to it once, you'll recognize the beginning of the animation and know to move far away from the explosion. Unfortunately for you, it also instantly shoots fire along the ground in four directions, and if you're hit by this fire, even if you've jumped, you will knocked on the ground and the fire will burn you to death. You cannot get up or move, or react in any way and the fire will do something like three times your maximum health. So you'll just die. So you'll just have to get lucky and hope the next time you dodge away that the fire doesn't clip you. Another example is Vyke, who has a jump which staggers you. This jump has a zero frame startup, so it's not dodgeable in any way. The stagger is also so long that, even if you begin mashing the dodge button the millisecond you see the jump start, you will still get hit by his overhead attack, which will likely one hit kill you. To avoid spoilers, I won't list some of the endgame bosses, but numerous endgame bosses also have completely unfair and frankly unfun mechanics which punish melee builds, defensive builds, and basically anything that isn't intelligence magic or cheese bleed builds. Many bosses have the same problem, which is that there are simply not safe opportunities to attack. Some bosses will string together combos that over 10 hits long, and if you dodge them all perfectly, they'll just immediately start another combo. This will often mean that attacking even once after ten perfect dodges will see you getting hit. It essentially railroads you into using the Mimic Tear or Tiche to soak damage and aggro, and if you're trying to play it solo, you're going to find the majority of the end to be straight unplayable. In addition, for reason I honestly cannot fathom, they put incredibly blatant input reading into the game, so bosses will always frame-perfectly punish you for healing. Combine with their long combo strings, numerous delayed attacks, and branching attack patterns, you are essentially punished for every single action you take, and there are never rewards in combat since bosses are almost never open to being attack.Unfortunately, all the variety I mentioned in the beginning is completely negated by the end of the game, because almost all weapons and spells are complete garbage by the end game. If you're not using one of the completely broken bleed builds, you're not going to be beating a lot of the content in the game (unless you're using int magic with the mimic tear). Any spell with any amount of windup is going to be useless solo, since poise is functionally worthless in this game, so you will be knocked out of every single spell cast that isn't instant. Though even if you could poise through enemy attacks, the damage numbers are tuned so high at the end that you'd be guaranteed to die anyways.I'm not sure if they simply didn't have enough time to balance the end of the game, or if they have some bizarre idea that people like the souls games because they're hard, so more hard equals more good, but either way, the last third of this game is an unfun slog. I beat it three times, and I just hated the last third every time. Every time I step through the fog gate, I just groan because I know it's going to be thirty attempts until I finally give in and just use the mimic tear to cheese the boss. It sucks because there are cool designs here, but you won't get to experience them in any fun or interesting way. You'll just bang your head against the wall until you finally just throw in the towel and call in the Mimic Tear to save you. A lot of the fun and satisfaction of beating bosses is lost this way, since outplaying them solo is so incredibly tedious and crushingly difficult.It sucks to FromSoft's balance backslide so far Dark Souls I. I've beaten all the FromSoft games numerous time, and I've killed all the optional bosses - I've killed the Nameless King, Friede, Isshin. These were all very hard, but fair and fun fights. They didn't rely on cheap one hit kills to artificially make the game feel harder. FromSoft has certainly had some bad bossfights in prior entries, and I've felt they've stepped over the line with difficulty a few times in their older games, but honestly nothing compares to how outrageous the difficulty gets at the end of Elden Ring.Closing Thoughts:In the end, this game has a ton of potential. If FromSoft puts in the effort to fix some of the glaring balance problems, this has the potential to be one of the best games in their catalog, and maybe in the last decade. But as it stands, one of the most overpowering emotions I associate this game with is frustration and annoyance.",0
Negative,"Too many random crashes and connection errors, fix these problems. They are ruining the game.",0
Negative,"Until the performance improves, I couldn't recommend this.",0
Negative,Will you please fix the game game is so broken but you guys won't do anything to fix it all there is in PvP is just a bunch of the same thing rivers of blood moon veil madness like fr what are you doing to this game you guys won't fix it and playing for this long would hope something would be done but nope nothing to fix the game still great game guys happy I spent $60 and spent so much of my time on this stupid game,0
Negative,Great game in all aspects except that opening co-op sessions will force you to pvp and it looks like the game community likes to grief new players with really cancerous builds and tricks that grants them advantages. Kills the fun of friendship exploration.,0
Negative,"but throughout my adventure I faced massive frame drops/stutters, infinite loading screens, random crashes, and constant issues with the multiplayer functionality. This is more of a PC problem, as FS's ports are unfortunately never well done, though this one was worse than DS3. It felt like I was on a time limit before FROM decided to boot me from my friend's server, or vice versa. I attempted some fixes that others suggested as I'm not the only one this happens to, but no dice. For the times I was actually able to stay in the lobby for an extended amount of time, I noticed that the co-op experience was lackluster as the moment your friend joins, you lose the ability to mount up making the experience dreadfully slow. I wish they would've given an option to stick around if an overland/dungeon boss is eliminated. Constant summoning gets old, especially if all you defeated was aNight's Cavalry. The worst part is that there are fixes created by the community but in order to use them, you have to disable the anti-cheat, removing the ability to play multiplayer. So until FS tweaks modding or fixes it themselves, I just have to deal with it. If they do fix it, I'll change my review.Side note, I hate how easy it is to fail or miss quests, but that is a Soulsborne classic at this point. I can get over the tight quest lines but what is more frustrating are the ones they left unfinished, leaving you very confused on what to do next. They are adding in missing parts of the quests as the game gets patched but again, only parts.",0
Negative,"I love that this game isnt full of microtransactions, i enjoy the allowing me to explore without holdong my hand, and it is beautiful. The jank is too much for me. I beat most of the other fs titles witgout problem or too much rage, its not a matter of git gud. I just finished ng+4.I tried to like it, the first half of the game is awesome but its last chunk just falls apart, and the laziness pf boss design and challenge in general is increasingly apparent longer you play. The subtlety that made me love (most) of the bosses of previous fs titles is gone. The new game is waiting around to hit an endless combo and AOE machine once and then waiting a minute or two to hit them again, once. Its clear this is meant to cope with the addition of ashes, but for us oldschool folks that like to solo these games, the new design is tedious. Not hard, not challenging anything but my patience. I also dont like that it seems to try to steer you towards farming over exploration, and there might be less npc interaction and quests in this game than in orevious FS titles, which is wild given the size of it.It just feels empty after a bit. Lot of the items and gear feels useless to me also. The difference between the worst, middle of the road and best armors feels pretty minimal. Magic is probably the strongest its ever been, bows ate betyer than they have been, but melee feels jankier to me than in previous games, dont know what it is. The early game is among the best theyve ever done, and middle to end is much weaker. Thats all aside from the frequent problems just getting it to work, which have been pretty constant. Hope other folks have abetter tine with it than i did, but i honestly say wait and if you do pick it up get it on sale in a year.",0
Negative,"Elden Ring is a great game marred by very fixable issues. The game has bright spots here and there but it's a 1 step forward 2 steps back kind of game. There is nothing wrong with an open world Souls game, but this one does it quite poorly. Elden Ring loves to copy paste mini dungeons, bosses, and landmarks. You will very quickly find the same shack, catacombs, caves and enemies over and over. The world does not have the attention to detail that previous games had. Even the legacy dungeons suffer from a lack of variety of enemies and careful design. The most egregious part is that exploration is very rarely rewarded. Elden Ring features proper jumping, but it is uncommon to find any items in places that you can jump or even walk to. If you do find a item, 80% of the time it will be a consumable soul or crafting material that you can find everywhere. There are so few unique items in the game that I have less after 170 hours of gameplay than I'd have in 40 of previous games. Even when you find 'unique' items, you'll find that many are the same item with a different color and slightly different special effect. Ignoring that, you'd think that the game would at least be fun in coop, but you'd be wrong. Elden Ring goes out of its way to ruin your fun. You will get kicked out after every single boss, even ones in the open world, meaning that you'll have to find your friend again to start coop again. There is no rhyme or reason for this, just pure incompetence from the developer. Occasionally, you will find yourself locked out of coop altogether. You will be killing bosses with your friends and eventually discover that you can no longer do coop because you have killed all the arbitrary key bosses in the area. This is an issue that was already solved 8 years ago in Dark Souls 2. If you lock yourself out of coop then you will stuck doing large amounts of content in solo. You will be exploring only to find an arbitrary 'fog wall', meaning that you will have to end your coop session and restart it literally a foot away from the wall. To top it all off, the multiplayer servers barely work over a month after the game's release. You will spend hours trying to connect to your friends only to get kicked when it does work (or even suspended if your game crashes too many times). The gameplay isn't the only area where the game is lacking because the PC port is abysmal. It is FromSoftware's worst PC port since the infamous Dark Souls PTDE, featuring a 60 fps cap, anticheat that prevents mods but doesn't prevent cheaters, poor keyboard and mouse support, still lacks a FOV slider, and the game itself will repeatedly stutter because the game doesn't precache shaders due to it's poor implementation of DirectX12. If you are interested in this game, don't buy it now. It's a good entry point for newcomers but poor for Souls veterans. The game is significantly easier than previous games, featuring bosses that can be killed in single digit seconds. This game is a poor Souls game. It may be fixed with changes via modding or a Scholar of the First Sin style redo, but it isn't worth the asking price right now, especially when FromSoftware/Bandai Namco won't acknowledge or fix the server issues even a month after release.",0
Negative,"I've played this game for well over 100 Hours and I've enjoyed like 20 of them. The story is basically invisible unless you do research outside of the game, which I won't do. The game plays like the bad guys were all built by six year old's who hadn't agreed on the rules before they started playing, and I have never hated a pet/mount/side-kick as much as I do that horse, bro is mostly a detriment and has the personality of a cardboard cut-out of a horse with horns glued on. Also, why do all of the knights have jousting plates on their armor when there are no lances (not an issue, just odd looking)? I beat DS III, so I'm fine with a challenge, but if you expect me to be 100% precise in all of my moves and attacks it is only fair if less than 10% of enemies can injure you with the sheer force of the air from their attacks.",0
Negative,"Honestly loved this game had 200 hours into it. however when my account gets banned for half a year because an invader drops me an item that is gained by a cheat engine. no thank you i was not aware of this item, i was playing my game and get repercussions for something im not aware of so now i cannot play with friends. i understand that dealing with each issue is a big job but no way of lifting a 6 month ban for tampering with a game when i haven't no thank you. i would ordinarily recommend this phenomenal game, but honestly they can shove it for banning me from online play for 6 months for something i haven't done. the bright side is they have good anti cheat so much so that someone who doesn't cheat receives a ban ggs i guess. don't accept shit from invaders because clearly you get screwed for nothing.",0

Negative,"Don't buy this game for the co op. Originally i wasn't very interested in this game since I was never a huge souls fan. When the reviews started coming out and i saw that they were mostly positive I was getting more interested. My friend then bought the game and because it was advertised as a co op game he convinced me to buy it as well . We thought it would be lot of fun to just be stuck at bosses for hours and to hear eachother rage. But little did we know that the co op is absolutely horrible. You basically have to join in your friends' world but you really can't do anything while you're there. You can't replenish healing items, you can't progress the story together and when someone dies you are returned to your own world and have to rejoin. When you look the game up on steam it even says online co op but this really isn't a part of the game at all. I find all of this very strange since they even used the co op part in most advertising pieces saying it was much better and very expansive but that is just a blatant lie. So if you're looking to buy this game for the co op just don't. If you don't care about the co op at all then go ahead my friend told me he enjoys the game a lot.",0

WARNING: The bug did not appear in the game until more than 2 hours of gameplay, therefore if you purchase this game and get the bug steam will refuse your refund.",0
Negative,"Don't see what all the hype was about. If you don't like Dark Souls games, don't get this. It's definitely not at all like Skyrim or even remotely similar in any way like some people say it is. The game is designed to torture players, like Dark Souls. You will just constantly get killed by anything and everything, a lot. Probably wouldn't be so bad if the controls didn't feel like you had a 200 pound free weight strapped to your head.Update:Played to completion. Got gud. Didn't repec and lived with my consequences. Solo'd all bosses except the last one. This game is total garbage. Here's why: - If you don't know the story to Dark Souls or whatever, you're not learning it in the game. I had no clue what was going on and still don't. The ending was awful. I looked up all the endings and they're all awful. - The controls feel like you have a 200 pound weight strapped to your head that will whip lash you. It purposely drops targets that are a direct threat to you. - EVERY BOSS has a ""Final Form"". - EVERY mob has some kind of one shot kill. You die a lot. I knew that going in. - You can't really hang out with your buddies because some jerk will always invade. You don't have a choice, you have to fight the invader. - The camera is more difficult than any boss and will get you killed a lot. The game was so unfulfilling. You bust your chops to get to the end and you get a bootleg Conan the Barbarian ending for all of 10 seconds. I don't care if I spoiled it. This game sucks. Fight me.",0
Negative,"its a boring repetitive game, theres nothing to keep you hooked and the idea a game is fun just because its bassically challenging is the most idiotic idea of making a game. not everyone is a hardcore player, and some people dont like having to repeat a boss 40+ times because of bs deaths. the game is not worth the 10/10 and definetly not worth 60 bucks.",0
Negative,"This game is so utterly bug-ridden that it makes enjoying it a near impossibility. The performance tanks arbitrarily and excessively, the game crashes repeatedly when attempting multiplayer, bosses and certain attacks don't just crash the game but CRASH THE GRAPHICS DRIVER, and multiplayer has cheats in it that forbid you from ever playing with people again.Overall, it's a pretty good game. Demand better out of your developers and their godawful ports.",0
Negative,"Edit after patch 1.4; The game is running much better, however there are still some places where the game hitches and stalls on a few frames during combat or while adventuring. Its more playable now, but the issue is not gone, and its all very hardware specific who gets problems or not, so not sure if others are getting better experience yet either. My original review is below, for patches 1.2 and 1.3Bad port, optimized horribly. 100 hours of logged on steam, of that I would say 40 hours have been spent just troubleshooting perfomrance and frame drops, spikes, hitches, and lag. I would not recomend this game until performance problems have been fixed. I have a good PC, ryzen7 2700, rtx 2070 super, 32gb of ram, nvme ssd drive, this game should not be stuttering the way it is, every other game I have tried with this setup runs fine, or atleast the graphics can be tweaked to have it run at 60+ fps consistantly without stuttering. No matter what graphics settings I use, third party programs, or nvidia settings, I get stuttering and frame rate/input latency issues. From soft please fix this game and I will change ratting to thumbs up.also, at 100 hours in the game crashed and it corrupted my save file, i have tried everything to get back my save progress but nothing worked, had to restart and lose 100 hours of progress",0

Apparently, this is a relatively common problem and there is no fix for this. Playing this game for all that time turned out just to be a waste. I will definitely not take the risk of trying again on a new account. Hopefully Steam will refund the game because playing Elden Ring turned out to be such a waste of time.",0

Like, I have a job. I have a family. I already have stress. I don't need more stress. I want gaming to be an escape, a social experience, not high-investment. I want to turn my brain off and just enjoy my gaming time. Elden Ring is not that. I honestly only put in this many hours because of peer pressure - so many people swearing it's the best ever and I kept thinking ""maybe it'll click for me after hour 10, after hour 20, after hour 30."" and it honestly just hasn't ever arrived. Maybe after hour 100?

Negative,"**No major spoilers, item names are partially censored**Okay so let's get the elephant in the room out of the way first. Is the game fixed? No. No it isn't. I still have game breaking bugs, frequent frame drops, and the game has been worse than Cyberpunk 2077 on launch for me. But that's not why I'm putting a negative review on the game. As a matter of fact, it doesn't even factor into my opinion. Why? Because the intentional and functional parts of the game are much worse than bugs.This review is coming from the standpoint of someone who has beaten every FromSoft game except Sekiro and Demon's Souls. Combining all my runs together I have about 20 different complete files over 10 years. I'd like to think I know a thing or two about what one should expect from a game in the family. I've played Elden Ring using dexterity, strength, spellsword, and faith. So let's find out why I give this game a 6.5/10 and feel you should wait for the DLC edition to purchase.Let's start off with the best Elden Ring has to show.Item variety and customization:Without a doubt the best the franchise has ever offered in every way from character creation to the amount of weapons, armor, items, and skills. Yeah that's right, skills. This is by far the coolest customization feature in Elden Ring because you can take almost any weapon that isn't a boss/legendary weapon (and I think some of them as well) and put a wide variety of abilities on them. Combos, buffs, spells and more can go onto your weapons and whetstones can be found to allow the change of attributes like blood, poison, magic, or scaling enhancements. This alone means that there are multiple times more possible builds to play with in this game and is an amazing groundwork for replayability in soulsborne fans returning to The Lands Between. Crafting is hit and miss, some recipes cost too much, some are seemingly impossible to create until certain points in the game. (The meat recipe you get at the very start asks for a midgame only item for some reason.) Generally it's a welcome alternative to farming souls for items, which you can still do, eventually. A lot of items still feel utterly useless and a lot of items still feel utterly broken.Bosses:This game has the most unique bosses out of the franchise and houses give or take 5 bosses I would consider all-time greats. That's where my praise for the bosses of this game ends. It's atrocious how many times bosses have been reused. Reused as an identical boss, reused as a reskin with a couple new moves, reused as a gank boss, reused as regular enemies, hell, even reused as **NPCs.** Some bosses are overtuned to extremes and some bosses feel like they received no playtesting at all. I have actually killed multiple bosses in **5 or less hits** at average level with a normal build. Bosses have a pixel perfect hitbox which causes projectiles to go under their armpits and angled attacks to give them a fresh back hair shave without doing damage. Short ranged attacks will miss often on huge bosses because their upper body pushes you away from the attackable area. The game is at it's best when the enemy is no bigger than 4 times your size. But be prepared for 10x+ size differences and wall clipping/being glitch-pushed in some of these horribly designed bosses.Gank fights feel as if the pitch meeting went like this: Miyazaki: ""We have this zone, I don't want to make a unique boss for it, what should we do?"" Some guy: ""Just take this boss from that other zone and multiply it. Or we take two bosses that don't compliment eachother whatsoever and put them together."" Miyazaki: ""Genius. I do love Gargoyles and Ornstein."" Except they didn't put in any effort to make gank fights flow like Gargoyles or Ornstein. They are just two (or more) solo bosses that come at you at the same time with all they have. It feels like those fights are designed accounting for at least one summon. Spirit summons are hit or miss on bosses, sometimes they are useless and sometimes they carry, but an acquaintance in the community told me that he summoned M**** Tear and literally just sat there while it killed a boss he couldn't get himself.You will think I'm lying to you when I say this, but there is one fight in particular where you fight 2 sets of 2 different solo bosses that were already previously grouped together as a duo. That makes 4 bosses in one room. You might think I'm pointing this out because it makes everything way too hard, but no. That boss took me one death. For the most part, this is the easiest game they've released thus far. It's just not fun when the boss design, if you can even call it that, is lazy. They clearly made too much map and weren't up to the task of filling it all with good content. I'm not even asking for it to be filled with unique content, just something that showed some clear effort went into it. Right now at least half the game is lacking that expected level of quality. It would genuinely be a better product if at least half the bosses were cut from the game. More is less here, for sure.TL;DR A couple of the best bosses on offer, a whole load of bottom tier bosses that are a chore to even bother killing.Balance:For the most part nonexistent in any sense of the word. A lot of random enemies have egregious HP pools and two hit me in medium armor with 1300 HP. That amount of HP would be baby mode in any other game but in this one it's almost the bare minimum, with most builds calling for between 1450 and 1900. All kinds of completely unbalanced builds are available to the player as well, and nothing has been more damaged by that than PVP, which is currently in it's worst state since DS1. The following information assumes you don't look up ""Elden Ring meta build"" and pick the most broken thing you see. In other soulsborne games, you outscale the trash that litters the area as you approach endgame and you feel your character becoming an unstoppable force, when you started the game struggling to kill soldiers with shields. In this game, everything **except** the player character does this. After midgame, mobs gets disproportionate HP and damage, and it gets to the point where you've gone full circle and it feels like you're back to the start of the game struggling to get behind a simple shield without dying instantly.However they have found a way to make archery viable in most scenarios, so props for that feat that no other FromSoft game could accomplish for some reason. Just be prepared to farm a **LOT** of ammo over the course of the game. Killing one boss with a pure range build could take 200+ depending on accuracy, potency, and boss HP.Level design: Praise the jumping, because they absolutely take advantage of it when making their areas in this game. Much to my displeasure in some cases. Verticality abounds in these areas, always look for places you can reach by jumping or falling. I've gotten lost for more than 20-30 minutes at a time looking for the way forward sometimes, but whether that's poor design or me being stupid is up for debate. For the most part the feeling of exploration is there, but I swear the devs get a kick out of placing worthless items in the most treacherous areas. Some rooms have the most pitiful challenge lurking within them, some rooms you could die to more than the boss of the area. Ambushes are so omni-present that whenever you have a blind spot you might as well assume there's two guys waiting there for you and three of their buddies on the ceiling. Rarely is a challenge ever presented by ambushes in this game, simply annoyances and often straight up insults of your perception. All the dungeons except a few might as well be identical. All the same assets, all the same enemies, all the same small pool of dungeon bosses.I've ran out of review space and I still have twice as much left to say that is negative about this game. If that isn't enough to stop you until the GotY edition with DLC, just buy the game.",0

Negative,"From Software makes great games. I have played nearly every one of their souls games: Demon's Souls, Dark Souls I, II, and III. Unfortunately I can't give Elden Ring a positive review. Not until it supports ultrawide screens. I mean, it's 2022. It ought to be expected for any major title by now.",0
Negative,"Unpopular opinion here, for DS old players the main game loop feels boring and the world kind of empty. If you played the DS trilogy this game is considerable easier then those games, there is no Humanity mechanism, meaning there is no health penalty for dying too much, the common enemies are really easy to farm and they yield lots of souls (yes for me they are still souls, runes is a dumb name). Your character can be significantly OP before level 40. You can raise the challenge a bit by playing offline but still it's no where near Dark Souls challenge. Some bosses are cool but they added a lot of ""mini"" bosses to serve as a farming point and they feel really unnecessary and add not to the story. The story as always is really confusing and abstract on purpose. Overall it feels like a dumb down Dark Souls with a way too empty feeling open world to give you the sense that there is some meaning where there is none. Also after so many years there is no official ultrawide support so you either play with black bars on both sides or use a flawless widescreen to fix it but then you cannot play online.",0
Negative,"Elden Ring is an incredible game, but it is brought down by extremely poor optimization for PC. I love what I have played, but the game crashes constantly and the performance is abysmal. For example, I have a Ryzen 7 5800x, 32gb of ram, and an RTX 3070ti. I get about 45fps at 1440p medium settings, with extreme frame drops every few seconds. In a game where the difference between beating a difficult boss and dying for the millionth time is made by timing dodges perfectly, these frame drops can be the difference between life and death. It is extremely frustrating and disappointing. If you have a low or mid-range PC, forget about it. This is so painful because I love the game but it's like From Software wants to keep me from playing it. If you have a console, do yourself a favor and buy the game there, as your experience will be better in every way. Even though I love this game, I just can't recommend it in its current state on PC. P.S. It makes you hit ""quit game"" which sends you to the title screen where you can then quit to the desktop. If you do alt+f4 (or when it crashes, which is how the game closes most of the time) it sends you a warning message that you did not quit correctly and you could lose progress. Seriously From Software? You can't just let me quit to desktop from the game? C'mon.",0
Negative,"Look, there's very little chance you're seeing this review unless you've filtered the view to negative. Perhaps you're looking for reasons not to spend $60. Maybe you're just looking to hand out free steam points by giving jesters to negative reviews that get your panties all twisted up. It doesn't matter.At this point, I personally feel that From has fallen prey to their own reputation for making ""difficult"" games. This game is Dark Souls 3.5, but with stupid amounts of copy-pasted bosses and mid- to late-game encounters that will one or two shot you back to a bonfire even if you're at the soft cap for Vigor and wearing the heaviest armor in the game.Roll-spamming stopped being a meme and is now simply expected of players; at the same time, bosses have long, often poorly telegraphed and absurdly delayed attack strings with no stamina constraints whatsoever, designed with the explicit intent of faking you out at all times and inflating the difficulty. Note that when I say ""delayed"", I'm talking about bosses leaping into the air for an aerial slam attack and just. hovering there for no reason before coming down. And let's not forget their ability to track player movement by pivoting like a turret during any of these attacks, because that's how momentum works.Once upon a time, dodging attacks was a high-risk, high-reward strategy. If you succeeded, you could spank the boss a bit. If you screwed up, it hurt. In this game, your opportunity to counterattack is almost nonexistent, and screwing up usually means instant death. Meanwhile, the bosses get to play with Sekiro controls, and you're stuck with Dark Souls controls. Sure, that's a challenge. but it also feels bad.Mind you, all that crap I just complained about is only relevant if you melee without summons. Even the hardest encounters in this game are trivialized by speccing into offensive magic and/or summons. Seriously, it feels like a complete 180. You either gain the ability to annihilate the boss with magic missiles and rocks, or summon a brain-dead NPC with inflated health as a punching bag. Hell, you may as well do both.Is this a bad game? I don't know. I guess not, considering I've played around 100 hours, and it is by no means unbeatable. But if I'd known what the game was actually like before purchasing it, I never would have spent those 100 hours of my life on it, at least not at full price.",0

Negative,"TL;DR: Elden Ring is a decent open-world RPG, plagued by awkward design decisions, too much copy & paste content, and an at times frustrating approach to difficulty.The experience between the open world and legacy dungeons is quite different. You traverse much of the open world on back of your ox-horse, Torrent. The world itself is vast and aesthetically diverse; with many things to see, fight and discover. The day & night cycle adds additional immersion, as well as the possibility to discover events exclusive to the time of day.The legacy dungeons function as locales that feature more traditional From Software level design. While nowhere near as vast as the open world locations, these dungeons are intricately-woven networks of progress routes and shortcuts that are a true joy to explore and fight your way through. For me, they were the clear highlight of the game.Looking back at FromSoft s previous titles, I would happily consider most* of their boss fights tough but fair. I can t say the same of many of Elden Ring s bosses. The damage these bosses put out is almost on the level of Sekiro, where you can regularly get 2-3 hit even if you have capped out your HP at maximum. This alone wouldn t be as big of an issue, if all damage was avoidable. Unfortunately, that is not the case (esp. late-game), as many enemies have attack strings that last 7+ hits with lingering AoE hitboxes, that you simply do not have the stamina to dodge out of or block. This means, that you will likely suffer many cheap deaths while you learn from which attacks you need to run away from and which attacks you can block & dodge. The existence of one-shot grab attacks doesn t exactly help here, either, and neither do sheer amount of gank squad, 2-3 bosses vs the player fights.In the late-game this problem gets exacerbated by bosses having myriads of sweeping AoE attacks, followed by long-distance teleport moves that severely punish melee combat to the point where you spend more time chasing after the boss, than you do actually fighting it. There are a grand total of 2 bosses that are harder for spellcasters. Most other bosses feel SIGNIFICANTLY easier on a ranged character than in melee.Compared to many of From s previous bosses, the Big Bads in Elden Ring can oftentimes come across as cheap and unfair and, unlike their other games, don t feel that fun to fight.While previous From Software games occasionally had enemies that would read & react to your actions, Elden Ring is loaded with enemies that input read you like no tomorrow. Oftentimes you will find yourself knocked out of your drinking animation if you don t put significant distance between you and the enemy. You ll regularly get hit out of your jumping attack by enemies that immediately react with a counter attack as soon as you hit the jump button and the list goes on. This isn t reserved to just bosses, lots of regular enemies function this way and it feels extremely frustrating. The game really shines here. There are many weapon types that scale with different attributes, and the ability to re-scale many weapons with whatever attribute you value the most via whetstones is a wonderful addition to tailoring the experience to your liking. The addition of jumping attacks and guard counters greatly increases your options for combat, and various ashes of war let you access brilliant-looking and powerful moves (albeit some are difficult to utilise well, as their animation times are long and have no hyper armour). Spells are split between Intelligence and Faith, with some sub-types of spells even requiring both stats, rewarding builds that utilise both. Interestingly in Elden Ring, Faith is not just the domain of lightning, but also all forms of fire, blood, bestial and dragon incantations; while Intelligence governs Frost, Sleep, Gravity, Night and Death in addition to traditional sorceries. Both Intelligence and Faith feature a huge library of spells.The Arcane stat governs, besides your chance to find items, the build-up speed of status effects such as bleed, poison and rot. With a stat dedicated to this, you can even create builds specifically tailored around statuses!The game features similar online experiences to their previous titles: Co-op, invasions and dueling are all present. Perhaps as a first in series history, invasions are skewed against the invader, as they can only invade people who are actively co-oping; meaning the invader will always be outnumbered. You likely heard that Elden Ring sports a formidable 160+ bosses, which is absolutely true! However, if you look at all the bosses that exist, only eight (9 if we are being generous) are UNIQUE. Every other boss is re-used, re-purposed, re-coloured and sometimes just lobbed about like a regular enemy in later game areas. Every side dungeon has a boss that you ll inevitably meet in another side dungeon, just with more health and, if lucky, differently coloured armour.The open world is fun to explore, but if we take off our FromSoft-coloured shades, it is not that different from your run-of-the-mill open world. Every area sports the same repeated types of locale: Churches that always have flask-enhancing items; a minor Erdtree that always features the same boss with scaled health, for even more flask-enhancing items; various camps filled with human enemies that wear different surcoats but are otherwise mostly identical; a couple places with monstrous enemies that are more unique to the area; a number of small dungeons; and 1-2 legacy dungeons.The game has so much repeated content, and seeing this come from a studio that used to meticulously craft not just the environs but also their inhabitants to tell a story is very disappointing. Unique enemies that have a backstory tied to a locale are later repeated and plastered in different zones, with complete disregard of the enemy s part in the story-telling. It gets even worse with boss fights, as mentioned above. The most exuberant example of this is a late-game ruin that is populated by multiple instances of an enemy that was fought as a boss earlier. A unique character, reduced to a copy-and-paste mob. To drive the point home even further: Another boss is repeated sixteen (16) times throughout the game!The game features multiple endings, as well as NPC quest-lines with mutually-exclusive choices, promoting replayability to see the full content. As usual, you also have a NG+ cycle that features up to 7 iterations of scaling, although there is no change in enemy layout or item placement between cycles. With the sheer amount of possible builds you could do, the replayability is quite high.The game has been plagued by performance woes since its launch in late February. To date, we had a couple patches that have, unfortunately, done very little to improve performance. The biggest issue by far is the frame lag, that occurs very often, especially in the open world. While your framerate looks solid, the game suddenly slows down as if it was running at 20-30 FPS. When we remember that FromSoft games tie their animations to their framerate, this can oftentimes lead to your unfortunate demise as you now have to readjust to a severely slowed-down gameplay experience for a couple seconds. This is subject to change, obviously, and hopefully will be fixed in the future. While enjoyable, the design approach to boss fights and repetition make this FromSoftware weakest entry so far.",0
Negative,"I don't get it.I really don't. At first i thought learning the moveset of a boss to be able to anticipate the next move or attack, so you can properly dodge it and therefore have an actual learning curve against the boss is mandatory in these Souls like games. (This is the first time i started one.)So i got in with this in mind. I wouldn't be bothered dying to a boss, since it is part of the game. Even though there is nothing worse for me to die in a game if death means absolutely fucking nothing.But no. It doesn't matter. You could continue to study the moveset of bosses in this game for 3 weeks and you will never be able to do what you are supposed to do, because the bosses always suddenly change their attack pattern, fake out an attack, charge an attack longer so you dodge roll for nothing and get hit. (Btw. The nanosecond of immunity is a damn joke. Nothing else.)You most of the time have three or maybe four options you can do. Build your character to one of the most broken builds that are on the net right now, so you pretty much don't even be bothered trying to learn an non existant attack pattern or telegraph of attack. Start depending on sheer luck that the boss always perfectly plays in your hands.You grind yourself up to a point were getting hit a few times doesn't matter.Or you use one of the few glitches to mess with the AI, so you can get cheap shots in.I know diehard Soulsfans will cry up because someone is giving this game a negative review, but it has to be. I'm not gonna jerk off From Software for this. It's not hard, because the bosses take time to learn. It's hard because there IS nothing to learn. Yeah you might understand bosses attacks and figure out that after that you have a better chance to attack, but it means fuck all when the boss suddenly turns arround in that one split second you have an attack window and ignores all laws of physics (i mean they do anyway, but even more than they should)No. I had fun till i started to try to fight bosses more serious. I wanted to give a Souls game a proper chance in my life, because i wanted to understand what the constant hype is about. Again. I had fun. I really had it. But not only does the entire performance tank after the latest patch, where it ran butter smooth for so long, but now i even have to deal with freezes. (It has nothing to do with my system. I changed nothing. I even lowered settings and nothing changed.)Not saying you can't have fun with this game. But it's NOT a masterpiece. To repeat it. I would have been able to understand frustration from trying to learn a moveset of a boss. But there is none. I can't play the game how i would like to play it, because unless i am willing to sit 6 hours in front of the game trying to wait for that one luckys try where the boss fucks up completely, i will not gather any skill or anything. Skill would be to learn the pattern or movements of a boss and realize when to attack and when you should not. But this means nothing if the boss at any moment can suddenly do something he has never done before or charge an extra second, even though you had the timing in your muscle memory perfect already. It means nothing to perfectly dodge an attack, if the boss just does an AoE attack you can't escape in a nanosecond afterwards, because you are still midst animation of your dodge. I will try it at a later patch again. Hoping that the performance isn't utter garbage anymore. Maybe even that helps a bit to finally fight bosses normally. But i highly doubt it. If you now sit in front of your screen and angrily shake your fist at this review, being pissy because someone dares to use critical thinking on your beloved game, then all i can say to you is:You're welcome. :)Now to the real reason. The biggest problem i have with the game is the performance. The first few days the game ran flawlessly on 1440p max Settings. Even putting it up to 4k it ran at a near constant 60 FPS. Then a patch came along and suddenly even at 1080p low settings i can't get a constant 60 FPS anymore. Let alone the freezes once the game gets a bit hectical. Yes a 1080 TI isn't a ""high end"" card anymore these days, but the fact that it ran just fine the first days shows you, that it isn't my systems fault. Even updated all the drivers and what not. Once they finally fix the perfromance issues i will change the review to a positive one, since i still really like the game. Love it even. But it isn't a damn masterpiece.",0

Negative,"Played DS1, Sekiro, not a souls fan-boy. In summary, Elden Ring is a decent game, but flawed in so many ways that it does not deserve the critical acclaim it has received. After playing for 70 hours, I finished the crumbling farum azula, and completing most of the major optional dungeons, I can honestly say I enjoyed Ranni's questline, Raykar's fight, but I can no longer bring myself to finish the main storyline as the gameplay experience has been dull and repetitive for the past 20 hours or so. I can say I did enjoy 1/2 of my time on this game, the other 1/2 was me hoping that there are things more interesting at the end of the tunnel.Open World - Vast and visually appealing for the most part, but empty and repetitive after the first 20 hours or so. The freedom of exploration is, truly free, but not designed well enough to connect the threads in meaningful ways. Mechanics - Sekiro being a more mechanically focused game felt better in combat, but understandably it's far easier to optimize than Souls or Elden Ring, given they have so many more build varietyBoss fights - Generally consist of memorizing their unique move-sets and dodge roll, with very little to no gimmicks that gives you pleasant surprises. You rinse and repeat this memory exercise for the next boss, which I can see the appeal to some people, and it was somewhat satisfying in Sekiro, but simply a downgraded experience overall in Elden Ring. Audio - just ambient or atmospheric background noise, almost non-existent to warrant a comment.Story / Lore - I get that storytelling through ambiguous in-game dialog and item descriptions is the soul-style, and honestly I enjoyed most of it. But the design of it can be more cohesive to better immerse the players in the gravity of new encounters before the encounters, rather than after.",0
Negative,"BEFORE I BEGIN It's my first Souls game, so i have a fresh take on it. It's my opinion, feel free to disagree.I don't play PvP.I like when games don't spoon feed you with a checklist of tasks, but instead you have to dig through the game to find what to do.Elden Ring takes this approach, but the complete lack of a journal made it difficult to keep track of my progress.I would have liked to have a journal that tracks all the dialogues for every NPC (while not being a boring checklist of things to do, but still something to rely on when i'm following multiple questlines).I know you can go back every time and re-listen to the NPCs, but it's very impractical.I found the story to be overall unappealing. That comes from the lack of a journal (reasons mentioned above) that would have encouraged me to progress through the quests.The questlines themselves are mostly short and unattractive. Even the longer ones are very repetitive and required me to go back and forth between the same places multiple times.They just felt like a waste of time, with uninteresting backstories.There are a couple of exceptions to this, but overall there is a very small amount of quests and the story felt very dull.There are no factions in the game, very disappointing.I would have expected different factions with different questlines that potentially intertwine, but all i found was some girls in the wild in need of help.The game made it very enjoyable for me to explore around the map and discover secrets hidden in secluded location.But that's where the fun ends, sadly.Although the game is an open world, it felt dead: it's just full of enemies and bosses randomly scattered in the wild, without random NPCs or villages that would help the game feel alive and provide small tasks to carry out while taking a break from the main questline.This kept reminding me in a very unnatural way that the game revolves around the player. I know it wouldn't particularly fit with the setting/story but i think it's a missed opportunity.The game doesn't scale with the player's level, this marks a very precise path of gradual increase in difficulty for the player to take.The problem with that is that, unless you skip huge areas of the game, you'll find yourself overlevelled and the game becomes extremely easy to beat.It felt like going through a tunnel, you can't just say ""in this playthrough i'm going to start from this other area and do quests from here"", you are restricted to a certain path with minimal variation. Low replayability.The map gets progressively emptier as the game goes on, the first region is filled with dungeons and places to explore, while as you progress further in the game there are more and more empty areas and the last region is even 75% inaccessible.The very first story boss you encounter is one of the hardest to defeat. From there the game is downhill until the later ones.One thing to point out is that many of the bosses you encounter early in the game appear again and again as the game progresses as minor bosses. By the mid/end of the game this gets a bit repetitive.That being said, the soundtracks that play during boss fights are very good and immersive and the bosses themselves have interesting move sets and phases and need to be tackled with different approaches, good stuff.Honestly the bosses are what really keep this game afloat and made me want to come back for the challenge, still some of them are too easy/predictable.The game can be challenging if you don't overlevel, but on my first playthrough, when i tried to do everything, i didn't face any real challenge.I found it to be well refined and balanced for PvE (i don't play PvP as mentioned above). Weapons, weapon skills, spells and incantations felt unique and well designed.My only complaint here is that in the menus you don't see a preview of what weapon skills do before applying them to the weapon, there is just a (often vague) text description.It was fun to play around with different weapons, plus it was easy to reassign my stats when i wanted to change playstyle.Consistent graphics and good looking game all around. In some places you can take very stunning screenshots. Some minor imperfections, but they don't break the immersion.The game is capped at 60fps, not a fan of that, but not the end of the world. Just disappointed since it's a game that came out in 2022 and it's very easy to implement, just shows laziness.It keeps frame dropping to 10-20fps for no reason, it's not even a matter of first time loading an area, just random.There is a very clear difference in optimization between areas, and the rain is just an unnecessary feature that makes the performance even less consistent.The hitboxes in PvE are poorly executed, both the body and weapons. Sometimes bosses swing their weapons through the ground below you and still hit you, or an invisible aura around them pushes you off a ledge.There is no collision control, if an enemy swings its sword from the other side of a wall it's going to hit you, when bosses charge their attacks while near a wall sometimes you can't see them coming because they are half inside it.Some AOE boss attacks have weird hitboxes that don't match the visuals.One of the most annoying things that happened constantly was that my summons, prioritizing the closest enemy, targeted monsters outside the boss room.This way i was often left alone with the boss and had to run to the other side of the boss room and summon from there, exposing myself to attacks.The most annoying thing about mouse and keyboard controls is that the camera always moves around on its own and you have to constantly fight it with your mouse.For example if you move with your character while looking in another direction, the camera will try to follow it automatically.Another big problem is the automatic lock feature: when you are fighting bosses in the open, slightly moving your mouse will result in your character changing target to some irrelevant passive enemy.The interface is clearly designed to be used with a controller, and very awkward to use with mouse and keyboard. Unintuitive use of Q and E to select stuff, ESC is just not a thing.Sometimes there are yes/no prompts on screen mid fight and the only way to press yes is by reaching with your mouse.The keybind customization for mouse and keyboard is very limited.For example you can't use separate keys for roll and sprint, tap to roll, hold to sprint.This implies a huge input delay for rolling since the activation is on key release. Although i enjoyed it, i can't leave a positive review since it could have delivered much more. Buy, it's fun :)",0
Negative,I was level 250 with 100 hours into the game when I got invaded by a hacker and now I'm stuck in an infinite death loop. I have researched on how I can get out of it but it doesn't seem to work for some reason the most upsetting part about it is that the guy that hacked my game save files has been hacking across all souls games for 10 years and for some reason the devs aren't or can't do anything against him. So just to warn you all out there ! IF YOU INVADE/GET INVADED BY A GUY CALLED Go to brazil ALT+F4 AS FAST AS YOU CAN AND DON'T LET HIM HIT YOU! He'll cast a spell then there is a puprle glow and your game will crash. It would be a great game if not for that hacker.

Negative,"I've played all the souls games but BB (I Was on Xbox back in the day) but this game has some of the most BS-filled boss fight gimmicks in all of Souls games. You could play previous souls games as whatever build you want and get through it pretty fine but not this game. If you didn't get killed in a one-shot delayed combo then the next one will while you try to drink a heal. I'd say have fun but you'd spend most of your time sitting in a corner as the people you summon use exploit builds to down a boss in 2 minutes. (Bleed, bloodrot, sorcery). Otherwise, the best part of the game is the world, lore, and exploration. Dressing up in what looks cool (Fashionsouls) and PVP is all fantastic but the biggest thing about souls games in my opinion are the boss fights which are a total letdown when you attempt to do it without exploits.Update: This game has the worst PVP.

I can admit my hardware is bad.but hearing from friends with better computers that there is performance issues worries me about its optimization.The exploration aspect was really fun, exploring to find new items, bosses, etc.The problem is this game lacks polish and after finding the majority of the bosses to just be copy and pasted, I got bored. I beat the Elden Beast, and I felt nothing. All I can do is hope that this game gets 'better' although by what I have witnessed, I have my doubts.",0
Negative,"Only buy this game if you want to play it single player. Playing with a friend will have you invaded constantly with players who will use the cheapest tactics and builds. Of course, if you want to be a loser and look up builds on Youtube about how to annoy other players who don't want you around, by using said builds, then this game's also for you!Elden Ring needs to make dedicated PvP servers. Invasions have been very annoying and unfair. Getting Rogier's +8 weapon made the early game INCREDIBLY irritating and unfair, when it comes to invasions! I'm done.I will not ever recommend this game, until PvP is made completely, 100%, optional. I will not be playing this game's multiplayer anymore. I've never been interested in forced PvP. Helping randoms and friends, who are legitimately playing through the game, has always been my main interest. Having PvP become optional however, is very unlikely to ever happen, because of the HUGE toxic fanbase that seems to have joined what used to be a pretty good community.So once I'm done, I'm looking forward to replaying it with my friends, to just sit and troll invaders. I won't need to progress or care about enemies anymore. It'll be so nice to waste all of your times. Hell, even just hiding and avoiding invaders has been pretty funny.

Negative,"TLDR: Takes about 12 hours to get to the actual game, and 9 of those hours are just farming XPThe area you can first see on the map isnt the actual map, the actual map is literally 4 times larger. The problem is 75% of the map is blocked by a skill wall of being able to beat the first 2 bosses, which in order to have an ok time of beating you need to be around level 30. The glaring issue is the XP earned in order to level up. From level 1 it takes about 500 XP to level up which isnt too bad, to get from level 33 to 34 it takes around 10,000 XP to level up. The basic enemies give you around 60 XP per kill with the most you can get from a common enemy (mini bosses not included) is around 1000 XP. The higher end common enemies take a solid while to kill and the game becomes unfun and boring when youre forced to farm the same enemies over and over again. At around level 25 however you can comfortably take on some of the mini bosses which will grant you a solid 4000 XP on the higher end and 2000 XP on the lower end which is when we introduce problem number 2 and 3. XP is not only XP, it's also the currency in which you buys items from weapons and armor to consumables and ingredients ON TOP OF you dropping ALL of your XP on death, and if you die again without picking it up all of it is gone forever and the game is already stupidly hard as it is. When leveling up you can only level up one category per level than the overall price to level up again shoots up. Overall this game is absolutely phenomenal looking and when you kill a boss by the skin of your teeth or find an awesome weapon it feels really cool. I just cant get past this one glaring issue of how BS the XP system is, it makes the game not fun until you can finally beat the first 2 bosses. the enemies in the starting area range from downright impossible to kill to not fun to kill due to being too easy but none of them give enough XP in order to make the games first few hours other than a repetitive nightmare. Unless youre a masochist who only works 2 hours shifts every other day at applebees, you wont have fun. Poopoo game.",0

Too many of the bosses are one or two hit instant death machines with poorly telegraphed mechanics. That's not conducive to an enjoyable learning experience as you die over and over to the same thing. Even leveling up for better stats and finding better armor does not improve the situation by enough to make it enjoyable. You can spend hours grinding and still get killed within a few hits if you don't dodge in the correct direction within a fraction of a second.Unless you like spending hours and hours trying to beat a single boss, look elsewhere.",0

At least not yet - there are crippling server issues that cause consistent disconnects every 4-5 minutes, occasionally you'll be lucky enough to reach the 10 minute mark but it's not very common. So far FromSoft are either completely oblivious (despite it being an issue since release) or simply don't care with no fix anywhere in sight.Until this is fixed, I can't recommend it to anybody since online play has always been a big part of the souls games.This would be acceptable if the game was a week old or so, but it's coming up to a month now and we've heard nothing. Really glad I bought this at full price.",0

Negative,"If you want to play with another friend forget it. There is no way to stop the ""invasion"". Other high level players will come to the starting area and kill you. This should be an option to turn off. This is honestly dumb. Can't take 2 steps before someone invades and you die.",0
Negative,The game is always crashing when ever I play. Its been 8 crashes so far since I bought it on the 3rd of March. Also for some reason when the enemies are invisible sometimes. It happens mainly in dark areas. And of course the frame drops when ever your in a big open area.which is pretty much the whole game. I just say it since no one else is.this game is almost as much as a let down as Cyperpunk 2077.,0
Negative,"It's one of the best games I have ever played but honestly there is no way I will recommend this on PC the state it is in. Buy it on consoles if you can.There is massive frame rate issues, insane input lag that comes with it too. The way the controller support is programmed almost made me instantly refund it, gave me DS2 vibes where I have to literally disconnect every single game controller device I have (due to my love for sim racing I have quite a lot of stuff plugged in all the time), I also have to disable vJoy otherwise my PS4 controller doesn't work at all. What is this dude, 1980's? Even the games on my fathers commodore 64 handled multiple joysticks plugged in.If fromsoft fixes the frame rate and input lag issues then I will change this to a recommended. Unfortunately looking at their track record when it comes to stuff like this, I have a feeling this isn't going to be fixed.",0
Negative,"Poorly optimised for PC, graphical fidelity from 2016, boring story, cringy voice acting, basically Dark Souls 3 in open world. Same frame pacing issues that have persisted since that game too. Bad quest design, terrible magnetic horse back movement. Some nice new features such as summons Ashes, NPC's maps etc., to help in tough situations, however, often give you these cool additions only to take them away again in many places, which I found to be frustrating. From Software has basically been releasing the same game since Demon Souls, this time going down the ever increasing trend developers have of creating an 'open world' game. The tightness, pacing and consistent higher quality achieved in the Souls games is lost here and is an example of quantity over quality.Was left feeling that the world was largely empty with uncompelling quests (with the exception of the Ranni quest) and lore. From Software's numerous toying with the game shows that it didn't balance the game to their liking on release and additions to unevolved quest lines shows that Elden Ring was released incomplete, another bad practice common I've noticed in this AAA video game industry.One of the only good reasons for playing was meeting the iconic character Ranni the Witch.Overall doesn't come close to the tightness and higher quality of the Dark Souls series.Not Recommended.",0
Negative,"Seems like a great game, but performance issues are horrendous. I've tried all the fixes online, and none have worked. 90% of enemies are invisible, game crashes at random moments including in key cutscenes, and lag is awful at all times. I really don't like being that guy who complains about games being ""literally unplayable"", but-it is.",0
Negative,"For a multiplayer game, multiplayer doesn't work. All the disconnection issues make this game terrible. Is it soo hard to fix multiplayer? What about Mulitplayer for dark souls 1-3? Fix that yet? No? Then i guess Fuck your game. I cant even fight an invader cause they keep getting disconnected.",0
Negative,FIX white screen of death thanks. 150 hr wasted. 1.6gb updates only takes 10min right? nah you gotta redownload the whole game for the update to work. like ?,0
Negative,"I love this game but multiplayer is an absolute joke and most of the time is practically unusable due to connection errors that constantly kick you out. This is only reason for leaving a negative review, but since everyone is being a fanboy and making excuses for the developers for any criticism at all, I'll address two other issues:1. You need to let me quit to the desktop. It is asinine to make me go through the login process again when I'm done with the game. No excuses about this being mainly designed for consoles. You sold it as a PC game.2. The game needs better maps that show more than just sites of grace.I really love the game. It's my first Souls type game. The difficulty does not bother me, I just explore elsewhere, put on some music, and level up and come back to the different bosses. I would like to see a bit more in the way of story, character development and general explanation of what is going on though.When the multiplayer issues are fixed I will change this review to Recommend. When it works, multiplayer is a ton of fun. But usually the experience is: Wait 5 minutes to be summoned; Get kicked out within a few minutes by a connection error. And, since death is constant in this game (and since many people co-oping think they can be reckless because they are in a group), when it does work you are likely to have a short co-op experience anyway. I'm not complaining about the game's difficulty, I'm just saying that in a game this brutal, getting kicked out due to connection issues on top of this means multiplayer consists mostly of waiting around to get in a group that lasts a very short time and results in very little gameplay and a lot of time dicking around with summoning pools and fingers and whatnot.",0
Negative,cant play steam updates blow wiener,0
Negative,"Looks pretty, and extremely massive. Plenty to do, tons to explore. Truly an open-world RPG masterpiece. I understand why the ratings are so high - it makes sense. Either way, I don't recommend this game. Whether you're a first time player or a long time fan of the developer, at some point or another you will have to use the internet to figure out what is going on. I. -hate- that. It's maddening. The game should be immersive enough that I don't need to consult the internet for help. I can't stand the dated, unexplained user interface and attack/defense elements. Let me be clear - I'm sure you can invest a lot of time into this game and learn everything by trial and error. Cool - I don't think that's an attractive element, and I hate it. Explain things. Give me some sort of manual or user guide. ""The most accessible souls game"" is the biggest load of crap I've ever heard, and I constantly hear it from dated souls-like game players. Every person's first souls-like game is still their first and the learning curve is insanely massive. No matter how much YouTube videos I seemingly have to watch, no matter how much advice I get, I am not at ALL excited or anxious to progress in this game. I'm far more annoyed that I never know what's going on. The final nail in the coffin is the community. God forbid you ask for help and get lampooned with ""git gud"" or ""give up cry more"" etc etc comments. The messaging system in game isn't funny after the same message 6984756 times. The game is not accessible. It's hard, and that's OKAY. But it's not accessible. Just., stop with that garbage. This game is hard, but my gripe is not with the combat difficulty. It's literally everything else, enough to make me really not care for this game like I wanted to.",0
Negative,Designed for consoles.Ie the control scheme for PC is stupid and does not work properlyenemies attack clipping through solid objects.some enemies will appear out of no where.enemies do not respect stance when attackedSome enemies will attack without spawningevery single enemy has attacks 4 times faster than you can do yourself,0
Negative,"Having clocked 30+ hours of gameplay, up until this point I would have described the performance as tolerable. Crashes have been occasional (approx. every 2-3 hours of gameplay), only occurring during exploration of the open world, and never at a critical moment. However, I have now reached a stage where the game crashes every time without fail on a particular boss. It is extremely frustrating.This is a sub-standard console-to-PC port with some glaring flaws emerging. As much as I want to, I cannot recommend this game for PC until some serious improvements are made.AMD RX Vega 56 (Attempted multiple driver iterations, no change to stability)Intel i5 4690k OC'd to 4.5 GHz16GB RAMInstalled on SSD",0
Negative,"PC port: HorribleArt Direction: Best one yetCombat: Fights no longer feel like fights as they did in previous games, the fluidity is gone, now everything has a very identifiable attack pattern. Fighting the majority of the bosses feels like a chore, especially when they're literally just reskins or doubles. Oh yeah tree sentinel? Let's put two of them here.Combat against large groups of enemies especially feels tedious, the game practically forces you to cheese your way out of them with weapon arts, jumping attacks and using your horse. All of these new mechanics which are supposed to be added features have now become a necessity in dealing with the BS with combat unless you want to spend three times as much time dealing with them by playing super carefully and reactively, it doesn't feel intuitive, like a fight, just feels like fighting AI which is designed to be annoying rather than difficult.Out of all of the souls games I've played, this has been the only one where I actually didn't feel guilty for cheesing enemies and bosses.PvP: I haven't played much of it but as far as I can see the meta is like so that spamming spells and weapon arts is the way to go. When playing against close friends who weren't using any weapon arts at all I had the most fun in souls pvp ever, feels like a genuine competition.",0
Negative,The game was working fine and ran smoothly on my machine prior to 1.03 update. Unfortunately the game now lags consistently and constant stutter regardless of quality level and at this point the game is unplayable. I wish I could return the game.

Negative,"Invisible enemies still hasn't been patched. A fan release fixed the issue and improved performance on my machine. Then the new official patch broke the fan fix. Now I'm back to trying to fight invisible enemies. It sucks because I really still enjoy the open world discovery aspect of this game. This isn't my first Souls game so my instincts have allowed me to progress somewhat, but having the fan patch and then being forced to go back broke my spirit a bit. For the short time where I was able to enjoy this game in it's fullest form, I had an absolute blast! I'll be back someday, but who knows when that'll be.",0
Negative,"While many parts of the game are very enjoyable, a major issue makes it frustrating beyond belief, many enemies will be invisible, this makes traveling through the open world frustrating when you ride your horse down a seemingly empty road only to find yourself surrounded by a dozen enemies or in a boss fight and it summons backup who you clan't see so get hit from no where due to being unable to dodge or hit attacks you can't see coming. For a game that is about timing this is an unacceptable bug, i wouldn't post this review but I've been waiting for them to fix it and after two updates its still here. I will remove this review when they fix this bug but I'd hold off for playing to avoid the frustration until they fix it.",0
Negative,"As a huge fan of all souls games to this date i must say that Elden Ring didnt quite fit my expectations.-Fights are either too easy or ridiculously hard in a non entertaining way. (like Godskin Duo) unless you use mimic tear ash or some stupid spirit summon.-PVP is a huge stepdown in my opinion. With the no active poise , weapons like Claymore and other greatswords in general are prety much useless in PVP. Worst netcode i've seen in a soulsgame so far. -The concept of open world in a souls game is the absolute worst idea. Even tho it sounded interesting and appealing at first , the way they implemented it is just boring.I want it to be clear that its not a bad game. It just was not what i expected as a souls fan. Hope there wont be an open world dark souls game if they're planning to make one.",0

Negative,"I would recommend this game to a lot of people, but not at the moment, it's a great game, don't get me wrong, but there is just too many issues with the game right now. The framerate is not consistent at all, you'll go from having 60 FPS to 30 depending on the area, and the multiplier don't get me started on that. There is just so many connection issues, I can't even connect sometimes, or see my friends summon signs.All in all, this is a beautiful game, From Software has really outdone themselves with this title. My review will change from a no to a yes when they fix some of the bugs.",0
Negative,"Quite possibly the worst game I've played in 25 years or RPG's.

Negative,"Why do they have to make this game so difficult? I have been playing for about 50 hours now and I can't even kill they most basic of enemies, They keep coming at you even though you hit them pretty hard, but that doesn't matter because they will keep hitting you until you die. Instead of making this game enjoyable, they made it as impossible as they could. I know a lot of people will say ""welcome to dark souls"" but why? Why make this make to hard that it's just borderline impossible to go through without putting in hundreds of hours?",0
Negative,"They didn't do any kind of balancing, nearly all spells are extremely underwhelming, some weapon arts are super broken and some weapons just don't work. On top of that, they made two super bad decisions, first they introduced flying enemies, which will make you rage quit at least a couple of times and second they decided it'd be a great idea to make bosses not challenging but unfair, they increased the rng and reduced rhythmical timings like in the other souls games, so its harder to ""learn"" the bosses.",0
Negative,"(tldr; multiplayer sucks and this game really could be 10/10 but it's not because of it and a few other important reasons)*IF YOU WANT TO PLAY THIS WHOLE GAME WITH A FRIEND, THIS REVIEW IS SPECIFICALLY FOR YOU! SINGLE PLAYER PERFECTION (bar performance issues)OK for everyone else if you're thinking about buying and playing this game single-player only then do it. If you like a challenge this will be one of the best games you've ever played, no doubt. Enemies/bosses are varied and complex, the world is absolutely drenched in atmosphere and unspoken lore like all souls games. Weapons, build diversity and level design are killer.Some enemies seem impossible at first, but you learn, adapt and can prep in many ways to give yourself the edge. Most enemies have weaknesses (think certain weapon and damage types like strike vs slash and holy vs fire), it's all there for you to take advantage of. If you wanna grind a bunch and become super OP and decimate bosses you can do that too, if that's how you have fun then do it. Learning enemy patterns and beating them at a recommended level gives me the most satisfaction but really, whatever brings you joy.*BUT (for those interested primarily in jolly cooperation)Here's where it gets rough I'm afraid, and it truly pains me to feel I have to write all this negative stuff. I do get heated and angry because I'm passionate about this franchise I've unfortunately developed a true love/hate relationship with. I've played most of the Souls games on various platforms, DS1 & DS3 are among my favourites of all time. I've enjoyed the multiplayer in each one but loathed it simultaneously. Currently, Elden Ring is a complete joke when it comes to cooperative play, given how many games FromSoftware have now produced. I have never been so inspired to write a critical review like this and that is a genuine shame. CONNECTION ISSUESThere are constant disconnects between friendly summons and invaders and you can tell it's not just McDonald's WiFi, it's something Bandai/FS related. My brother and I (with gigabit internet) get kicked at least 10 times an hour for no reason, and having 2 friendly summons with you? Forget about it, ""A connection error occurred, returning to your world"", ""Unable to summon cooperator"", man I never had a single issue like this with Nioh and that even did joint story progression perfectly to boot. NO JOINT STORY PROGRESSIONOn that topic, there is no joint story progression. You have to do literally everything twice, as soon as you've done it once, to keep up with your friend who's trying to play the whole game with you. You might think this is fine; I don't. It's ridiculous now and it was ridiculous in DS1 thru DS3. All I can say is Nioh did it 5 years ago so now I know it can be done, so do it. NO SEAMLESS JOINT EXPLORATIONRegarding caves/dungeons/catacombs; if you're in the open world and you find one with a friend STOP fog wall. You now have to kick your mate, enter the cave, hit the grace (bonfire) and travel back to where you INITIALLY summoned them in the open world. Then travel all the way back to said cave, get kicked yourself, then re-summon at the grace in the cave. THEN you can do the cave together. Same routine to get back out. I'm sorry, but fuck off, I can't believe how bad this is for such a big game. Put a loading screen there to pass the fog wall together in multiplayer and keep it open in single player or something, anything. This is deer with brainrot levels of dumb. NEUTERED TRAVELLING ONLINEPlease, please let co-op summons travel on horseback together. It takes a fucking horrendously long time to explore new regions together, fully, on foot. I don't want to rush through the areas, I want to check out every nook and cranny because sometimes I find something really cool and interesting! Having to walk EVERYWHERE is absolutely mind-numbing. Infinite stamina to sprint outside of combat doesn't come close to remedying this. I can't understand why this isn't allowed, just kick us off the horse when invaded to prevent cheesing reds if that's the concern, I'm 100% fine with that.Seriously, From, how dare you tout this huge open world that lives up to everything you said it would, and then cripple my experience by disabling the major travel utility during co-op. Now I can't climb what were previously easily surmountable ledges or use Spirit Springs. What the actual fuck. CO-OP IS STILL BEHIND AN ITEM WALLYou still have to craft or earn an in-game item to play together. I'm ~100hrs in now and I obviously have more than enough furlcalling finger bullshit to last me the rest of the story, but initially, I was pissed I had to run around foraging just to play with a friend. Why? How does this elevate my experience? How is this anything BUT a negative? There's always been this bizarre ritual that must be performed just to play online and frankly it's not outdated, it's just stupid and always has been. Just because you're used to it doesn't make it OK, and personally I'm fed up with these unnecessary steps to reach a normal feature of the game. REGION RESTRICTED CO-OP, POST-SOME (?) BOSSESWhy the FUCK can't I summon my friends in seemingly all of Limgrave when Godrick and other bosses are still alive? Even if they're all dead, why is there yet ANOTHER restriction here? I wanna slay the dragons, the bell bearing hunters, the deathbirds and the night's cavalry with my boys? And also just explore the rest of the area and camps with them? Now I HAVE to do this shit solo. Why is it that if some currently unknown combination of region bosses are slain that an enormous chunk of the map is now completely dead for co-op until NG+? It was fucking annoying to have to stop progressing at Pontiff's in DS3 just to keep fight clubs alive and bustling. Why is this shit still here?Maybe one day they'll understand that lots of people won't hit game early achievements, not because it's hard, but because it's fucking annoying to use basic stuff like multiplayer. Not co-op related, but: LIMITED RESPECCINGWHY is this finite again? It takes fucking ages to get a new character up Lv150 or w/e Duelist meta ends up being. Why let us do it ~15 times, and not just unlimited? I don't care if I have to farm larval tears at crazy low drop rates, just please stop forcing me to play the whole game again to make a new build because I ran out of tears and fancy a change. If you try to honestly mod or cheat to help with this you will just get fucking banned forever. Those of us who min/max builds a lot will get sick of this real fast. If it wasn't for DS3's infinite respec glitch that game would've been dead to me long, long ago. SUMMONING POOLS & INVASION TOOLS POORLY IMPLEMENTED, AGAINWhy do I have to activate summoning pools by interacting with this thing that doesn't visually indicate it? I should just be able to turn on/off specific pools on the map. And why the fuck aren't the invasion tools like the Wex Dust mod in DS3, come ON, the work was already done for you.I am sick and tired of how a now well-funded, highly experienced team like this keeps pushing out these awkward as shit 'co-op' experiences with bad key features. Don't get me wrong, the game is otherwise GOTY and I'm truly in awe of the size and grandeur of the world. But travelling the Lands Between with friends is paramount to many fully enjoying the game and right now it's just so frustrating to do that nearly all of the time. I will email all this directly to Bandai, DM me if there's anything else worth suggesting because just seething about it at home won't help, they gotta hear about it somehow. I have more to say, I've run out of space on this review. The game runs like shit on my 1060 6gb all low settings, fix that too.7/10Fuck you",0
Negative,"Still need a lot of polishing this game. When you hit enemy with strong attack from behind, they fall to the ground. Next attack or two will completely miss enemy as if it's not there at all. When enemy knocks you down, till your character stands up it takes literally ages and you stand up just to die especially facing bosses. Also next thing what I can not understand. Having early in the game opponents that have 2m long swords against you with 1m long axe. Also these enemies can attack quiet fast and defending their blows costs you half of your stamina, so. I don't get it at all as to why so facing them is a challenge, but facing giants or big bosses with swords and axes that are 30m long, like it wouldn't be enough that you have to 5x roll away from them to get at least some distance, which eventually comes with price of taking half of your stamina, but it is still useless as they just attack and your stamina with your health will disappear faster then you can say ""f*ck sake"" and good luck attacking them without stamina.The biggest disappointment for me after such unbalanced fighting is the camera. It is constantly forcing the camera to look forward or ahead of you even if you slow camera down to ""0"" and disable centering and such unless you lock on target, but free roaming camera is so awful. Why is it not possible to just disable completely and you can be looking whichever direction you want while free roaming.So at the moment I can not recommend this game at all.",0

Negative,"A boring frustrating pointless experience. The open world is 100% useless only made as a trekking simulator ti artificially inject hours of fake gameplay for you to ride around. The quests are just basically a convuleted mess, with no hints in the game and no journal. You will pass most of your time on external sites just to understand where to go. Overpowered items all over the place, with no real connection to the game. Boss fights are 100% boring crap. All the bosses mostly have the same whirling and circular attacks. The fire Giant boss is the wors ever encounter i had in my whole gaming experience. (not joking) You will find yourself 90% of the time just passing by all the open world as there is absolutely no point in even fighting there. you can easily get 1-shotted from mobs but not from bosses ? Like the game had 2 different devs, 1 for the open world and the other for all the rest. Nothing is good in here, save your money for a better game. Not to mention that you will fight more the camera and the controls than the actual game, and on mouse+keyboard the game is simply unplayable in the final part, as you will not be able to perform combos and action consistently. Not to mention that the game sometime just forgets to register your keys, and acts weirldy buffering commands you never inputted. SAVE YOURSELF AND YOUR MONEY FROM THIS!",0

Negative,"It is impossible to recommend a game with this large a budget where they vehemently refuse to make tooltips for PC controls if you arent using a controllerLiterally an intern could do that in a few hours work, I don't care if it doesn't adapt to your own customized keybindings, I shouldn't have to google the fact that you have to press Q to go back in settings (as opposed to escape) or as the first people did, smash your face against the keyboard until you get the right key.EDIT: My friends discovered this is possible to change with a setting (only had to suffer my first 20 hours), why it doesn't just detect when you haven't connected a controller I do not know. But for anyone who reads this and decides to play anyway look for and change that right away.",0
Negative,"After spending 118 hours playing this game, I can fairly say that this game is not worth it in the long run. From my experience, most bosses are unique and cool while others are not as they are too similar to other bosses from previous souls games. Not only that, some bosses that you fought before became common enemies or reused in certain areas of the game which kinda loses their uniqueness, becoming both annoying and boring as hell. On another topic, most of the NPCs in this game are robotic as hell as they don't say much to you in terms of liking their character or even being interested in their backstory. This game was fun for the first 48 hours, but you later realize this game reused a lot of content and bosses to which you feel unmotivated to even finish the game (to which I had to push myself to finish it because I don't like to leave games unfinished). If you really wanna try Elden Ring, then please wait for a sale so you don't regret buying this game at full price (or don't, it's your choice).",0
Negative,"The optimisation of this game for PC is very poor with frequent frame rate dips and missing textures. The early game feels fine and interesting how much there is to explore. The mid game is very interesting and fun once you get your build online and start fighting some of the more interesting bosses. After a certain point though, it becomes absolutely horrendous, bosses with way to high of HP pools, constant one shot attacks, insane tracking on enemy AI, and reusing bosses to the point of it being insufferable. Every complaint I've ever heard about Dark Souls 2 can be made about this game, some even more so and yet this game is being praised like it's the best thing ever. It's not, it's just okay and probably the worst game in the franchise. 6/10",0

Negative,"I just tried Burger King's new menu item, ""The Whopper Melt"" and I must say it left MUCH to be desired. For starters, there are NO buns, just two pieces of BREAD? I did not ask for a sandwich. You come to burger king to get just that. A BURGER for Christ's sake. My wife and I each purchased a large whopper melt meal with Mello Yellow to drink. 13.49 for a sandwich and a meager amount of fries (Which is another issue entirely for another review. Sidenote, Mary-Beth's onion rings came out alright) This price is ridiculous, you shouldnt have to break the bank for Burger King. Now the meat itself was fine, it had that great flame-broiled taste you come to love from Burger King. But that sauce? Goodness was it spicy. and NOT in a good way! Mary-Beth could barely finish hers the sauce was so hot. And it was slathered on there! I wanna taste the meat too Mr. King. Anyways, once you get past the sauce then you get into the issue of the onions. Never enough in my humble opinion. I'm an onion maniac! In fact I took a few swings at growing my own in the side garden a few years back. They didn't take however, this New Hampshire soil is far too rocky and harsh. But I digress, don't skimp on the onions! The cheese was cheese, no issues there (Sidenote: It was in fact very gooey and melty) Lastly the sourdough bread. Where do I begin? For starters they've toasted it ENTIRELY too much. I don't like my buns to be too crunchy, as the crumbs tend to get stuck in my teeth! The taste was awful! I've never been a fan of sourdough personally, and my mother always said it's called ""Sour"" dough for a reason! All in all, I must say that the whopper melt leaves me disappointed. I was hoping for a better meal for my 14 dollars. My final rating? 5/10 :( Edit: Thanks for the gold kind strangers! I was talking with my wife's boytoy and I realized that the whopper melt is in fact high mid, and not the low low pack as I had previously stated. And so I change my score from 5/10 to 6/10, high mid :)",0
Negative,"Game is simply too big and it has diluted the quality of everything found within, most bosses also left me with a sour aftertaste instead of the feeling of accomplishment you used to get, mostly due to how unfun they've become if not unfair.",0
Negative,"Game stopped loading properly and enemies are invisible, even torrent is invisible! very frustraiting to reload an area only for a few to be fixed. its a beautiful world with alot of danger but im sorry this unplayability part means that this game is not yet ready, enjoy on your console i dont think ill be playing a souls game like this anytime soon, was my first souls game and its ruined.",0
Negative,"Edit: I launched my game yesterday and it says my character is corrupted. Contacted support and got a copy paste not our problem, sucks to be you reply. Tried Steam backup, but somehow that's also corrupted.6/10This game is a solid 8.5/10. Not ""the best game ever made"" like people are saying. It's huge Souls game. If you don't like Dark Souls, you probably won't like this.Think Dark Souls meets BotW kind of.",0
Negative,"Overall excellent game, maybe a bit too big for its own good, they got very lazy populating their world sometimes, reutilizing bosses left and right which felt cheap. Probably the best boss fights out of all FromSoftware games. Boss music was great, open world music not so much (Caelid soundtrack on a loop with no breaks when you're spending hours in the zone will make you mad).I would recommend the game, but can't do it because of the performance issues. I know the standards are low in gaming nowadays but the PC version of this game is a joke, frame issues and crashes even with good hardware. Expected better from them, especially after the amazing release of Sekiro.",0
Negative,"This is a terrible game for PC and co-op play and is basically an afterthought, very cobbled together. It was created and targeted to the console. Cant remap keys, several movement types are simply not available to PC users. NO explanation AT ALL for any of the changes. Tutorial still shows controller keys and not pc mapped which made it useless. Co-op/Multiplayer is a complete joke. You can only stay in one area and you must go to everyone's private world and beat the same boss over and over for each player to get credit for it. If you want to go to another area you have to log out have one person go into that area then have them summon everyone to the new area, which you are all now locked into AGAIN. Sad because we really wanted to explore the world together, be frightened together and experience the awww of the world together.",0

Negative,"Sadly i too experience the white screen crash issue, which really sucks cuzi was hoping to finally be able to experience a souls game for the first time and be able to play it with everyone else, there are options out there to install files to try to fix it but that disables u from playing it online which i feel is a big part of the game, ill change my review if this is ever fixed",0
Negative,"First the positive:- the first few starting areas were amazing and densely packed with interesting things to find and locations- combat is good if you dont go for pure incantations (equivalent of miracles in dark souls)- new summoning system is fun (the bells, not the jesus figures you have to manually activate)- some good looking armor and fun weapons- dungeon designs are pretty cool (for the first time, not repeat dungeon no. 3/4/5)the bad:- You are a Dark souls character (slow & tactical) in a post BB/Sekiro world (high speed and aggressive enemies)- difficulty spikes in the later third of the game is ridiculous- incantations are shit and finding the right ones when every spell only exists once in the gigantic open world feels like bad design- music is unfortunately rather forgettable- as are the ""boss"" fights that are undertuned- doing quest lines without google is futile- the later half of the game has the problem most open worlds have. It's empty and could have done with half the size.- horse fighting sucks, as does riding for 25min with nothing interesting happening- in 110h i had about 40 crashes and lots and lots of slow downs, fps drops and many occurences of the invisible-enemies bug",0
Negative,"This is NOT the game of the year like so many people have hyped it up to be. After 55 hours of playing Elden Ring I am finding myself quite disappointed with it. I am not new to these kinds of games, I've been playing RPG, MMORPG, etc for many years. Elden Ring intrigued me because of it's open world exploration and mystery of the story. I am level 68 right now and still using the same armor I started the game with, I have found armors in the mid-level zones and they are inferior. It feels like there is no progression for my character. The spells I am casting are the same as when I started because it's the best spell for FP efficiency and damage, meanwhile I have collected at least 15 Glintstone spells that are worthless in comparison. I am spending more time grinding the same mobs for runes to level up than I am exploring because these particular mobs drop more runes than any others, and because of that it's really dragging the game down and it feels like a slog. So much for exploration and intrigue. I'm not sure it's worth putting anymore of my time into.",0
Negative,"The game plays like a 2nd rate MMO. It's a chore grindfest to level up. And, I remember NPC's in World of Warcraft having more personality than the ones in this game; that's how bad they are. There isn't any real driving story either. You just sort of wander around aimlessly in this bizarre nightmare world killing the freakish inhabitants. Which could be okay, but it's not like the combat is anything exceptional. You don't hack off body parts or do cool finishing moves. The enemies just fall over and that's that. It's really just ""blah."" Seriously, it might as well be a free to play MMO.I don't get the overwhelmingly positive reviews. The game is below average. There isn't any new game mechanics that you haven't already seen since the old Playstation 2 days. The only thing going for it is the difficulty level (which is just right) and the LSD induced strangeness of everything.I can't find a reason to keep playing. I just don't care about the world and I've got no interest in slaughtering the same grindy trash mobs over and over in order to get points to level up. Maybe if the game was only $20 I'd give it a positive review, because this doesn't feel like a AAA title.",0

Negative,shitt easy game,0
Negative,"If the below problems are fixed I can see this being one of the best titles available for A-RPG's on PC but in it's current state i would recommend against paying full price for numerous reasons below.The boss fight's while majorly fun and interesting are riddled with attacks which are either full of lingering hitboxes which means learning how to avoid them is pure trial and error since the visuals are not accurate or have openings so massive that once you realise them it trivializes the fight depriving it of any challenge.The online's not even a month old and already has hackers even with the inclusion of an intrusive anti-cheat. If you're fortunate enough to manage to avoid meeting such hackers the vast majority of online currently ends with abrupt ""connection to host lost"" messages as DC's happen the majority of the time.Due to the games matchmaking using Epic Online Services instead of steam works the recent players list does not work for this game, So you can't add people who you enjoyed playing online with and build up a group of friends with this game. Either you already know people who play this game or have to rely on third party services to find people to play with.The current balancing of weapons and playstyles is poor at best as certain attributes perform massively better then others so if your unfortunate enough to like a playstyle that under performs then your in for a much harder time then someone who was fortunate enough to pick one of the more optimal playstyles.Once the game has received a few balance patches and tweaks to the online then the game is easily worth the price as it's full of interesting concepts and idea's but until problems above are resolved then your wish list is the best place for it until at least a 50% sale.",0
Negative,this game is so bad i cant even kill someone lvl 1 with a club. i cant even keep my maiden,0
Negative,"So my bf and I bought this game to play together and try out. I ended up getting really frustrated two times that made me wish I could return this game but sadly I hit 3 hrs so I can't anymore and I really wish I could. Anyway, the first time I got really frustrated was in creator creation I was making a girl character and for an hour. No matter what I did my character looked like a guy, i was getting so pissed off about it too because I kept double-checking did I pick the girl body? yes. okay, why the fuck does she look like a straight dude then? one thing i did like was that i could have two different colored eyes. but character creation is something i really enjoy in games and it was overly complicated to the point i was actually irritated i couldn't make my character look more feminine. make the eyes bigger sure why the fuck is it making the nose bigger too? anyway, so i didn't like that. so I started the game and everything was fine I did think f for jump was really weird. went to go play co-op with my bf because that's the whole reason we got the game was to find something we could play together. everything was fine untill we got invaded and got destroyed because ya know only 3hrs in the game atm. thought oh okay if it's a rare thing then it's okay. no it kept happening. looked for a way to turn it off so my bf and I can play and have fun and we found out that we cant. we didnt even have enough time to clear out one stupid camp together before someone would invade and kill us. that was it for me. I did read some people say it's to help ""balance"" co-op. yeah getting merked as low levels sounds really balanced. it looks like a great game but story-wise I'm confused? like who am I wtf is a maiden? why are you acting like I should know all of this already wtf is going on? does this review sound harsh maybe but this is my experience as someone who has never played dark souls and was expecting to fight hard bosses but instead I got my ass merked by unwelcomed co-op pvpers.",0
Negative,"A Dark Souls 2-2 with great narration but enlarged variety of lazy (and unbalanced) boss/enemy designs including those duplicated/copy-paste bosses likes a unity prefab duplication showcase.Open world made some fun, but most of time the exploration are only irrigation on gain something (that may even not useful) that you may easily find on your path in main dungeons in the recent souls games,but now placed in somewhere after some lazy-designed boss just waste more time.Unbalanced boss fights and enemy designs are not as interesting as recent souls games (DKS 1,3, sekiro, bloodborne), more like DKS 2 that is just spawn more and more lazy-designed bosses in a room. In elden ring, death is not meaningful like Miyazaki said as said in recent souls games, this time from software itself mess up between ""reasonable and challenge-able difficulty"" and ""just fun to watch you're dead"". Too many frustrating battles due to duplicating same enemy boss to 2 or 3, same enemy with buffed parameter, clouding enemies in a tiny space.etc.Frequency of attacks(enemies and bosses don't have a stamina or mechanism to stop spawning attacks but player have limited stamina to dodge or guard), coverage of attacks, amounts of enemies(and their attacks) makes Elden ring is more like an RPG with some action taste(without balanced design), rather than a fair action design with RPG elements; Which is fine if it's as balanced at least as Dark Souls 3, but it's just not.For me the worst about inputs is that since dev's got too greedy to put everything from SEKIRO(orst about inputs is that since dev's got too greedy to put everything from SEKIRO (jump) and DKS, run and dodge uses the same button, thus dodge will start UNTIL YOU LEAVE THE BUTTON, gave me a very ""sticky"" feeling. May be personal but when fighting hard bosses or ran into a critical situation, I will hold button more stronger subconsciously,which delay the leaving timing also the exact dodge timing. In SEKIRO there is always a step before run, so didn't have this issue; but in Elden Ring they made this decision (may due to too tiny standing /running jump spaces based level design), which is very uncomfortable to me during fighting those bosses in end game with much tight timing attacks(or it's just they are spawning too many attack colliders that covers too many frames).Inputs such as changing weapons or/and spells are as the same as DKS series, both in a bad and good way. The good: the same as before, the bad: the same un-responsible and confusing that when it's change-able when it's not. Things like UI/UX is also as bad as before: can not sort your spells/items you need un-equip all of them and re-equip all of them just to change the order. It's 2022, not 2008, still not improved.And there's also overpowered/unbalanced war of ash/weapon skills that: spawn the same skill that sorcery do but less FP cost and same damage;or has massive range and damage and very low cost.It's not challenge fights, it's just a race to find something: a race that tests who can push the destroy button first (if you found it). From Software just lose my credit on doing balanced and challenging battle. (edit: in 1.03 some of the buttons for player got nerfed so now it may be more like: they CAN be overpowered but YOU CAN'T.)To be honest, open world designs has made new player to the series more comfortable; since if a boss is hard to beat for them, they can still find something to do, to enhance character's LV or hunt more treasures, to become more stronger to fight the boss. Thanks to GRRM, story, characters, narration and world are more clear and deep enough to be explored/explained. Art designs are great.It's more like a ""WHAT are you/we expected from From Software?"" question.As a fan starts from bloodborne, experienced most of souls series (only demon souls not included in), also experienced some soul-likes games, commented so many design/balancing based on recent souls, its very hard to tell to recommend or not to recommend this game.But as ""the most anticipated game"", and as a fan that believed in From Software's quality on game balancing which did good jobs on their previous games, I decided to leave a ""No"" rather than a ""Yes""; keeping away from talk about the Cons won't push them getting better, and also not fair to other game developers. Not that bad; but also not THAT good. 10/10 is exactly overhyped, if you're not noticed it's a From Software(or Miyazaki) game, you probably won't give it 10/10 and saying ""oh a REAL souls-like game must be."" things at the same time. SEKIRO *added some comment(Cons) about input and UX.",0
Negative,just when i thought i finally made it that shitty double fight right after that comes the next awesome! Class! Really great! Great! Fine! Terrific! Impressive!,0
Negative,"I love the Souls series and the games it spawned, and while I initially loved this game I just grew tired of it before I even reached lategame. The main selling point of the game, the open world, is just not fun to traverse or explore. I much prefer the mostly linear areas of the older games that rewarded you for exploring and clearing challenging optional encounters with secret areas and cool treasures. Here I just wander the open world until I find a copy pasted dungeon that ends with the one of the countless repeated bosses and very likely rewards me with something I dont even use like a summon or upgrade material for said summon. This is especially sad since there are actually areas in the game that follow the old level design, but they are just small drops of color in the bland open world.",0
Negative,"I love this game, and I'll continue to play it for many hours after review. However, the Multiplayer in this game is the worst I've experienced and everybody who bought this game under the premise of being able to play with their friends, should be pissed. If you're NOT upset because ""it's always been like that"", you should really take a long hard look at why brand loyalty is a tool used against consumers, and not a benefit to ""fans.""Current Problems with Multiplayer:- You must grind resources in order to keep summoning your friend. - Every time you complete a task, your friend will be removed from the game until you summon for next activitiy.- Massive De-sync issues breaking boss fights. (Rennala's Barrier, Valiant Gargoyles stuck on a cliff) - I've experienced one fight persistently kicking my summoned friend before the fight is over. (Fallingstar Beast, Sellia Crystal Tunnels.)If the game would allow you to summon your friend's Mimic Tears, that would be a better coop experience than the game currently offers. This is my first real playthrough of a FromSoft game. It'll be my last if they don't make changes going forward.",0
Negative,"As a long time souls player I'm really disappointed.It's probably the best in the series. Everything looks amazing, bosses, regular enemies, locations, and the atmosphere is brilliant.Sadly this is pretty much Elden Ring's only forte.The world's structure is great, you can go anywhere and find something to do, new weapons, spells, armors, quests, materials and so on, too bad a lot of them are horrible and upgrading them requires a lot of resources for which you really have to go out of your way only to be disappointed by how poorly a lot of them perform despite their cool looks and gimmicks. A few elements of it will get a bit repetitive and I'm emphasising on caves, mines and graves her especially later on it becomes pretty repetitive.Here is where the game falls apart really bad. The game heavily relies on input reading. (Input reading is enemies responding to your button presses, not to what actually happens ingame)A lot of enemies will dodge spells, bow shots and even regular sword swings you press attack, making you virtually unable to hit some spells on a lot of enemies, charge cast a spell and they will dodge the start up of a charged attack, not when you are releasing the spell (Which I'm pretty sure you can understand why it's bad). This doesn't stop here however. Bosses will instantly punish players for attacking or healing no matter how many times they attacked before. (It's pretty much a coin flip if the boss will start another chain of attacks the second you heal or attack them once), and speaking of which bosses can be roughly split into two categories:- Giant Creature (Large AoE attacks, Heavy slams, will usually flee to the other side of the arena after some attacks, especially Dragons)- Fast Attacking Humanoids (Unlimited stamina, will do incredibly long attack chains with no opportunity to heal or attack, and as I previously stated might do another one after finally stopping if they feel like it, It's really dull having to dodge 5+ attacks to get a few hits in)And of course there are repeating bosses and duo bosses especially in dungeons, so much for variety in the later half of the game.Lastly multiplayer. There are a lot of connection issues plaguing the multiplayer component of the game. It might randomly disconnect you fairly often. Coop is well coop so not much to say here other than it's fun to enjoy some jolly cooperation. [h4]PvP[/h4]It is by far the worst in the series. First off invaders can only invade groups of 2+ players (or solo players using the taunter's tongue) and for the most part you will be fighting at least 2 players. You will usually get into groups that will stun lock you to death.Even on a one on one fight the fights are incredibly bad very dodge spam intensive with little or no room to punish spam it's really poorly balanced and you also the mage which will spam spells while running away from you.It is simply unenjoyable.Also the Arena they added is all you need to experience to realize how fundamentally broken the pvp is.Elden Ring might have a great world filled with awesome weapons, armors and spells, but it's core gameplay loop falls short, with poorly designed boss fights and cheap artificial difficulty which in the end makes me unable to recommend the game.

Negative,"The bad outweighs the good in the current state of the game and if I weren't playing dungeons with friends this would have been a refund. Get a key or wait til it goes on sale as there's no way to justify paying a AAA price tag for an A game.Mechanics are clunky and it seems like little from the core was improved from previous installments. Targeting constantly drops and makes you re-target due to environmental objects in your line of sight.""Multiplayer"" makes you wonder if you're in 2005 and is needlessly complicated with summoning reagents and either broken or hidden logic as to why one player can't summon another. Disconnects are frequent and makes it quite often unplayable.Translations are laughable in English.In game ""Message"" system litters the world with garbage where 99% of the messages are not worth even clicking. Another idea that may have sounded good on paper but fails in practice.Attributes and mechanics are hardly explained and the ""tooltips"" contain lots of words which essentially say nothing when you finish reading them.This game fits a need due to the lack of games currently on the market, which is one of the reason it's gotten so much attention. Constantly hear the claim that the game should be ""difficult"", but it's just poorly designed and clunky. Causing frustration for the player does not equate to ""difficulty"".",0

Negative,"If you don't want to read my broken english and non-making sense wiriting - i agree 100% with this video here - An amazing disappointment.It's really hard for me to articulate my thoughts about this game, because it's really good game tanked by few things that could be fixed, should have never been put into the game. Let's start with the good things.-The world is amazing, despite having a lot of reused asset it feels good, i would even argue it should've been smaller. -Amount of weapons, armor and items in the game is great, ashes, summons (Although i didn't use them for the majority of the game) etc.-Atmosphere feels great, even if it's far from bloodborne.-**Early** Stages of the game are amazing, you keep breathing in the amazingness of the world, the vast lands, interesting places.-Story, as always in Fromsoft games, the story and how it's told is cool.-Secrets, i love secrets in Fromsoft games no matter how unintuitive they are.But now to the bad things.-Worst thing about this game is it's endgame balancing, my character with close to 50 vigor, with full armor on, keeps getting almost two shoted by normal enemies that usually chain the attacks with you having close to zero chance of fighting back if you get hit because of terrible stagger mechanics in this game. -The stagger mechanic is so bad it needs to be mentioned right after, why does my character and horse stagger for ages because of a small AoE effect that deals close to zero damage. Just why.-Reused bosses or bosses with trash mobs, pretty self-explanatory. Nothing more disappointing than running the next dungeon filled with jade goblins or skeletons just to fight the same boss again with added annoyance and after that beeing rewarded with yet another useless summon.-Bosses in general are bad and forgettable, unless they are amazingly bad. I finished the game and made a lot of side content. The amount of bosses I enjoyed can be counted on the fingers of a person who lost half of a one hand and to be honest i can't even point them out because i already forgot them because of all the other unfun, unchallenging, annoying crap that i had to go through. 2nd Phase of most bosses is. the same thing with a lot of AoE attacks. -Netcode is terrible as per Fromsoft game. Nothing new here.-The enemies still attack through solid walls (also fog walls), a thing that has been here since Dark Souls 1 and is annoying. I won't even moan how many times Maliketh killed me through solid pillar Performance on PC is literally UNACCEPTABLE. It felt 5 times better to play bloodborne on the worse version of PS4 than play Elden RIng on Ryzen 7 3800x, 6600XT, DDR4 3600CL14 Ram and game on NVME disc.The game needs major rebalance patch, especially the endgame, one dog bite should not deal 1/3rd of your 50 vit full armored character's HP (and then get chained 2 times so you are dead). Some things are unfixable, like reuse and bad boss design, why at the ending part of the game we get gank boss that is made up of a bosses we already faced? Godskin Duo is really, really stupid thing to put, it feels like an afterthought along the lines ""We need something there, let's put them there because we don't want to design an interesting boss"". An interesting Gimmick Boss would be milion times better than what we got served. Bosses in Elden Ring must be the worst out of any Fromsoft games. In previous games Fromsoft carefully balanced on a fine line of a lot of bosses beeing difficult, rewarding and beeing annoying and unfun. And God. did they do it right in old games most of the times. In Elden Ring it seems like they were trying to keep a balance on that line after 10 shots of vodka and a 5kg rock glued to them on the ""unfun"" side. Oh. i forgot about the music, just speaks my opinion about it. forgettable. The only theme i can recognize main theme and Tree Sentinel because how many times it's reused.",0
Negative,"Don't play this unless you're a ""Souls pro"" or masochistic. It's a shame that not every player will get to experience all the fascinating lore, levels, monsters, etc. it has to offer simply because there's just too much to overcome. Death is so frequent and unforeseen that it's just meaningless. Every fight feels unfair. Utter lack of narrative.To me this ""Souls"" style is just anti-player.

Negative,"I've played every souls game there is. i absolutely love From software. But unfortunately this is the first From game ive played where i cant finish it.Combat: Its boring, tedious, the enemies are extremely bland and recycled from dark souls, the mechanics are recycled from dark souls. Infact you could say this is just ""open world dark souls"", The bosses are OK, but i cant get this overwhelming feeling of 'sigh'. The games creativity is horrific, enemies and bosses just spam the most stupid move sets ive ever seen. I genuinely hate the combat in this game. 5/10Exploration: The exploration was supposed to be on par with Zelda BOTW. I can tell you right now it doesnt come close. i explore every nook and cranny and i don't find anything satisfying. i cant be bothered traversing the boring landscape. 5/10Map: Youll find yourself running through areas with absolutely no intention of exploring them, your only thought will be ""how the hell do i get out of this dump of an area"". That being said the starting area was ok. 6/10Graphics: The graphics are shameful. at 4k 60fps, its runs worse than cyberpunk when it first came out for me. constant stuttering and crashing. I have 3080Ti, this shouldnt be happening. Ontop of all that, the graphics are a big step backwards from Sekrio, the shading is terrible. 3/10Music: The music is completely non existent. 0/10Overall: Im an avid From fan. But this game has to be their worst creation yet. I know fan boys will hate me, but thats the honest truth. I wont even finish it, its just not worth the time. Wait till its got at least a 50% discount. 5/10",0
Negative,"At this point, expecting the next Dark Souls to learn from the previous one's mistakes falls under the definition of insanity. Delving into the series' many problems: the terrible camera, the overloaded controls, the horribly implemented lock-on system, is useless. None of that is ever going to improve. And yes, Elden Ring is a Souls game, unlike Bloodborne or Sekiro. If the painfully slow combat didn't clue you in, then the twenty-odd poison swamps scattered about the open world, like pools of congealing vomit, should have given it away.Almost nothing in Elden Ring is truly new, but it would be unfair to criticize a game for its predecessors' failings when it's so much easier to point out all the wholly original ways it manages to disappoint. The boss design is horrible, barely a step above the contemptible Dark Souls 2 (known for such classics as: ""Guy Wearing Armor"", ""Ornstein and No Smough"", and ""Room Full of Rats""). Rather than making each encounter ebb and flow like an actual battle between two skilled (albeit mismatched) combatants, From Software decided what players wanted most was to hit a giant camera-breaking monstrosity once, then spend the next 30 seconds chasing it, while it spams AoE. Repeat until it either dies or drains your will to live.Asset recycling, From Software's inescapable tragic flaw, makes its triumphant return in Elden Ring. There are simply not enough unique enemies to fill a world as big as this one. Almost every single boss and miniboss is reused, repurposed, and reskinned just to give players enough things to fight. There's some kind of hairy snake creature (not a euphemism) that appears so often I can only assume it's being paid to work overtime. Dragons, the rarest and most memorable bosses in the previous Souls games, infest The Lands Between like rats. You don't even want to know how many rats there are.Mounted combat is abysmal in every game it's ever been put in, and Elden Ring is certainly no exception. Enemies turn on a dime, while your trusty steed is still trying to circumnavigate the Federal Reserve. Collision detection is borderline nonexistent. Swinging a weapon while you're on a horse gives you, at best, even odds of hitting whatever you're aiming at. Considering, getting hit can leave you prone, vulnerable to follow-up critical attacks (guaranteed death starting with the mid-game), you are literally gambling with your life whenever you choose to mount up.No amount of leveling could possibly give me the faith to believe anything in the late game was properly play-tested. Enemies and bosses (almost exclusively reskins of ones you've already fought) have ludicrous health pools, while also dealing ridiculous damage. Maybe this is meant to compensate for the ability to freely summon NPC allies, maybe it's because status effects like bleed and frost are incredibly broken. Whatever the reason, it makes the last 15 hours of Elden Ring a maddeningly tedious slog. Doggedly chipping away at increasingly bloated health bars, where the slightest mistake can cost you your life, feels like trying to tunnel your way out of a maximum security prison with a plastic spoon.Oh, and a word of warning to all the undeterred Souls aficionados still planning on buying Elden Ring on PC. This game is so badly optimized it makes the terrible Nioh port look competent by comparison. Expect stuttering, frame rate drops, and crashes, even on a brand new system well beyond the recommended specifications.Well, that's about it. Maybe in a year's time FromSoft will patch this game enough to make it both playable and fun, but I wouldn't hold my breath. On the spectrum of Soulslikes, where Sekiro and Hollow Knight stand proudly at one end and DS2's bloated corpse slowly decomposes at the other, Elden Ring draws just about level with Nioh - a semi-tolerable experience that gets exponentially worse the longer you keep going.",0

Negative,"I paid for 2 copies of this game because me and wife just wanted to play a cool game together.Thought process: The art. BEAUTIFUL, the size of the world. huge, the game seems to not hold your hand and you need to discover things as you go along (there's always the internet). right up my alley. Lets check gameplay: Hmmm looks clunky and repetitive, kinda unpolished (it is). but hey, I liked the Witcher it was similar. Looks like the mobs re-spawn every time your screen loads (they do). meh, I played world of warcraft.Lets do it: Turns out Coop is absolute f-ing garbage if you want to adventure together. You can research the details on why coop sucks, I'm not going to do that here, that horse is long dead. I just wanted to say how disappointed I was that this game advertised the coop as being sooo cool. For single player, its fine. THIS IS NOT A COMPLETE COOP GAME, unless your idea of coop is to meet up with your buddy to kill 1 boss together and everyone is cool that only the host of the coop group gets credit for the kill, then your team despawns. or if you die. your team despawns.

Negative,"Caveat: This one's for the older gamers out there, who play on PC and don't use a controller.This game is brilliant, I can completely see why people are saying everything they are about it, it truly is a masterpiece. Would I personally recommend it though?. No.It comes down for me to the combat, I'm just told old and don't have the dexterity and twitch reflexes in my hands playing on a keyboard to fight anything other than basic multiple foes, to deal with clever mini-bosses, or have a hope of beating anything but the most basic bosses.Now I know people will have read that and gone ""Idiot!, it's a Souls game what did you expect!?"", well I'd never played a Souls game before this one, and all the reviews were saying, if you are going play one this is the one to play, and it's different to other games, etc., so I took a chance. It didn't take me very long of playing and dying and losing my runes over and over and over again to realise that personally I was never going to get anywhere in it, and it was just going to frustrate and confound me constantly.Having said that, if you play with a controller, or have the dexterity and reflexes to deal with the combat on a keyboard, this could well be the best game you've ever played. it's just not for me.",0
Negative,"I would love to suggest it but so much of the game is just boring dungeons and underwhelming gank/rehash bosses. The story content is good enough that getting the game on sale could be good but as a general product, can't suggest it for 60 bucks, and especially not 80.",0
Negative,"When playing through linear area, or enclosed spaces the game shines. However so much of the world is just space to be travel across, and I find that very dull. Also the camera is still shit, and the input delay problems do not reflect well on the developers. Especially with how much progress the industry has made since Demon Souls. Buy it or don't, I'm not saying you shouldn't, just that the the game could be better.",0
Negative,"PvE Sorcerers are better than any melee build, CO-OP disconnects you after 5-10 minutes of play sometimes less, PvP is horrendously broken and not at all competitive. They opt to just throw the same bosses at you that you've seen before except instead you are fighting 2 of them. Open world gives no direction at all so you often have to leave areas and grind souls to come back later. Several bugged out bosses that you can just instakill. Armor doesnt seem to effect much outside of having higher poise. Cant hold a candle to any of the previous souls games.",0
Negative,"I have been thinking and thinking, about how to write this out. This is the only way I can put it. Elden Ring is a bad game.The list of problems I have had with this game is vast. Yet most of these problems are present in almost every FromSoft game out there. From Dark Souls to Bloodborne. The number of times I was hit by a weapon I was clearly out of reach of. To being pushed down a hole because I steeped a rock that was lightly poking out.So, oddly enough. One thing a lot of reviewers keep talking about is, how this game doesn't tell you where to go. Yet, to disprove that all you have to do is look at your map. The Lost Graces are clearly telling you which way to go. That this game has no waypoints. Truth is, that the waypoints are manual. Making the compass at the top of the screen useless unless you put a waypoint down. People are talking about this game as if it has changed how open-world games work. When in reality, it works just the same. With the illusion of fewer markers on your screen. This game falls into the same tropes almost all other open-world games fall into. Instant death zones and areas you get to by either invisible walls or not being able to mantle a ledge even though you know you could easily grab onto. Yet one of the biggest problems I have with this game is that it was made open-world. What I mean by that is, that all the booses and dungeons are almost all optional. I have heard there are over 90 bosses throughout the game. Yet it seems that the only bosses that apply to the main story number are from 10 to 12. Maybe even 14. (Not sure, I haven't finished the game and have no desire to.) The remaining bosses are all optional. Hell, the entire eastern end of the map is optional. Another thing to think about when it comes to the bosses is that most of them are duplicates of the same boss. I can't even begin to tell you how many times I fought Pumpkin Head. How the hell did he get on top of a tower where the only way up was a ladder with an opening smaller than his head? How many times do I have to fight a stone cat sphinx with either a sword or a staff for magic? People are also saying that the game doesn't do collectibles. (I.e. hidden packages from GTA.) Yet most of this game has you running around collecting materials. Want to make items, go and collect these plants. Want to upgrade your weapon, go collect smithing stones. It's not even a different type of collecting. This has been in the Soulsborne games since the start.I have heard this game be praised to high Heaven. Some even call it one of the greatest games of all time. I believe this is only the case because of the competition that surrounds it. Plus, adding the practices of the other companies. Of course, this would seem better than it truly is. I'm not gonna say it was the worst game I have played. Hell, it's not even the worst Soulsborne game I have played. (That still belongs to DS2.) But I can not and will not say this is a good game. If you wish to try it, do so, but I would say you could most likely find a better game worth your time and money.",0
Negative,When it runs it is fun but after the last patch the game will randomly hang on launch just sitting there at no responding. As it is currently I would not recommend this for anyone on PC.,0

Negative,"VERY BADLY OPTIMZED. STAY AWAY IF YOU DON'T OR ONLY BARELY MET ITS SPEC REQUIREMENTSThe game itself is great tho. The combat is just like your typical Souls game, but the world is sooo huge and dense. You'll never feel like it's an empty world.",0
Negative,"I absolutely love this game, I played it on my friends Xbox and wanted to get it myself! The problem is it is not at ALL optimized for PC at this time which is very disappointing. I've spent my entire play time trying to fix a single bug that makes the game nearly unplayable. All entities, NPC and enemy are completely invisible. Now I've seen people say its a fps problem or a graphics issue but my game runs fine on full graphics since I have a pretty beefy computer. Not to mention that if I make my settings garbage they still are not appearing. There are a lot of other silly bugs like stuttering problems and items disappearing, but the invisible enemies was really the last nail in the coffin. I'll probably play this more and love it later but for how glitchy it is in the moment I have to give this a bad reviewShould you buy this game? For PC maybe not yet. I'd wait a bit until they've fleshed out more bugs. For console I'd definitely buy it.Its not a bad game! If you're a fan of Bloodborn or Dark Souls this is your game but just be ready for bugs and fps problems.",0
Negative,"So im a bit of a completionist, i have a save with over 100 hours in on it and its still in new game. This game LOOKS beautiful, the world is VERY well written, and the combat is engaging and fun most of the time. However that being said, the story is basically elements from previous soulsbourne titles thrown together with a new skin. They should've let George RR martin write the story instead of just the world lore. The UI is. well its not good, it could've been done so much better, the controls sometimes don't do what they are supposed to ( delayed inputs, inputs not registering at all and a few other issues ). There are systems that could have been consolidated to make them flow better. My last point, the stutter. Stuttering in this game is absolutely ridiculous, and we are two weeks into release with no fix yet, i have a high end rig and have done every fix the community has suggested, all to no avail. FromSoft ports are usually a mess, but this takes the cake. i have had moments where the game will stutter mid boss fight and i take a hit because the boss is a few frames ahead of whats being displayed. The near constant stutters and frame lag which myself, my wife, and many other people have reported happening is being downplayed by the overwhelming majority of people, but that doesn't change the fact that its a well documented issue and people are trying to act like it doesn't exist. I cant in good faith recommend this until FromSoft patches the stuttering out. As soon as the frame stuttering is patched? instantly recommended. Now for actual game-play. The game plays great, albeit there are some SERIOUS balance issues, poise is basically useless ( you can be wearing the heaviest set in the game and still be staggered by a rat ), there are numerous spells / weapon arts / combinations of things that aren't supposed to interact with each-other but do ( leading to abuse in invasions and co op ) tons of weapon arts and weapons that are just so strong that if you have it you win most encounters, and an overall lack of general balancing.As the game stands now, i give it a solid 8.5 out of 10, with the potential to be a 9.5 once they patch the stutters, and properly balance some of the things that really are just too strong. I still don't understand all of the perfect scores for this game. The game is fantastic don't get me wrong, but it isn't a perfect 10, nor would it be even if they fixed its issues.",0

Negative,"If you like Dark Souls/soulslike games and want more I'd get itIf you're not sure about Dark Souls/soulslikes I'd start with Dark SoulsThe open world features are kind of half baked and it definitely ruins progression. I'm sure there are some decent armors and weapons in the starting area that I havent found, but 16 and a half hours in and I'm stuck with my starting gear.Bosses take after Bloodborne bosses in rythm and increase agression. I like bloodborne, but its missing core mechanics that make Bloodborne bosses work. The health regen you get on strike is missing, which means you can't match the increased aggression. Your only option is dodge rolling away during a combo and trying to get a sneaky hit in every now and again.In addition, bosses are either too easy or too difficult. There is never a sweet spot challenge that is just the right level of satisfying. I blame this on the fact that because its open world the designers have no idea what level the player will be when they encounter a boss, where as the more linear design of DS controlled that better. Even if you were grinding to get souls the exponential cost of levels and the number of souls enemies gives you in any specific area makes it really hard to overlevel for a boss, and likewise if you are underleveled the base enemies give you more souls. Other openworld games with RPG mechanics, for example the Witcher 3, tell the player what level they should be for a particular quest, its not exactly dietetic, but neither is going on the wiki for that information.,Invasions in DS were never ideal but relegating them to co-op is kind of ****.Darksouls is tighter, at least for the first part, in terms of design. I'd recommend it or DS3 over Eldenring.",0
Negative,"I've never played Darker Souls and was ready to hate myself going into this game. Well, I did hate myself, but I didn't hate the game. I knew it was meant to be hard and slowly but surely I got a little better. I actually started to enjoy myself ""mid-game"", but once I got to late game, I wasn't enjoying anything about this game anymore. It turned into a grind fest for runes to level up to get power or HP just to be one shot by, the more I think about it, creatures designed with zero true artistry. Monsters are meant to be hard and interesting, but after almost 60 hours playing as a fresh set of eyes to a game like this I have zero respect for the designers of the fights. The world itself, amazing, but you easily lose that awe because you end of fighting a creature that didn't have thought put into it. It just had code put into it to have it mercilessly attack. You think you're going to roll away, it attacks too fast for you to. You think you're going to block, it attacks until you're out of stamina and can't block. You think you're going to cast spells at it, nah, it can vanish and teleport right in front of you then attack non-stop. I really wanted to enjoy this game and thought around mid-game I actually was getting into it, but It gets too damn tiring, not dying to being out played, but just simply dying to creatures created with the lowest of design IQ. It's not hard to write code to have something attack constantly. People always told me it being hard is what makes it fun, because you have a sense of accomplishment. I have no argument for that, I understand that mentality, but the problem is, this game isn't designed (the fights and monsters anyway) to be a smart challenge. It feels like nothing more than a beautiful world but extremely lazy creature mechanics and user play. I want the game to be hard. I like a challenge, but I don't like having to constantly go to a wiki just to figure out a quest, or basic thing, or run around after spending hours grinding runes and leveling up just to be 2 shot by the first thing I run into. Again, not because it outplayed me, but because it simply just attacks non stop. It's the most pathetic design of fight mechanics I've ever seen and I can officially say after putting in 60 hours as a newcomer to this style of game, I would never recommend this to anyone. You don't get a challenge out of it because it's nowhere near a fair fight 90% of the time. You just get lucky or spend a ton of time farming.",0
Negative,"Over the two years since this games release I have had a lot of time to ponder and discuss this game with friends and strangers alike, and with the arrival of the DLC soon I thought I'd update my review and give some quick thoughts on the game.Elden Ring is a massive step down from previous Fromsoft titles. 1. It features the most boring world and story they have ever released. This is the first game I have seen from them where the Lore is legitimately unintelligible.2. Garbage balance for PvE and PvP (full of one shots and broken gimmicks) and PvP is unrewarding with no real reason to even engage with it.3. Pointless padding with awful side dungeons and a pointless open map to trend chase. 4. Second half of the game is comparable in quality to DaS1's second half with any exploration you'd find in the first half of the game is removed.This might be the worst game modern Fromsoft has released. Will the DLC fix any of these issues? Maybe, the lore being the biggest one. If the base game is anything to go by the DLC will likely just be more of the trash they had during the second half of the game. I honestly wish I could get a refund. Go play better Fromsoft games like Sekiro, Armored Core 6 or the Dark Souls trilogy.",0

Negative,"I made a negative review about the game when it launched due to its horrific state of performance and I said that I would revise my review after it becomes playable. Now that the game's performance has been stabilized, I put some time into the game and here are my thoughts.I am disappointed. I love the Dark Souls games dearly and the Dark Souls series, along with Sekiro, are some of my favourite games. So where did this game go so wrong?Before I get into the negatives, let me give credit where it is due. The visuals - Elden Ring is definitely one the best looking video games I've ever seen. The world design - There is no doubt that the devs were very creative and imaginative when constructing the world. The crafting system - It can be ignored, but it's a nice thing to have for those who want it. Horse riding - It feels responsive and is well made. It complements the game's massive world.These are the things I cannot personally commend nor can I say they're bad. The lore - FromSoftware has always had great lore and writing, but Elden Ring's lore just felt really weird and I couldn't get into it. Because this is likely due to a personal bias, I am listing it as neutral. The soundtrack - Just like with lore, FromSoftware's games have had amazing OSTs, but Elden Ring's OSTs don't stand out as much. Most of them sound similar, have a similar vibe, have very little creativity and variety when compared to, for example, the first Dark Souls. This is listed as neutral because there are some really good tracks, but most of it I would consider mediocre.And now, the list of things that made me not like the game. Reused enemies and bosses - While this may not sound like an issue, Elden Ring does it simply way too much. I can tolerate it to a certain degree, but when they literally reuse a main story boss in a random challenge-like boss arena, that's when it becomes unacceptable. It also ties in directly to the next issue. The world itself - It is simply far too large. There was a choice to be made: either quality over quantity, or quantity over quality. The developers went for the latter. The world could have been half of its current size, maybe even less, and it still wouldn't change how good or fun the game overall is. The only thing making such a large map brought was the fact that the developers didn't have enough things to fill it with, and so they had no other choice but to keep reusing bosses to make it feel not empty. The bossfights - The previous games did bossfights well. In Dark Souls, they were fun to dodge and counter during the right openings. In Sekiro, parrying each strike of your enemy was a thrill. But Elden Ring just don't feel fun. They have extremely long combos they can seemingly weave one after another with little pause and almost every boss is equipped with some hard to react to AoE move that they do once in a while (or all the time, depends on the boss). Combine this with their unnaturally long windups for attacks, their input reading (they react to you using an item or casting a spell instantly) and you're left with a not very enjoyable experience. It is clear that the bossfights were designed around using the spirit ashes summons, but if you use them, the game becomes too easy. Refuse to use them, and the game is frankly just so hard that it felt tedious and not worth my time.To conclude the review: the game has clearly several strong points and things it did well, but the main focus of souls-like games is the bossfights, and they feel tedious, artificial, and I never really felt satisfied beating them. Their older games had great bosses, so why couldn't this one as well?",0
Negative,"I downloaded the game and currently when attempting to boot it the easy anti cheat loads fine, but the game itself is a blank white screen and then crashes about 10-15 seconds later. I so far have paid 60 dollars for a picture and a white screen that crashes.",0

What is it about the ignorance of ultrawide screen format in your company? Why do you hate ultrawide? Or is it that you cannot afford some ultrawide screen monitors for your devs? But from the underpaid salary that you pay your engineers with I'd think you have enough money on the side to afford some better monitors.Apart from that I don't know what the ruckus is about this game. It feels like a graphically upped Dark Souls but the graphics are still dull without a Reshade. I guess FromSoftware still also hasn't heard about post processing effects.The menus and UI are a frustration to use. This is not an overreaction, it is really bad.Can't remap some keys that I normally always would use for certain actions. Because why?The music is standard gloomy, orchestral Hans Zimmer-like blare. Nothing special to listen here.I honestly have a hard time thinking of a more overhyped game developer than FromSoftware.And all this disappointment for the premium price of over 9000 Yen!Why isn't FromSoftware coming to my home and slap me in the face directly instead? It would be easier!REFUNDED!",0

Negative,"40 hours into the game, crashed after killing a mini boss, now have the invisible enemies bug. There is a mega thread about it on the steam discussion board. Some of the folks on that thread have had the problem since day one. Two days trouble shooting, trying all the suggestions with no results. The game is now unplayable.Camera following can cause motion sickness if you like to swing your camera around you while you are moving, unlike the console, the camera keeps trying to return to it's last position, which can cause the nausea.I have the game on both xbox and PS4, it plays wonderfully there. But I am a PC gamer, I purchased a game for the PC. I""d rather play on my PC. However it appears the PC gamer is an after thought.Buy the game on one of the consoles, install and enjoy.

I even have a 2070 super, so I don't know what to tell you. I originally thought that something was wrong with my pc, but temps and everything was normal. Every other game that I play functions just fine. Fromsoft, you really need to fix this. If you do, easy recommend on my part. I have no idea how Fromsoft was able to mess up the pc port of elden ring so bad that it runs worse than the darksouls remastered port on switch.",0
Negative,The sword play and multiplayer system is TRASH!,0
Negative,Do not recommend until stutter is fixed,0
Negative,"Great game. Loving every second of it. But fuck EAC. EAC should be removed from this game. There are many linux-friendly, less spyware-ish anti-cheats like Valve's VAC. I will turn this review to positive once EAC is removed.Meanwhile, you all can play the game without EAC, look up how to do that, and you'll have better performance, experience and all, but without being able to play online. I'm missing on a part of the game's content because of this, but it's 100% worth it. Works well on Linux.",0
Negative,"This is the worst game experience I have ever had playing a game. Would equate the game experience to cyberpunk in glitches issues and downright unacceptable performance. Fully kitted computer (Cpu 5900x + GPU 6900XT) is dropping frames like I'm playing on a laptop. Took me ages to figure out how to change it to mouse and keyboard. Menu system is garbage. I could keep going about the gameplay problems, but there so many, im leaving it here.",0
Negative,"Prologue These are the reasons why i dont like Elden ring some of them may be biased but it is a review after all The PVP Due to the changes to the invasions, the original style of invasions is all but impossible, forcing any invader to rely heavily on overpowered builds and minmaxing, reducing the potential variety in builds.This also does not take into account the invasion placements that are outright broken, placing invaders in locations where it is impossible to reach the host.The most obvious example is Castle Morne. The Balance While this issue was certainly present in previous games, there is much higher potential for 1HKO builds and other such overpowered builds in the Elden Ring. While the problem isn't too bad, combined with the previous issue, This creates a pvp environment where fighting is not encouraged and instead ambushes with spells are preferred, reducing the potential of pvp. The Environment Compared to Dark Souls 1-3 The environment present in the elder ring is much worse for pvp overall. In the previous games, you could use the environment to your advantage and for unique and fun duels or battles.While this may be more biased compared to the other points, I believe others also know what I'm talking about. The previous games had much more unique environments, almost every area providing different ways of killing the host besides the usual. Stability of the network and the game This issue may be fixed later, so this point will be rendered moot when it is fixed.Current pvp issues are unacceptable. Having half of your invasions end due to connection issues, the game freezing and stuttering does not help either. Closing RemarksAs someone who has completed and played several NG+ runs in all three games, I can say that the Elden Ring is not well designed for pvp; rather, it feels more like Dark Souls being presented to a casual audience and people who enjoy PVE.While this is not bad for people that like PVE, it removes one of the best aspects of Dark Souls, which was its PVP.TLDR: Dont play elden ring for dark souls Combat or PVP you wont find much fun in it",0
Negative,"Gaemplay- Lots of customisability with the ashes of war (abilities) and the generous amount of weapons to choose from - An open world dark souls makes the most sense as far as direction goes for the series, unless they doubled down with another sekiro style game. Therefore it should have been dark souls 4, as there isn't an enormous change from DS3- So much content! I feel like the open world is padded out a little however. Maybe it's just for realism. Most corners have content in them however. Added padding from the horrific amount of bosses that are reused - Magic/melee combos feeling a little OP this time around, but at least magics is a bit more accessable Performance:- Stutter in open world, helped by patch, but still as low as 40fps in some open world areas (1660ti and i5 10600K)- No fullscreen borderless- On exit, remains for 15 seconds plus music- Any gamescreen loads in about 6 seconds on my machine! Even from the main menu- I enjoy that the teleporters will give hardcore players the ability to travel to harder realms very quickly Quality of life:- sometimes one cannot fast travel from the bonfire of an entrance to a cave or catacomb, forcing you to exit the screen run outside, then travel- when on horseback, one cannot pick up items whilst moving. I can see why this may have been done to force a player to clear an area of enemies before taking an item, but with the right positioning and momentum, one can achieve this anyhow- Limited ability to customise clothing- The great rune's activation requirements are not quite clear enough- Limited HUD customisability, a shame, because the graphics are greatGraphics- A decent amount of gfx options- I would have considered in this day and age more additions such as choice of anti aliasing types - No widescreen option - Art direction is fantastic. Some of the later levels are spectacular in their ability to create forboding and fear Story- I'm only 40 hours in and I'm not exactly sure how the main characters fit in. I understand the narrative with the ring though, and the fingers. Not sure about the tree. A shame because the previous installments were not quite so convoluted and confusing. - The intro cinematics in the series are legendary. I feel like this one is just a bit silly. Compare it to the cinematic launch trailer. They're so different in feel.Music- Great again, but not my favourite OST in the series In SummaryMore of what we know and love, this time more accessable than ever. The dark souls series going in an open world direction makes perfect sense, but does stumble with some teething issues. Overall I feel like not enough of what made the originals classics is here. I cannot recommend based on the lazy porting, but I know I will replay this game.",0

Negative,I ve never seen such a bad PC adaptation of a game. For that money it s just an impudence. I ask for a refund after less then 1h playtime.,0
Negative,"Desperately want to be able to play this game, but in its current release it's extremely bugged, even with a few patches-currently bedeviling me is a bug I cannot get rid of no matter how hard I try, which is that all enemies and my horse have gone completely invisible. I walk out into a field and die in four hits because an invisible gargoyle has swooped down at me and clawed out my kidney when I couldn't see them. Impossible to make any progress with it!Maybe when it's fixed and patched, we can all enjoy a bunch of fucked up guys cackling at us, but right now it's in a sorry state on PC.",0
Negative,"I must say, it is certainly an amazing game and I am having a lot of fun, when I'm able to. There's a 50/50 chance on launch for it to take 10 minutes to boot, in the meantime completely freezing up my pc. The framerate is quite inconsistent with an abundance of stuttering issues that occur all over the map.For clarification I am currently trying to play through with a friend of mine, and when we summon eachother there's about a 30% chance that one of us will crash. Connection with other players is abysmal, we'll be fighting off invaders only for either my friend or the invader to just disconnect. Recently most of the invasions that have been happening to us end in the invader being stuck in the world frozen in place or walking into a wall/on the spot, with the only way to get rid of them to Alt+F4.In conclusion, it is a very fun game and already one of my favourites. But with how frequent and abundant these issues are, it just completely negates the fun of it and ends up being annoying in the end.EDIT: I've kept on playing and have gotten real close to the end of the game now with my friend, and I wish I could give it a worse rating. The connection issues have become even more rampant with my friend and I trying to fight a boss but either of us keeps disconnecting within a few minutes. Crashes when summoning each other are more frequent and the very long launch issues are still present. I don't know if we're just unlucky with this game, but on the technical side it's an utter piece of shit that barely works.",0
Negative,"its just dark souls, thats it, its dark souls. I got in after the tutorial, went to the only place marked on my map, killed rats and was transported to a crystal cave from which there was no fast traveling from. giant centipede glitched through the wall and killed me, rinse repeat until i just quit. same crap as the last 3 games",0
Negative,"multiplayer is still as bad as it was in 5 previous souls games. you're spending more time connecting than you are playing. there are disconnects constantly, and you get invaded cosntantly, so the moment where you explore together never comes before you die or disconnect.",0
Negative,So I do genuinely like these kindS of games but I was trying to play with my friends and well it was so difficult to play with them I would hardly call it a co-op style game. If you're looking for a straight forward single player story style game this is a good choice for you; but if you're hoping to be able to play with friends in a quick and easy fashion then I would avoid this game. It's like companies never learned from issues of this style of multiplayer in the past. You may as well have just made it single player.I know I have not played much of the game itself although my negative review stems from the lackluster co-op game play experience. if this were simply a single player game or even a better multiplayer; ie like being able to directly join friends not jump through hoops to match make only to have it ruined by a random death and then need to jump through hoops again just to play together.Overall I am sure the game is great if you remove all the poor multiplayer aspects and probably a stunning story telling game. So again if you're looking for a good story telling single player game this is a great choice. But I would think again if you're like me looking to play it with friends its just not worth the hassle.,0
Negative,"I woke up in a right steaming mood today, because i live in fucking Birmingham. This place is a shithole and its full of dickheads",0

Negative,too easy 4 me,0
Negative,"ELDEN RING is a good 3rd person rpg game. ELDEN RING is not a good Dark Souls game!Now while the exploration is fun and interesting, I cant help but feel it got tedious after the 50 hour mark, there's no creativity in approaching things, if you want to get somewhere you're either going through a cave to get there, a waygate (teleporter) or running on horseback around mountains looking for a path that leads you upwards/down. Most of the time you'll have to do this 3 or 4 times. With ELDEN RING being openworld you're going to encounter dungeon & caves, small towns and POI's. This is where most of my enjoyment came from, however, when you hit mid-game you'll start seeing the same bosses in caves & dungeons, sometimes they'll throw 2 of the same boss just to make it a lil more difficult. Again ELDEN RING becomes tedious for me. The bosses in this game are some the best looking bosses I've ever seen. I only have 2 issues: any boss in a open area can be cheesed, for example the first Tree Sentinel you encounter you can use your horse to jump on top of the church & spam any range attack. This strat carries it way through the entire game, if there's a boss in a open area, you can probably cheese it. I think it speaks volumes that the only time I had to be creative about taking a fight was how I was going to cheese said boss. Why? why cheese? When you start ELDEN RING you'll start to notice A LOT of bosses have a 1-2 shot attack that'll insta kill you & this doesn't change as the game goes on. Radahn and Malenia are the worst offenders of this. I dont know why but respec is needed in this game to progress & I hate it, you'll start with a build and end up changing it when you encounter a boss that f's you. The entire time I was playing this game it felt like it was entirely built around being a mage & I wasn't wrong, most top tier melee builds require Intelligence. THIS is the most ""unbalanced"" sorceries have ever been & the fact that most melee builds run Intelligence proves my point. IF you aren't a hybrid melee mage build you're using only jump attacks to keep up with the damage your peers are doing. I want to enjoy this game, I want to love it but if this is suppose to be the combination of all the experience, the f ups & all the good things from DS1/2/3 & Bloodborne it's so lackluster and unfinished I cannot recommend it. I'll end it here but this game feels like a high budget fan game or like it was made by souls fans with no direction.",0

Poor frame rate, no ultra wide support, multiplayer works occasionally and will randomly boot players, fights randomly bug out and the controls are unresponsive and rubberband-like, frame rate hitching throughout the game, especially while mounted and making turns and jumps.

As it is now, it's a potentially 10/10 game brought down to a 2/10 by its technical issues.",0
Negative,"If Dark Souls story telling bored you to no end, this is not much better. You're lost, alone in the world with random hostiles attacking you for no apparent reason.

Negative,"honeymoon phase is over, time to get real:forcing 60fps AND a 60hz cap in 2022 is just poor game design. like why would a game ever force my monitor to run at 60hz? Fromsoft is just braindeadi have 3060ti, 5600x and the performance is terriblethe game is pretty good tho",0
Negative,"Its a decent game. But I can't give it a positive review despite what the majority say. The poor PC performance is unacceptable for sure. Diving into the game we get Open world. that is the bane of this game in my opinion. With a wide open large map you get some mechanic to explore and traverse the world, a Horse. The horse is in my opinion the worst aspect of the game. The combat is shallow while mounted. Simple left right attacks which can only be used in hit and run tactics. This evolves into stale world design since with such a fast travel mechanic you need wide empty spaces in the world to traverse with not much to do. The only reminder of a good souls game is the castles which begs the question, why not just have good level design with a fairly clear path like dark souls 1,2 3? Just a humble opinion but i believe the game has started to stray to the empty open world likes of Skyrim and fallout.",0
Negative,"Great game,. Worth the money, It's Dark Souls 4 with an open world and a mount.BUT! 3 Issues I don't like:1. looks terrible on Ultra-wide. Sorry but it's 2022.!2.

HDR is broken and washed out.3. Serious stutter unless you go full tech mode to configure.- Update JUL 2024 -1. Game is amazing!2. However still no support for the above HDR / Widescreen / Upscallers (to enjoy ray tracing)3.

Negative,"Amazing game but it crashes every 20 minutes. Just lost 50k souls from a dragon boss because it crashed and didn't me the souls again. Unacceptable. I can't recommend the pc version is this state, really annoying to play.",0
Negative,Game stutters a lot and has many performance issues. Game has crashed over 20 times and has actually crashed my PC. I honestly think this game has messed up my PC after the most recent update. Fingers crossed this factory reset fixes it because I couldn't play anything.,0
Negative,"Horrible bugs. Game flashes a back, and/or breaks completely, enemies are invisible, etc. So many problems I can't count. I have 3 hours of game time just trying to debug and trouble shoot issues. Terrible experience. I wouldn't recommend this to my worst enemy.",0
Negative,"The game is so poorly optimized on PC that I'm getting headaches by playing it. I'm getting between 30-40 FPS on a PC with an RTX 3070, i7-8700k and 32 GB RAM, even when I tried on medium settings and reduced my display to from 1440p to 1080p. Unacceptable for an AAA game. And yes, my drivers are updated.The starting area of the game was fun though, had stable 60 FPS there (not higher because FROM Software still haven't figured out that lots of PC players play on 144hz+ screens).Otherwise the game looks cool, with lots of places to explore and a good combat system.",0
Negative,"Game has a lot of PC specific issues. Including persistent issues with Steam Cloud Sync that can result in lost save files. Specifically, the game will often fail to properly sync with the cloud and prompt you to manually resolve this.This prompt doesn't warn you that local files are about to to be deleted, nor does it make any backup of the saves it overwrites.This is the default steam cloud behavior that has existed in its awful, broken state for years.Definitely make manual backups of your saves and probably turn off Steam Cloud Sync until this issue is fixed.You're probably better off just buying this on console.",0
Negative,"Game break performance issues still persist a week after launch with no plan in sight to fix it. I can frame drop my way through the first few hours of this experience enough to find out the game isn't even worth it even if they can fix the performance issues. This game is just empty space, littered with my grace sites (bonfires) than should ever be allowed in a souls-like game. If any other developer made this game and called it a souls-like game people would immediately bash it for being too easy and there being way to many bonfires. THIS GAME HAS 96 BONFIRES. Can you imagine any other souls-like game with 96 bonfires? It just means the game is far too easy. Because you can fast travel between all of these points and rarely is getting to the next grace site all that difficult. With the horse you just literally shoot past anything that can deal damage. I'll just stick to dark souls.",0
Negative,"The lack of widescreen support is no longer excusable. The game is booting into 32:9 and 21:9 on it's own in rare occasions, so it's obviously possible. Alpha Indie games have better monitor support.",0

Some fixes even list disabling steam overlay or uninstalling epic, what the hell? I wanted to like it, I wanted to love it, but it is so badly optimized that I actually hate it. It's been such a terrible headache that even if they fixed it at this point I think I wouldn't even be interested.Save yourself the heartache and skip this on PC at least. At this point I just hope I get my refund and can move on from this mess.",0
Negative,"Again, I have a problem that starting occurring only after playing the game with no problems for several dozen hours; there is unbearable stuttering whenever I perform actions in the game, even just jumping on my horse will cause stuttering. Several dozen hours with no stuttering on high graphics settings rendered at 1080p, now it is unplayable even when I tried it on low graphics settings at 720p. Really, really sucks, because the game is amazing.",0
Negative,"Big fan of basically every Dark Souls game. I played the hell out of DS3.I've now played like 200 hours of this game, and my opinion hasn't fundamentally changed.Way too much copy+paste content. Bosses are reused EVERYWHERE. A lot of bosses that are just reskins of other bosses. Every dragon fight is exactly the same. There are basically 2 different styles of dungeon that are copy+pasted all over the map, and the bosses in them are also mostly copy+pasted.Bugs bugs bugs. Bugs everywhere. Multiplayer matchmaking bugs, random disconnects, frame drops, input lag. Crashes. Try to summon a friend? It fails. Now you can't attempt to summon anyone else until you relaunch the game or die. Want bugs? You name it, it has it. How about the bug where an invader gets teleported into a boss room with you rather than getting ejected from the session. Speaking of bosses, the worst bosses of any Souls game. I've beaten nearly every major boss in the game. I think I genuinely enjoyed maybe 5 of them. The rest were an exercise in tedium. Watch the boss chain combos together while dodging for 2 minutes. Get a single hit in. Repeat.For whatever reason they decided to cover many boss arenas in random breakable objects that you can get stuck on. You will be fighting the camera and the terrain as often as the boss. Back in the day each souls boss would have a thing that made it hard. It might be heavy damage, it might be heavy tracking, it might be combos, it might be AOE nukes, it might be deceptive delay on their attacks. Now, for the most part, all the bosses have all of those things. DS3 bosses were difficult and fun. In Elden Ring they're just difficult.With the following exceptions-these bosses are genuinely good:-Morgott-Renalla-Godrick-Godfrey-LorettaBasically every other boss is, mechanically speaking, terrible.In terms of design/visuals/music, all top notch of course. But the gameplay falls flat on its face.Oh, and also bosses input scan now, so the boss will attack the moment you hit the button to drink the flask. You think you have a window to cast a spell? Wrong. The quick, long range attack he needs to use to interrupt you happens the moment you hit the button. Why? Because screw you, that's why.I'm sure this flavor of cheating probably happened in older DS titles, but it was never this blatant, obvious, and damaging to gameplay.Balance issues. Holy mother of God, the balance issues. Want to play a full melee strength build. Hah. Good luck. Figure you can just upgrade the sword of your choosing and be able to make it through the game as in previous titles? Nope. Enjoy getting curb stomped. Play with the sword of night and flame, on the other hand? Now you're on easy mode. You can 3-shot the first major boss of the game with that sword at only +5.Balance issues extend to magic as well. Swarm of Flies. It's so broken. I literally nuked the Blood God down to 0 health (through bleed damage, ironically) bypassing his second phase entirely. This spell is so broken for certain enemies.The balance issues with the game are so glaring that they had to add a system for NPC summons as a crutch for bosses. There are bosses that are basically impossible for a mage to fight alone. There are other bosses that are basically impossible for a melee character to fight alone. Everybody loses. Whee.All and all, is this game BAD? I don't know. Probably not really? But it has so many glaring problems, many of which are issues that didn't exist in previous titles. We know they know how to make games properly. We should expect better.Except for the multiplayer bugs, they don't know how to make fully functioning multiplayer games. Multiplayer has been buggy in literally every From game ever.",0
Negative,"Just want so say upfront, the game is awesome! .if you want to play single player.My reason for not recommending is based pretty much entirely on the absolutely terrible multiplayer. If co-op/multiplayer is not important to you or not desired then I do recommend this game for you!So first things first; yes, I am aware ""this is how dark souls multiplayer has always been"" but that doesn't make it good. The only positives I have seen about multiplayer have been ""well its a little better then dark souls this time!""Play pretty much any game with co-op/multiplayer from the last decade and you will immediately see how bad elden ring is at it.1) You cant invite your friends directly, instead you or your friend have to place a gold plaque on the ground so the other person can find it and summon. And I hope you and your friend used the password system to narrow down who's gold plaque you can see and who can see yours to limit the chance of someone else using the summon instead of your friend. 2) You have to craft an item to even see your friends gold plaque, and its single use. The material needed to craft is easy to find which somehow just makes this even more pointless.3) The person who is summoned has their flasks reduced by half (rounded down to boot), and Sites of Grace, merchants, and mount are disabled for everyone.(site of grace might actually be only kind of limited?, one time my friend was able to trigger the site of grace to refill flasks during co-op but we couldn't get it to work again. so maybe a bug or on a timer or something)4) When you or your co-op friend die or even BEAT A BOSS the connection is severed and you have to go through the whole gold plaque remedy routine again. And you and your friend will die. repeatedly. 5) There is no way to stop invasions from happening without turning off online all together. All of this adds up to one of the worst, if not THE worst, most needlessly frustrating multiplayer/co-op experience I have played in over a decade.tl;drdo not buy if you wanted to play this game co-op with friends.

Negative,"The PC performance is abysmal. You can have the best hardware you can buy and this game wont run consistent 60fps (!) on LOW settings. The game crashes my driver to the point of OS failure every several hours. The fact that this was made by one of the most prestigious studios on the planet is hilarious. (This is one of the highest sold video games of all time now, Souls is far from a ""niche"" genre at this point.)Concerning the gameplay, this is basically DS3 in an open world. They made it more ""difficult"" by giving the enemies bloodborne style fast animations, but leaving you slower than in the previous games. Heavy (slow) weapons are garbage, the fastest bosses wont give you an opening to attack. To compensate for this, they added absurdly overpowered weapon arts that can kill the same bosses in 3 or 4 hits. (They completely screw the PVP balance as well - looking at you, Moonveil Katana) This kind of balancing can be expected from an indie studio, but not people who have been creating these games for over a decade now.The world is pretty, the story (and setting) is the same as all the other previous Souls games. Only get it if you're a hardcore Soulsborne fan, otherwise pass.",0
Negative,"Unfortunately, I can't honestly recommend this game to anyone on PC for the time being. It has insane instability issues even though I'm rocking an EVGA FTW3 RTX 3080 GPU and a Ryzen CPU. When the game works, it's phenomenal! Beautiful graphics, engaging combat, etc. but all those kudos go right out the door when the game crashes constantly, disconnects from multiplayer repeatedly, and, most recently, causes my entire computer to do a hard reboot without any warning.I'm not returning the game for hope of permanent fixes via patching but. damn is the game in bad shape right now. Gonna take a break and come back in a few weeks.",0
Negative,Still can't play it :( The stutters make it unbearable.Edit: Needed to disable Discord-Overlay and Steam-Overlay to stop the stuttering. No other game needs this. why?,0
Negative,"About halfway through you realize every enemy is copy pasted from the first 3-ish areas, and the game design gets more and more gimmicky and relies on filling a condensed area with as many enemies as your computer can render. Not to mention the ending is 3 vague sentences which feels like a slap to the face after sinking so many hours into it. The game should have been about half the length with way less repetitiveness. There's also no guidance as to what areas you should head to next which just causes a huge mess. The open world really hurt the game. Technical issues aside, I think this may be my least favorite souls game. I stopped enjoying it after the laziness became apparent.",0
Negative,terrible game. boring as hell,0
Negative,"Has some really great moments and is MOSTLY a great game. But is let down by recycled bosses, lazy bosses with two enemies in an enclosed room that leave absolutely zero room for attack because they both spam a constant stream of attacks. PVP is the worst ever in a souls game because anything faith/int based is so insanely overpowered that everyone just spams the same spell or weapon art over and over, which makes pvp get dull and painful to play fast. I've had people duel me who can fire off about 5 different spells all within a second of each other and it is completely unavoidable because of the sheer amount of spells being cast and ridiculously gimmicky/spam reliant weapon arts/attacks.",0
Negative,"after 100 hours of eldan ring, i can render my full verdict. and that is its alright, im at lvl 130 and i still have 1/3 of the game to go and im just wishing the game was over. game play is good, so is the fighting mechanics, but direction is severely lacking, as is memorable content. with 238 bosses, and most of the being incredibly easy, its hard to point out one that i really liked or had trouble with, all of them just seem like just another boss fight. I also feel the story feels weak, it doesnt feel mysterious or cryptic, it just seems overly complimented and not bound together well. the other soulsborne games had a ""dig for the truth and you will be rewarded"" thing that this one doesnt have. i think it is my least favorite soulsborne game, as it is just more, instead of better",0
Negative,Worse than Dark Souls 2,0
Negative,"Ehhh bad ports, what can you do?",0
Negative,game is fucking ass,0
Negative,Reasons why Elden Ring is trash. You can't take Blaidd out for walkies You can't tell Blaidd he's a good boi You can't adventure with Blaidd You can't give Blaidd head pats or scritches behind the ears (those are his favorite; but he'd never admit it.)Until FromSoftware fixes this issue I just can't recommend the game.,0
Negative,I stopped playing the game because a crash that as I see happenned to many other folks as of now lost me 18 hours of gameplay and from lvl 54 now I a lvl 38. Of coourse 3-4 Bosses and now that i have to work (I was sick) it would take me 14 days to get back to the same spot. IN this game this is just unacceptable. Of course there is no way to get any of the save files.,0
Negative,all of a sudden im getting horrible stutter that makes the game unplayable after the most recent patch. fucking stupid bullshitedit:so apparently u have to go into device manager and disable something called microsoft device association root enumerator and that fixes the awful stutters. WOW THATS SO COOL! AFTER SPENDING FIVE FUCKING HOURS TRYING TO TROUBLE SHOOT THIS GAME I CAN FINALLY PLAY IT AGAIN AFTER IT UPDATED ITSELF WITH A PATCH THAT BROKE THE GAME! SICK!,0
Negative,"PC controls are bizarre, several important functions are both hard locked and not even written down anywhere (map is G, for example). All the loading screen tips and in game prompts for key presses are for a controller, regardless of whether or not there is currently one connected. If you're playing on any sort of widescreen monitor, you're going to have issues. The game can handle widescreen just fine - and will occasionally do it on its own for short periods of time - but you need to disable anti-cheat and run some third party software to get it to work consistently. The rest of the time the game slaps black bars over the screen to bring the aspect ratio down to 16:9. Bizarrely, the loading screens will be whatever aspect ratio your screen actually is.The game itself is good. The half assed pc port is not.",0
Negative,"Whoever made the keyboard and mouse control for this game is braindead, such a bad PC port I have no words",0
Negative,"The game is great, but with no ultrawide support and being stuck at 16:9 for an RPG in 2022, I simply cannot give this a positive review. Would change this to a positive in a heartbeat if that were to be updated.",0

Negative,"A network error occured, returning to your world.Also PvP sucks.",0
Negative,You are probably depressed,0
Negative,Man oh man! I was so happy to play from the game play and trailers but the multiplayer just straight up disappoints. This is not true multiplayer so I would not buy this game if you plan on playing with friends. I feel terrible since I talked my friends into buying so we could co-op.,0
Negative,normally i would say don't rate a new game poorly based on performance but this company repeatedly refuses to even try to get the games they release to run well on even high end pc's that have better specs than the console's they are also released on.between the extremely poor mouse and keyboard configuration and the extremely poor performance on pc i am giving this steam version a bad review because poorly running souls games are simply unplayable. if your looking for something to play put this at the bottom of your list and maybe the game will be decent a few months or years down the road,0
Negative,"The UI design for PC is one of the worst PoS in my 20+ years of gaming experience! And the shuttering issues! plus the keyboard input lag, this is truly killing me! How can you even possible to play this kind of game with this kind of controlling and lagging? Thinking of returning it, next path will be my last straw!",0
Negative,"Game does not launch half the time. Sometimes I can play no problem, other times I cant get to the Namco popup before it crashes. No rhyme or reason for the problem. When it does run it runs great until the mobs randomly start turning invisible. The game is hard enough as it is without invisible mobs. Also the game crashes the second I plug in a Xbox One Controller and it will not launch with the controller plugged in. The game is a broken mess.",0

Negative,good game if you hate yourself lol jk its a great game,0
Negative,Actual trash game for not saving my hours of gameplay even when i go to settings and click save and quit,0
Negative,ti thought this game was good until i got a message saying that i had to pick one of 2 options for my saved files when login in this morning only to have 25 levels stripped away from me because neither of the save options were up to date. i had logged 45 hours in this dumb piece of shit game only to have half of it stripped away. fuck steam fuck you and fuck elden ring im getting a refund.,0
Negative,"I genuinely love the world and combat of this game. It feels incredibly immersive and fun to play with and explore in. It is not a 10/10 game though at all. Some of the boss fights in the game feel reused and bank on delayed attacks to trip up on panic rolls. The camera in the game for larger fights is straight up terrible, causing difficulties landing hits and seeing enemy attacks. These issues do not ruin the game at all, and by the end of it I felt quite accomplished and satisfied with my experience of the game. 8.5/10-9/10. Note: Some of my friends still have invisible enemy bugs and it has absolutely ruined their experience of the game, be cautious about this before buying.EDIT:As of the recent patch, I have found myself enjoying the game less and less. While my first playthrough ran well, the most recent patch has caused a ton of frame drops and stutters. This is likely due to EAC. In addition, replaying the game becomes rather frustrating. The map is large, arguably too large, and it causes a great deal of burnout. It doesn't help that even after beating the DLC, I didn't have a ""wow that was great!"" moment, rather ""thank god it is over"". Save your money and look for a game where the devs actually care about their players.",0
Negative,"Amazing game with frustrating technical limitations. If these things really don't bother you, than it's definitely worth buying, otherwise it might be worth waiting. Either way Fromsoft needs to hear this kind of feedback.1. Fix the stuttering.1. Let us increase FOV just a little bit.2. Fix the weird camera movement on mouse and keyboard. The way the camera constantly tries to recenter itself means you're constantly fighting the game for control.The three above probably all contribute to the motion sickness myself and others sometimes feel playing this game. Lastly, and some people might disagree with this, fix menu navigation and item management to actually make sense on a mouse and keyboard. It's ridiculously clunky.",0
Negative,"I have a 10700K and a 3060 12gb. The game is locked to 60 FPS, and there are still performance issues and lowering the rendering resolution does not help. The game it self is very much like the Dark Souls games and is excellent content wise.",0
Negative,"I have played and beaten Dark Souls, Dark Souls 2, Bloodborne, Dark Souls 3, and most of these games are some of my favorite games of all time. Fromsoftware has become one of my favorite developers in the process, and all of their titles since DS1 have been all that I've played for a few years now. And now after completing Elden Ring 3 times on PS4, I'm very sad to say that this game in my opinion has completely missed the mark. Fromsoft really didn't understand why so many people played their previous titles and why they were so adored by many. While the bosses look cool and are super cinematic, that doesn't take away from the fact that their attcks and combos have some of the most annoying telegraphs and windups in the entire series. It feels like all the enemies and bosses' speed were turned up way too high, while they made the PC slower in the process. I can't tell you how many times I've been in a boss fight and have perfectly dodged a 17 hit combo, and as I'm going in to attack (because these games reward you when you properly dodge a bosses attacks by letting you get in a few hits) I get punished and almost die in 1 hit. It feels like they looked at all their previous games and said ""oh we can definitely make this harder"" without understanding why the difficulty was enjoyable in the first place. When I'm fighting a good boss like Gael, it's one of the best fights in video game history because I feel like well yes on the one hand he can absolutely destroy my ass pretty easily, his attacks are well telegraphed and he doesn't have an instant recovery window, meaning I can get attacks in. Elden Ring's bosses are hard for the sake of the company that makes these games being known for having hard boss fights. They aren't executed well and just seem like an afterthought to the open world itself. Speaking on the open world, you know why it doesn't work? New game+. NG+ makes the game exactly what it was trying not to be, a boss rush. While the world itself feels expansive and fantastical, it seriously loses its charm after subsequential playthroughs. Making your game open world when all the previous titles weren't seems like an attempt to profit off of the open world craze that has been rapant throughout the gaming space for years now. It feels like Fromsoft only made it open world is because it'd make them even more money than just making a regular linear game like usual, they wanted to make the game widely consumed while also cranking the damage scaling and enemy speed way the fuck up. It scares me to think about the direction this company that I have loved for a long time is going in, because of Elden Ring's success. Also don't even get me started on all the duo fights, ulcerated tree spirits, revenants, and fucking Malenia. This game can suck my ass 5/10 (also I can't even open the game anymore cause it crashes every time I try to enter Stormveil, and on my new character I can't teleport anywhere out of dragonbarrow without it crashing again, fuck you Elden Ring)",0
Negative,i bought this because i hate myselfedit: i cant stop not playing,0
Negative,"Game map wouldnt even load, game sucks 1* for this tragic piece of shit",0
Negative,i suck at it so its bad,0
Negative,Game has terrible mouse & keyboard support. Set to full screen yet will randomly put your mouse on 2nd monitor mid boss fight. Died at least a dozen times to this.,0
Negative,"It's just very bland compared to the other RPGs that they've made. The exploration isn't very fun and most of the necessary items (upgrade materials, keys) are scattered around boring copy-pasted locations.The game is really fun with mods and in seamless co-op, but as a standalone game, I do not enjoy it.",0
Negative,"Along with performance issues, game benefits little from being open world. Game also deleted around 4-5 hours of progress along with 10 of my levels after a crash and I hard to restart 2 bosses back. Funniest part about this is that despite having the achievement for defeating these bosses, I will still have to fight them again. Can't recommend this game to anyone. It's overly punishing, unfair many times, and even when you're doing well you're one performance issue/crash away from losing a little to lots of progress. Spend your time and money on something better.",0
Negative,"This game is great, I love souls like games but the technical issues are horrid, I have everything on my pc updated, I worked for a few hours to optimize it and fix the many, many issues I had, I wish it had a bit more leaning room on what you need to run this game.",0
Negative,"game is too laggy to even start. Yesterday it was crashing every 5-10 minutes, now I have 3 fps on start and cannot do anything. I have tried every technique said, and nothing worked.

Negative,"Anti Cheat copulates the performance, the ""no no"" version runs a million times better and I finished it. Decided to purchase it then bam, runs like bad words",0
Negative,At first it was fantastic now in the open world it's borderline unplayable. I'm running a 3080 on i9-10900K and 32GB Ram. I'm getting Constant stuttering and freezes. Died more than a handful of times on bosses where the game just freezes up. I'd get it on console or wait for a patch until purchasing. Shame cos it's a fantastic game just hindered massively by it's performance issues.,0
Negative,"Why the thumbs down?PC ports are usually a little tough, not super consumer friendly, and need some tweaking out of the box.Unfortunately, somethings can't be fixed with settings tweaks. Lacking 21:9 support in 2022 is absurd, and needing to use a 3rd party program to mess with the FOV, forcing you to play offline because of anti-cheats, is not an acceptable solution.I have a 3070ti, a 9th-gen i7, and 32g of RAM and I have been experiencing stuttering, frame drops, crashes, etc. I'd recommend picking the game up on console before PC (until the port is more stable and supports more monitor configurations), especially if you have a 20xx or older GPU.If they fix the above issues (stuttering, framedrops, ultrawide support), I'll change my rating from a ""No"" to a ""Yes"" but with a few caveats.As a vet soulsborne player, Dark Souls 4 with a jump button is basically more of the same FromSoft style. The world is both hollow yet expansive, the animations and models are both outdated and fresh, and the game's progression is straight-forward and linear while giving the player the illusion of choice. It's hard to look past the gamification of the mechanics, especially when they are deliberately designed to waste your time to pad the length of the game.The game itself is not as hard as some other games in FromSoft's catalog, but it's also not quite as fun or immersive. I'd say the game was designed to appeal to a broader audience than the souls games, but fails at evolving the ubisoft open-world formula to anything remarkable. If you have played Breath of the Wild or Valheim in recent years, you will see their mark on Elden Ring, and find yourself wanting for the elegance of simplicity that is Valheim or the heart and soul that inhabits Hyrule's equally empty and expansive world.I wanted to like Elden Ring, I wanted to play a game with the world Miyazaki intended delivered in a more narrative style, like Sekiro, rather than combing through wiki's and watching hours of Vaati to understand my character's basic motivations. Unfortunately, it seems that the only influence GRRM seems to have had on Elden Ring is the frequent and long delays in getting the game to shelves. It's pretty clear to me that the combat, animations, models, and world is almost entirely lifted from other FromSoft titles. You'll see Bloodborne's hair physics on the dogs, attack and character animations from Dark Souls, and world textures and models from Sekiro, Dark Souls 3, and Bloodborne.If you are a fan of Dark Souls/Demon's Souls/Bloodborne/Sekiro and you want just more of that, this game is perfect. It probably beats playing Dark Souls again for the 1,000th time. Just, don't look at the 97/100 metacritic reviews and expect to be blown away by some revolutionary game.It's fine, just, fine.7/10",0
Negative,"Well after almost 6 hours troubleshooting the game and even more hours figuring stuff out in settings the game still stutters like crazy going down to 0 fps sometimes, gotta disconnect everything from my computer for it to recognize my xbox controller so all in all i have actually played Elden Ring For like an hour and a half but steam wont refund the game because Im past the 2 hour marked for refunds. GG, heavy reminder of why i hadn't bought a game on launch or a very long time",0
Negative,"This game seems like it would be so much fun, but it is completely unplayable right now because all the enemies are invisible unless standing directly on top of them. I actually thought the invisibility was feature of the game at first but after getting ganked continuously by invisible creatures, I realized that they shouldn't be invisible. Who knew! I've tried all the fixes and still no luck. I want to enjoy the multiplayer option with friends too but we get disconnected from each others worlds constantly. The lag is real regardless of settings in game and on my PC. So disappointing, but if they fix these issues I would definitely give this game another shot. I would not recommend this game on PC right now. I think console is a safer bet for now until the PC performance issues are resolved.",0
Negative,"First off, I love this game. With the exception of Bloodborne it has been my favorite FromSoft game so far, and I'm barely halfway through. But the random crashes are really killing my motivation to play. It runs great 95% of the time even on my low end PC, but in certain situations even without dropped frames it crashes consistently. I hope that FromSoft will fix these issues so everyone can enjoy this great game they made.",0
Negative,"Just an absolutely terrible, terrible PC port. Can't map mouse buttons? Hard-coded menu buttons? FPS limits? WHY? I'm old, set in my ways. I need to map mouse buttons or a game is a no-go for me. I'm sorry I pre-ordered this game.Well, I've used the Logitech software to remap mouse buttons to what they are hard-coded to. I don't understand the appeal of this game, and I think part of the problem is that I'm using a kb/mouse and not a controller. Sorry, if you're a computer person this game won't cut it.",0

Negative,"Great game! A world you can lose yourself into. It took me 20 hrs of exploring the world before I decided to actually progress the story and kill Margit, the fell omen.However, there are glaring issues. 1)For example, the stuttering issue. it was worse on launch. It still stutters but its less now. 2)Coop. Ever since bloodborne, my friend and i have been playing coop. In bloodborne it was very hard to summon him, while in dark souls 3 we get disconnected(not often but enough to annoy us). Here, in elden ring, it is frustrating due to the fact that there are constant disconnections. Did i mention the game crashes sometimes in the middle of summoning a phantom? Cause it does. Also the bloodstains doesn't work most of the times.Fix your game miyazaki or i'll be forced to invade you and try finger but hole.",0
Negative,"Amazing gameplay with new mechanics. Beautiful world. Great enemy design and fun bosses. Huge fan of all Souls and Sekiro. Originally loved the game and was going to put thumbs up until you begin to see st how the flaws affect the game.Very overall game design choices:- A copy of Dark Souls stories- Forgettable NPCs- Useless crafting list- Poor keyboard controls (which of course must be configured)- Easy Anti Cheat making the PC version run worse than the console, regardless of your build- Same dark souls spellsAnd then there's multiplayer, which worked for Dark Souls but is outdated and feels more tedious:- Direct copy of Dark Souls multiplayer - craft a very easy crafting item so you can summon players, so now you really see how tedious loading screens are after killing a boss or dying. If you want to play with friends, there will be a lot of waiting and loading screens.- Frequent disconnects- Max coop party of 3, when 4 is a very typical party group size- Can't summon players in the ""open world"" section if you've beaten a certain boss in the area, which is unknown who that is- Can't use horse when in coop or invasions, a necessity in a lot of areas due to lakes of poison, so you now have to walk miles on foot if you're with friends, making the game and picking up crafting items slower- If playing with friends, you have to clear the area on every person's world",0

Little black squares pop up all around my screen along with the game freezing and getting nothing above 10 fps. Ive refunded and re-purchased the game, uninstalled and reinstalled about 4 times now. I dont understand how or why this is happening. My pc has had zero issues running any other large game in the past, especially this poorly. If anybody can help me, please PM me. Or feel free to add my discord; bwuh #9229Thank you.",0
Negative,"I was excited to get into Elden Ring and I was promptly disappointed. The first thing I noticed was the quality of the console port to PC. This is obvious right at the first menu as soon as the game is launched. It is clunky and does not show you what buttons you need to press to navigate through the menus, and mouse clicks do not work for some things. You have to go through trial and error to figure out how to navigate the menus.After figuring out the menus on PC, I cranked up all the graphics settings I could find to max and set the game to 4K resolution. I noticed in game that the quality at the very start area did not look as good as I was expecting. This was not a big deal, just worth mentioning I was a little thrown off at the graphic quality I saw off the bat.I then experienced some minor stuttering and immediately checked my FPS, which I noticed was capped at 60 and holding on my 6800 XT/5950X. I then thought V-SYNC must be on, but after searching the terrible menus, there is no V-Sync setting.After these immediate observations I was already feeling just a bit bummed, then I noticed everything in the game to interact with was asking me to press Y. Again, like the menus you have to by trial and error start pressing keyboard keys to figure out how to play the game. I then went back into the menus again, I had to find the keybindings page and try to remember some of the keybinds since the game was only showing Xbox controller buttons on a PC version of the game.Still trying to get into the game I decided to get a PS4 controller out. My thought process was that since this is clearly a bad PC port, maybe I would be better off getting into the game with a controller over KB/Mouse. This is when I found out I could not get the controller to work in the game either. I tried a few fixes I read on the web with no luck, but I am surely not the only one with this problem either.I hope FromSoftware gets this squared away quickly, because I do want to play and enjoy the game.This PC issue is not excusable for a premium title like this. Just because you can patch a game later doesn't mean you need to release a game this poorly done on PC and expect a premium price tag for it.",0
Negative,"rtx 2070 super + ryzen 3600I have played every fromsoft game except for armored core, favorites being sekiro and bloodborne. This game on pc is borderline unplayable for me, with constant frame drops and stutters in limegrave, especially with the open field bosses. Tried all the fixes out there, and changed the graphic settings, updated drivers, etc. I am playing it on ps5 instead because of how bad it runs. I do not recommend buying this game at this state, anyone telling you its completely fine is either an idiot who cant tell what is stable 60fps or just a lying shill, same types of people that said they dont mind powerpresentation-like fps in bloodborne. If you are not sensitive to choppy fps drops, then buy it because the game is good, if you are, do not. None of the fixes will 100% work, see this video it clears everything up",0

Negative,"A lot of performance issues despite hardware being well above the recommended specs:Framerate drops, stuttering, slowdowns, crashing.Specs: RTX 3080, i5-10700, 32GB RAM, M.2 SSDAlso encountered some bugs, like dying when using the mount (summoning it made it run away while I was stuck in place in the riding animation for 20 seconds, then died).In terms of the actual game's content, gameplay is similar to Dark Souls 3, with some additions and improvements. Magic is a lot more viable, and enemy design is more varied. Though with so many more enemies and bosses, individual boss design seems to have suffered, as most have minor to major design flaws, and aren't nearly as well designed as bosses from previous Souls games. This makes combat quite frustrating, and bosses are one of the most interesting aspects of games like this.The overworld is designed well, exploration is a lot of fun, and the smaller dungeons offer a nice change of pace. The bigger main dungeons give a more curated experience, more akin to previous Dark Souls games.Overall, if it ran well, I'd give the game itself a 7/10, but can't currently recommend it with the performance issues.",0

Negative,"This game is unfortunately broken for the computer release. The game constantly stutters and runs into frame rate issues which prompts players to try to find makeshift solutions, leading them on a wild goose chase which can make the problems worse. One such example being mine where after my venture of following the advice of those who could get the game to work, the game instead decided that it would cause the screen to be a void unless I looked straight down which would cause light to grace the computer screen once again. Most likely a decent game but buying it is an unpredictable guess of whether or not it works for you.",0

A lot of the issues allegedly come from random RAM usage spikes, so if you have more than 16 gigs ram and the min reccommended you should be fine:tm: but it's still inexcusable how bad this port runs.EDIT NOV 11 2022: DUDE HOW DO THEY KEEP MAKING IT RUN LIKE SHIT, EVERY UPDATE IT JUST GOT WORSE LMAO, I'VE UPGRADED MY WHOLE PC AND IT STILL DOESN'T WORK. ACTUAL JOKE OF A PORT",0

Negative,This game needs some serious fixes. Not saying it's completely unplayable but so far I've faced MANY crashes in the middle of the game and not to mention the fps drops. Hotfix when?! I WAS NEARLY KILLING A BOSS AND GAME LAGS WHEN HES 1 HP,0
Negative,"In the 30 hours that it took me to beat Elden Ring, I was put through an absolute wringer of emotion: Anger as I was beaten down by its toughest challenges, exhilaration when I finally overcame them, and a fair amount of sorrow for the mountains of exp I lost along the way to some of the toughest boss encounters FromSoftware has ever conceived. But more than anything else I was in near-constant awe from the many absolutely jaw-dropping vistas, the sheer scope of an absolutely enormous world, the frequently harrowing enemies, and the way in which Elden Ring nearly always rewarded my curiosity with either an interesting encounter, a valuable reward, or something even greater. FromSoftware takes the ball that The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild got rolling and runs with it, creating a fascinating and dense open world about freedom and exploration above all else, while also somehow managing to seamlessly weave a full-on Dark Souls game into the middle of it. It shouldn t be a surprise to anyone that Elden Ring ended up as one of the most unforgettable gaming experiences I ve ever had.",0
Negative,"This game has been fantastic, full of content and the culmination of FROMSOFT design. HOWEVER. We can't ignore the sutteRING that has been happening and I am no stranger. The occasional drop here or there but right now it's inexcusable. My fps has tanked following the server refresh 2-28/3-01 and that is absolutely ridiculous. The game I'm playing shouldn't get worse as I'm playing it. I want this game to be great because it has the potential to be so, but not with this performance.EDIT 04/04 124 Hours - Game crashed twice today, the second time I had a boss one hit. When I booted the game up it put me outside of the fog gate with the boss back at full health and the consumables I used the previous fight remaining used.EDIT 06/16 It's better now.EDIT 01/04 FPS is bad again, crashed on me three times today",0
Negative,"Runs solid on my pc but I have a pretty top end rig, the tiny bit of lag here and there never bothered me. Also, I can absolutely see why some one would love this game. All the open world stuff I like is here.But the game was just tedious and frustrating. I wanted to like it, I'm not familar with the souls games but a friend who is prepped me to expect to die a lot, so I was ready for that. But spending hours redoing the same long difficult section over and over went from tedious to frustrating to eventually my just not wanting to play anymore. Again, I get why some one might like this, having significant punishments probably increases the satisifcation when you do get through a tough section for some people, but for me, even when I did finally get through all I felt was relief and a realization I hadn't been having fun and was glad to not be ""playing"" that section anymore. All of these things are red flags that a game isn't for me. I play games to have fun, and I just didn't find this game fun. Maybe you will, and if you already bought it, I hope you do, but I can't recommend it based on my own experience.",0
Negative,"Elden Ring is a nightmare.No. Not because it's ""hard""Because it's amateur game design and finding ways around asinine or beginner-level implementation is irritating, and those inexperienced with how games are made confuse this as some type of intentional difficulty level.Take something basic like the character creator. The Facial morphs have the Jaw setting affecting your eyes.There is literally no reason why this should happen, even MARIO 64 got it right and they manually coded vertex extent floats.Elden Ring on the other hand. whether you like it or not, feels outsourced to competent, experienced game devs one moment while the next it seems more like someone missed a few steps on a youtube tutorial.The Multiplayer implementation lacks any flair of a hex-edited/injected third party mutliplayer multiplayer mod while making the system into a pain in the ass series of hoops to jump though only so your immersion breaking glow-character can maybe tag along for 5 minutes if you don't move from your safe spot before kicking you out and making you start over due to server issues or random deaths or simply hey the game crashed again.The visual design of the game itself seems about as indy as it can get, having brilliant terrain-gen open world levels coupled with skies that look copied from google to secondlife.The Monster Ai is like something out of 1999's pristontale and offers nothing, with theoretical ""absurd difficulty"" only meaning that everything is likely to kill you rather than actually outsmart you or force you to grow.The play control isn't actually that bad. Much better on a controller, but why are there 4 different attacks? Reminds me of Bushido Blade where square started the first with 3 attacks and dumbed it down to 2 which were used more sparingly, and depending on timing for different purposes.I've attempted to find actual ""mechanical"" need for all of this, but hack and slash seems to garner the most likely kills with some attacks simply expending your time.I can't speak on the story other than that it takes about 30 seconds for the narrator to say a single word, and the characters sound so disconnected from reality that it's almost nails on a chalk board to listen to them. But some may like this, mostly foreigners who aren't very good at English and concentrate more on vowels than on actual sentence structure.I'll update this when I'm farther into the game. If I ever leave this immediate starter area.Edit:Um. Same as before. I wish I could refund this game. There's some potential, but it's mostly just annoying, especially the poor multiplayer implementation.My suggestion is to simplify it. Connect to a friend's world as yourself, not some BS Ghost, run around that world with a friend, when you die DO NOT Disconnect us, let us continue screwing around together, and for gods sake don't make us buy items to do this shit that's fucking annoying.",0
Negative,"Extremely poor performance issues. Returning the game until this is patched. Play on a console if you have one. My 3080ti should not be dipping this frequently on ""high"" performance.Also why does it default to an xbox controller when I bought this on a PC? Finally found the setting in sound and display, but still. Lame.",0
Negative,"Fantastic game, stunning visuals, wayyy too many technical problems.The Good:- Elden Ring is a magnificent game with great mechanics and rewarding combat. I've always been a fan of FromSoftware and the Souls-bourne games for these components.- This time around, we even get a double-jumping horse mount and a vast open world. I love the innovation, and the mount controls very well.- The graphics are stunning from the enemy textures to the moment you open to that magnificent Limgrave scene with massive castles far off in the distance. It may not be the best graphics of the year, but it does exceptionally well nonetheless.The Bad:- None. I have not gotten very far into the game before requesting a refund (due to the issues below). For the amount that I played, there were no real complaints regarding the world or mechanics. I loved playing for the moments that I could.The Ugly:That said, I really cannot recommend the game in its current state. Some people have had positive experiences without problem, and I am very excited for them. For the rest of us, there are some major issues.- Stuttering and FPS dropping. These are independent of graphics card or setup and supposedly have more to do with poor optimization and the anti-cheat. Even streamers with current and very expensive rigs are having these issues.- Locked 60 FPS with no ability to lock it lower.- No ultrawide support.FromSoftware has given an apology and statement about the performance on PC. So it has been officially recognized. I also commend FromSoftware for patching a couple launch issues quickly, namely the mouse sensitivity and anti-cheat launch error. However, much more work is required. There are stutter ""fixes"" circulating the internet, but most of them aren't reliable at all. So hopefully we do get some big patches and improvements in the very near future. I have no doubt that it will be a magnificent journey once that happens.I do plan to update this review (and most likely recommend) once the game is in an acceptable, more stable state.",0

Negative,"Game is niceMultiple fps drops, constant connection errors are notWhen they will fix this I may change the review, but still fck FS for making us pay full price and beta test performance and anti cheat systemEDIT================Game is not nice. imo it's the worst FS title I've ever played (all games since DkS1). The story is meh, open world seems nice at first, but breaks coop with friends and totally kills level design and there is visible downgrade in almost every other aspect. Broken animations, hitboxes, frames not working properly, shallow pvp design, makes it feel super inferior to prior FS games. Yet another problem is that elden ring tries to be different from dark souls, but at the same time it's like 80% rip off from souls universe. Really, there are so many issues with this game almost a month after release, that I regret paying full price and wish I kept playing ""free"" version instead.Is there anything good? Yes, of course, some locations are nice, graphics are typical FS game, so not bad. combat is theoretically nice, but due to bugs, lags and improper hitboxes and animation issues the joy is lost somewhere in the process. In conclusion, I don't recommend buying this game now. Not for from software veterans nor new players who want to join the hypetrain. Wait till you get 50% off and then you can give it a shot, considering it would get more patches until then. I'd say that after fixing connectivity issues and improving hitboxes the game would be solid 6/10",0
Negative,"Refunding due to the issue with streaming in assets. The game has issues streaming in new assets and will stutter terribly when doing so.PC players shouldn't support nor tolerate such a low quality port.Video example/explanation(@6:35): EDIT: Gave it another go just over a month from launch, and while there has been slight progress the frame-skipping is still terrible.Going in for a 2nd refund lol2 years and a whole pc later and the game runs.

I have an RTX 3090 so my PC isn't the problem; also I have great internet connection.A previous commentator said he couldn't believe From Software would release its Magnum Opus on such a state on PC. I couldn't agree more. I will change my review once the game is fixed.EDIT 12-03-2022:-Refunded and purchased for PS4.",0
Negative,"I played Bloodborne about 6 or 7 times total, not including Chalices. I start by saying that that I'm definitively not a framerate snob. Bloodborne is stucked on the PS4, meaning that you cannot have better hardware than the PS4 (mine isn't Pro), and so the performance is limited. I still played throught it again and again, because it was still playable.Elden Ring, at this moment, isn't.The stutter is real. I knew all of the general comments : -Open world is a pain for the stuttering.-Framerates keep dropping-Some were even getting carsick of it.And I can confirm all of those 3 myself, even the carsick one. And even in the inside areas, like the VERY STARTING ROOM, there was lots of stutter. For god sake, even on the reanimating animation, the one right after a death (so one you'll probably have the luxury to see again and again) that's where the stuttering was the worst.I will now be refunding the game. Maybe Fromsoft will optimize this bad port one day, maybe not. I will gladly buy it when it's actually going to be worth 80 $.Until then, cross fingers you don't get problems, or do the same thing as you were doing since it was announce : wait. Because the game and it's beauty aren't respected enough with playing through a fucking clipshow.Elden Ring deserve better than this shitty port. The developpers making it since years deserve better than this. It's sad when Dark Souls Remastered actually does something better than a brand new game.It's almost like the game wasn't ready.",0
Negative,The multiplayer disconnects are absolutely ridiculous. Fix and thumbs up.,0
Negative,"I'll start by saying what Elden Ring does right: it's a beautiful and atmospheric game.Right. Now on to the rest of it: do you see that knight bowed on the Elden Ring banner art, battered and brought low by the relentless horror of a brutal existence? That's going to be you.And contrary to what you may think, it's not because the game is particularly difficult - at least not in any conventional understanding of the word. Beating its foes does not require a deep think or a flawless execution; rather, it requires you to find out where the developers hid the ball. Upgrades? Hidden without rhyme or reason. Key items? Located in arbitrary holes on the other side of a dangerous zone. Critical NPCs? Better hope you wander into them while you're lost as fuck.This is a game devoid of joy, one which substitutes misery for storytelling and sheer, numbing exertion for gameplay. Before you say, maybe this game isn't for me: I loved Souls. I loved Sekiro. Elden Ring is Souls as remade by Disney, with all of its intriguing mystery replaced by (very pretty) void. This game is a catastrophic failure of imagination, less a new game than a pale imitation of what came before. There is nothing new or innovative here, nor does it capture any of the original's spirit.For me, Elden Ring is absolutely prototypical of entertainment's current trend: remake an old favorite and hope nostalgia papers over its numerous flaws. Much like Star Wars XXIV: You Still Like Lightsabers Right?, this game feels as dead as a corporate executive's soul.That being said, if you enjoy playing your video games with a comprehensive wiki open on another screen, you may squeeze some fun out of this when it goes on a deep sale. The controls are tight and the build options are varied and unique. You won't find a story hidden under any of it, but there's a pretty fantasy combat simulator waiting to be explored. There could have been a great game here, if the developers had been allowed - or tried - to push the genre and introduce new ideas.Like Dark Souls' undead protagonists, Elden Ring shambles along - but it is cold inside, and no campfire can warm a heart which doesn't beat.",0
Negative,"forced vsync, 60 fps lock and forcing 60hz refresh rate sure is disgusting",0
Negative,"I'm enjoying this game, but BOY does it need to be optimized. I fought the first boss and there were constant frame stutters, and in a game where one wrong move can be fatal, that is NOT a good thing. The game also doesn't close for me when I press quit? It just suspends itself. I had to close it manually by ending the process in Task Manager. As of right now, I can't recommend this game.",0
Negative,"The game content is quite incredible and as a Dark Souls fan, I can see that the recipes that made the series so notorious have been implemented as well as improved in Elden Ring. However this PC port is a nightmare in terms of performance. Even with the recommended settings that you can find all over the internet mitigating the performance issues, those are still happening nonetheless. Stuttering and random crashes are a real struggle which will make you loose your progression. I had two crashes in less than 15 minutes today. It's so frustrating when you lose your souls or the game crashes during a boss battle. All the positive things about the game content is being overshadowed by those performance issues. The more I am playing the game the more I am actually wondering whether I should wait for those issues to be fixed which I strongly believe will give me a way better experience overall. As of right now I would recommend anyone to be patient and wait for patches tackling performance issues to be released.",0
Negative,"Played for about a half of an hour. I never was a fan of soul's like game and Elden ring seemed cool enough design-wise to try.I bought it. I started to play it and I was in awe of how average it looked visually (for a 2020+ year game) and how bad port to PC actually is. I had literal nausea from camera (I compared, camera motion with joystick on other platforms are much more smoother and flow of the motion isn't jerky as it is on PC with mouse). So I refunded my game and refunded a game which I bought to my bf. My game was refunded but my gift wasn't for some reason, it's still on hold/review.This game is truly for Dark souls's like fans. I can't stand these very hard and heavy animations and design choices of prolonging actions. I'm more wow/dmc kind of guy, where you can rotate your character instantly when you want it and all actions are instantly canceled as well. So this game also wasn't made for me. But either way what stopped me to play it was camera jerkiness only cause I physically couldn't look at the monitor while I was running.Also was really demoralized that this game was so designless in terms of main characters. They are just regular humans. I thought that this long arm-lady is the regular anatomy of this game but nope. She just one of the ""boss"" type of creatures which you take against here. Also also models, VFX and textures looks unpleasing as well, it's like a port of a game from 2010. I can't recommend this game, but if there was ""meh"" option I would tick it. Cause I can't NOT recommend this game from my perspective of bad vestibular apparatus and personal views on visuals. Hard core gamers with joysticks will find here tons of fun (as they are right now)",0
Negative,"Exceptional game, but the performance on the PC edition is abysmal. Would wait to see if a patch is deployed that rectifies these issue. Unfortunately, in the games current state, the performance issues massively affect immersion and fluidity, and stuttering causes a few unwanted deaths.",0
Negative,"I did enjoy the game, but.The game needs severe end game balancing updates. It sucks the fun out of your experience when you're there (post Altus Plateau regions). Plus, the bosses in this game aren't fun. They just keep on attacking and attacking and delayed attacking. Honestly, they also suck the fun out of the game. The questing system is obsolete.Also believe, the game would've benefited from a smaller game world. I got really burnt out towards the end of the game. I had similar experience with Dark Souls I after finishing Anor Londo. I kind of lost motivation to proceed further. It seemed more like a chore than actual fun.Negative review till I see some proper updates regarding the balancing.",0
Negative,"I enjoy the game, but the lack of proper pc support for this port is atrocious.-No dedicated graphic support to turn off/on things the user wants (looking at you chromatic aberration)-Locked frame rates -Lack of ultrawide support-Lack of customizable key support for keyboard (and what is there is beyond basic)-General lack of being able to turn some features on and off (the terrible camera head bobbing for one)God Of War set a standard for what a proper PC port should look like, and this falls so far off it hurts. I want to play this game more, but I feel like I can't actually immerse myself into it without having to install and manage several third party options just to be able to change things that should be a standard for a pc game releasing in 2022.If things actually improve then I will revisit this, but for now if you plan on playing on pc avoid and wait.",0

Negative,"In its current state I cannot recommend Elden Ring if you have any desire to play multiplayer. Connection issues on week 1 aside, the way the multiplayer is designed is clunky at best. In an ideal world there would be a way to let you explore the game with a couple friends. The game outright prevents this by severely limiting the capabilities of the party members while cooperating.1. Mounts cannot be summoned2. Grace points (save / teleport locations) cannot interacted with preventing further exploration of discovered areas3. New Grace points cannot be interacted with preventing the party from discovering new areas together4. Potions for the non-host members are halved5. All summon skills are unavailable6. Chests are only lootable by the hostThe intention is to let you grab a friend to fight maybe a single boss, but unfortunately the game feels really bad here too. The way the bosses are designed, unless you are god's gift to gaming, you will die to the bosses multiple times. The time between attempts is greatly increased when trying to cooperate, slowing the party's progress to a crawl. Some of the mechanics that contribute to the friction are:1. The party is completely disbanded when the host dies2. The death of any guest removes them from the party3. The party must beat the boss once for each person since only the host gets credit for the boss.4. The core combat mechanics are very timing sensitive. The current lagginess of the connection makes executing these tight mechanics unreliable.5. You can only summon 1 person at a time and must wait until the person has fully loaded into the game until you can summon the next member. The total time to reassemble your party for each try means the time to retry the boss goes from seconds in the single play experience to minutes in the multiplayer experience.Even if the connection and performance issues are ultimately addressed the mechanics of multiplayer will prevent it from being a viable experience. I understand that some of these systems are inherited from the previous Souls games, but for those new to the Souls franchise know what you are walking into. I think, legacy or not, these mechanics are hostile to the multiplayer experience.",0
Negative,"ah yes, time to play as John ""Elden"" Ring, famous for his quote ""Every ring has its elden""for the love of god please let me buy the soundtrack without having to blow 80 bucks on the deluxe edition, or atleast give me an option to upgrade my game to the deluxe for 20 bucksalso fuck the elden beast",0
Negative,This game is awful. I have not idea how this plays on console but if it is anything like it is a on pc its garbage there too. First thing off the bat I got stuck in the system menu because everything is setup for controller. No information at all on how to exit the system settings once you are in there. Had to watch a video online explaining how to do it. It is a terrible port. All the game play is the same way. Just hitting every button to figure out what they do because the tutorial just shows controller options. So hop back in settings to look up keybindings and struggle back out of them with the terrible mouse navigation. Don't buy this. At least not right now. Wait a year and hope it goes on sale. Don't give these publishers money for unfinished games.,0
Negative,"I wouldn't recommend the game right now. I have had five game breaking crashes in three hours. I still run into the game crashing to exit less than an hour into playing most times.Guys, this is killing the immersion and the game for me. Just as I get back into it, the game fucking crashes. It's like watching one of the greatest classic movies but at 2 frames per second with the moving just blacking out and starting over constantly.Great, if your system is working, but I have a 2080 ti, with a Ryzen 3950x, and this shit is absolutely fucked.EDIT: 6 hours more hours in, still having game breaking bugs. Considered getting a fucking xbox series S just to play this fucking game.Fucking hell.",0
Negative,"As a newcomer to these kinds of titles but longtime RPG enthusiast, I wanted to like Elden Ring and give it a chance, but so far it's a mixed bag for me. It wasn't a terrible experience; a lot of positives come through. The game is beautiful, the world and exploration felt immersive, and the enemy/art design is solid. The RPG flavor and customization feels good. Where it's falling short for me is, despite a powerful machine, the performance is indeed inconsistent. Stuttering frames are common. Also, the gameplay (I understand it's a ""souls"" game) is brutal. The combat feels like the game truly hates the player, with gamey boss mechanics, difficult reaction speed challenges, and very little margin to learn before being punished. When that aligns with the frame drops and stutters and you lose all the xp you'd been holding, it makes for a very frustrating experience. The game makes little effort, if any, to instruct mechanics, keybinds, or features; Most of what I figured out required some google assistance. I appreciate the skills and persistence required to get through these kinds of games, and l do think if you enjoyed the other souls titles you'll probably enjoy this as well. As a new entry point in the genre though, I just didn't find pleasure in the gameplay pain and it wasn't fun for me.",0

Negative,"I didn't even make it out of the character creator. The menu is confusing and not set up to be use with mouse and keyboard efficiently. A friend loaded in and barely had 15 fps on low. It is a very disappointing first impression of the series. I really wanted to give it the benefit of a doubt, but it is unplayable in it's current state. The game is not optimized for the pc version as is.",0
Negative,"Honestly, when I first bought the game on release, immediate thumbs up in the first 7 hours. Beautiful open world, interesting enemies and world gen and epic dungeons, wide variety of play-styles. Or so I thought?. Get ready for a 100+ hour journey of meaningless open worlds with copy pasted assets everywhere, 9 unique bosses and over 100+ of the same pointless mini bosses pasted everywhere at random. unique and varied play styles in the air? Wrong! rivers of blood mimic tear bleed build forced down your throat because apparently massive hulking 500 pound great-swords at +10 cant even one shot basic enemies and you are forced to just spam jump attack and die in 2 hits with the heaviest, strongest armor in the game, even with the Berserk references everywhere, its a joke of a tribute. The positive reviews are catered to the soy anime addicted losers that only use katanas. The open world is even more of a joke after being already pointless as you can't even play coop to explore the hollow world together with your friends, instead you have to install 3rd party mods to make the game a smidgen better. Locked at sub 60 fps so your GPU can generate the mesmerizing portrait of the copy and pasted empty meaningless open world in your face at all times. The game's main story line and lore makes little sense and could be fit into a sticky note. Weapon choice is as meaningless as it is vast. The majority of the weapons are useless in comparison to katanas. Straight swords are basically useless, they are outclasses by the starter uchigatana in every aspect, range, damage, speed, ashes, and bleed. You are also forced to be married to your weapon, not being improved at all after DS3; you either have a reliable +25 weapon or a bunch of trashy sub +10 weapons that deal little damage. The PVP is the worst in all of fromsoftware games. I had to quit my 2nd playthrough after getting to Leyendell and fighting an evergoal- its literally Godrick with one letter of the name changed. The final boss of the game had me yawning, it's 100x more tedious than it is difficult. run to one side of the map, deal a teensy bit of damage before it burrows 5 kilometres away to the other side where you are forced to run after it. All in all, one of the worst fromsoftware games, really ruining my image of them after playing Sekiro (My personal favorite) and DS3. TL;DR pointless hollow open world, copy pasted bosses and enemies, forced bleed/mage spam gameplay; forced to use one weapon, incredibly dumb and confusing lore/story that fits onto a notepad in length.",0
Negative,"This game represents a very poor port to PC. The company has done no work to make the game accessible using a keyboard, without even bothering to remap the binding display. It's disappoint as I was excited to play, but between the screen taring, poor menu navigation, and poor UI/UX, can't recommend at this time.",0
Negative,"Absolutely NOT! In addition, give serious thought as to whether Steam should be getting your business.Despite misgivings due to the involvement of the author who can't be bothered to finish his work, I decided to give this game a shot-and I'm now stuck with it because I tried too hard to give it a fair shake. Let me explain. Steam has a 2-hours of playtime limit to get a refund-fair 'nough. True, I didn't look that up beforehand but at the same time, Steam chose to send me a canned message instead of looking at what happened.so screw you, Steam, as well.Elden Ring is obviously built to be played with a controller and the interface is NOT friendly at all to keyboard/mouse play. I figured that would not be a problem since I have a controller that I've used on several other games (Halo's Master Chief Collection being the most notable and recent). I get the game, load it up, and start playing-controller doesn't work in game. Switched out controllers; switched out cables; left the game and confirmed controller works fine in Halo:MCC. Controller works in Steam; it works out of Steam; it works everywhere EXCEPT in Elden Ring. So the problem must be in Elden Ring settings.I spent almost THREE HOURS troubleshooting and looking up information on what the deal is with controllers and PCs and this game. I finally decided to just try it to get an idea of the game play on keyboard/mouse and found it as frustrating as might be expected. At that point, game play time was at right about 4 hours but almost 3 hours of that was trying to make the game (and Steam) work properly.So, lesson learned. Don't try to troubleshoot anything from Steam ever again-if it doesn't work perfectly right away, sent the SOB right back to the electron pushers on the corner of Steam Ave and Greed Blvd for a refund. It doesn't pay to try to do the right thing.One more time: Screw you, Steam!(Steam-If an actual PERSON sees this and wants to make it right, please just do so. I have absolutely ZERO urge or intent to ""talk about it."" I WILL at an update to this review, but I won't take it down-You EARNED this bit of discomfort.)",0
Negative,"PVE is great like the previous games, BUT the Multiplayer is worse than the previous games. Especially the PVP. There is only a 4 player limit instead of 6 players like DS3 had. Can't get invaded when playing solo unless you use the Taunter's Tongue item, which also allows us to turn it off whenever we want for some reason. Can only be invaded by 2 players if the Taunters Tongue is used, which makes large group fights not really a thing in this game. Fight clubs are no longer a thing. 2v4 and 3v3 invasions don't exist anymore. It is very disappointing, for someone who really enjoys the multiplayer in these games. The balance issues are of course a constant problem, but honestly its these core changes to the multiplayer that Elden Ring made that really is the biggest problem. Bring back organic invasions where you could be invaded by 2 players without needing to use the taunter's tongue. Bring back the option to be invaded organically when playing solo (maybe if I have a rune arc activated). Bring back the 6 player limit. Make it so that if the Taunters tongue is active, we can be invaded by 3 invaders (if a slot is open for a 3rd). Make it so that we cannot turn off the Taunters Tongue unless we die, kill a boss, enter a boss fog wall, or are the only player left in our world. Bring back fight clubs. The game is still awesome in my opinion, PVE wise, but it is crazy to me that the multiplayer of a game that was made 8 years ago by the same studio is somehow better than this one's.",0

Negative,"One of the best games I've ever played in my life.Unfortunately, the performance is lacking and I've crashed randomly 8 times in my 38 hrs of playing. I have a high end computer which well exceeds the recommended requirements. It's a shame that it was released in this state, the fun I'm having is being soured the more I play and the more I crash.",0
Negative,"i cant even play the game. a brotha was really hyped for this game and the fact that i can only spawn for 30 good seconds then i get ""frame rate unstable returning to main menu"". its just sad, i guess ill come back when its actually finished but for now im disappointed that i cant even play the game at all",0
Negative,"A lot of stutter and frequent FPS drop, no Ultrawide support (and can't use the UW fix else risk EAC ban), 60fps locked which on my monitor will not trigger Freesync Premium Pro. Been waiting on this for ages. but until it gets fixed, this review will stay negative.",0
Negative,"So many years of experience, and you can still get hit while being literally 2 meters away from the boss' sword. +there is still this idiotic input lag on roll, becuase sprint and roll are on the same button.Plus the game regularly ignores inputs. Of course all the fanboys are ignoring all these issues. doing so they're preventing from soft games from being actually good.Ive enjoyed DS3, played a lot of it, but omfg its completely unacceptable. we live in 2022, not 1993. Plus obnoxious and completely stupid fov, and NO FOV SLIDER WTF! My eyes literally physically hurt, had to use a fix, which works only withanti cheat disabled, so I cant play online, even though I've paid the full price, and not pirated the game, which now I know, I should have done.EDIT: I used to play it on a 1050ti, just bought an rx6600xt and it still stutters from time to time. With anti cheat left on its worse. All that wgile gpu usage is below 85% all the time, cpu usage around 35% or so.I enjoy the game but its heavily flawed. A little less flawed than previous games but still. but the fanboys will just call you a salty player that needs to get good anyways. Thats what stopping these games from being a way better experience.Also the game is very easy if youre not speedrunning. Ive died maybe like 10 times during my 105 hours. So im not just another salty player that needs to get good ok? I know what im saying.",0
Negative,"DO NOT BUY THIS GAME IN IT'S CURRENT STATE.

Negative,An AAA priced game locked to 60fps on PC with poor keybinds and limited options to rebind and awful performance is quite frankly unacceptable.If you've enjoyed other Dark Souls like games in the past this might be worth it if / when the performance gets patched but I would not recommend this game for anyone considering getting into the genre.,0
Negative,"An extremly poorly executed game. I bought it to play coop with my friends. It was the worst experience ever regarding how ""freely"" you can loot, lag, stability (crashes), disconnects, game mechanics, clunky user interface for PC and thought out coop mechanics.

Negative,"decided to stop playing due to crashes while playing for more than 2 hoursthe game is great but all of these technical issues only made playing it borderline impossible and not fun, the fact that they didn't fix the netcode of the original trilogy and the rushed implementation of EAC only shows how they tried to ship this fast, really fast even with the delay. i'll hold on my purchase and wait until the issues are fixed to try this again, which is a shame.",0
Negative,"buy literally any other souls game instead of this, not only is it technically broken (expect constant stuttering and crashes), but the game itself is basically some souls maps spread ever so thinly across a vast empty boring ass ""open world"" with copy pasted uninspired mini maps (dungeons) that barely reward you 99% of the time.not to mention that you have to endure that subpar quality content in order to be leveled enough for the actual main content - expect only around 10% of your time to be enjoyable.tl;dr a diluted dark souls, avoid this unless you've already played all their other game",0

Negative,"Despite what some people may say, factoring performance into a review is both necessary and rational. I am certain this game will be amazing, I just can't say for certain, because enemies and NPCs are invisible. Nowadays it seems to much to ask that a game just works well at launch. I am sure this issue and others will be patched imminently and I'm happy for those who are playing with no problems.",0
Negative,Spent 3 and a half hours trying to get the game set up so I could stream it cause friends wanted to see me fail at first ever FromSoft game only for a 30 minute stream of the game constantly not letting me play cause I was online despite being on offline mode and when I can finally get the game to go it runs like at a 1/8 of it's game speed leading to it crashing my enitre laptop cause I looked at the giant tree. I really want to play and love this game and set aside alot of time so I'd be able to play it immediately so will edit review once the game actually is playable but for now negative review. Also before anyone just says my laptop is shit I have a relatively new gaming laptop so it's not that and I reduced games quality would have also lowered the resolution but the game would freeze and undo any changes to resolution or window size,0

Negative,Garbage Net code and Garbage one shot mechanics. Bosses have about a week worth of effort put into design. 90% of the game is unplayable and unfun. If i wanted the experience this tried to give i would play Pokemon Arceus,0
Negative,"I am not a souls veteran. This is my opinion of it as an outsider. There will be no consistency to this. I have nothing good to say about this game.TLDR: It was a huge disapointment in both gameplay and storytelling.Out of context story. Just a bunch of fantasy words thrown at you with no context. Basically the story is this is a game and you are a gamer, now go that way. 40 hours in this is still true. edit: Beat the game and this is still true. edit: The story is also presented as like fucking cliff notes like what in the fuck why do we need to read every god damn item description to have any clue about the world? There are videos on YouTube of people explaining the world and referencing item descriptions. You have to keep clicking on NPCs to advance their dialog. Why not just give it all at once? Why do I need to reload the area to refresh their dialog if I somehow arbitrarily advanced their quest without knowing? God what awful story telling. Clunky combat and auto target mechanic leads to annoying deaths.Samey combat, no combos or anything. Mainly just waiting for the boss to finish their attack series. Feels kind of like a live turn based game. The meta seems to be: Find guide, build their build, wait for nerfs and buffs, find new guide. I tried playing it on my own with my own build. Of course the game is beatable with your fists and naked but 99% of us aren't going to do this, but making your own build will most likely lead to annoyances. Basically, get a katana, get bleed, stack arcane was the build I beat the last like 4 story bosses with. And easily. I was stuck on Malenia? Malia? Malek? I don't know, fucking GRRM is just a troll and I have no idea who the characters are cause they all have the same names. Anyway, I lost to her bullshit like 40 times. Swapped my build to blood katana bullshit and beat her first go. A meta in a single player game. Lol.Controls are really touchy or sluggish. No consistency.Open world acts more like a load screen between mob areas and dungeonsNo real coop seems like a very odd choice and no cross play?Can't compare items in shop with what is equipped. Why?No quest list? What can my idiot not read or write? We can read arcane descriptions of items but can't write down what NPCs said. I used a wiki to figure out what the hell was happening.Quests also make no sense. Random dude gives me a necklace. Mentions nothing about who it belongs to. Other random NPC says I found her necklace. ?Maybe my feelings will change as I play. I do feel a pull to play it but I also need to justify spending 60 dollars.edit: my feelings didn't changeedit: 20 hours in and all my points still stand. One of the most generic gaming experiences I've had, made completely unenjoyable by awful control schemeedit: keyboard prompts seem to be in, but no playstation controller prompts (i play with a ps5 controller). I have far less stuttering now.edit: I beat the game. The ending is pretty much the original mass effect 3 ending. Just changes the color of the sky. Also you literally choose your ending depending on which quest lines you completed. WHICH you can lock yourself out of randomly by doing other quests out of order. Random NPCs will be dead depending on progress of other quests. Neat.6/10 for reasons stated. I can't refund but this aint worth 60 bucks as a souls game outsider.edit: I'm demoting it to 5/10 for the laughable ending.If this is GOTY holy fuck gaming is dead. Awful basic combat gameplay that the original Fable did better, grade school math book problems had better story telling than this, samey bosses with the same kill series and the same hitboxes that are like 2m larger than their weapon or AOE, awful controls swinging between your fat mom getting off the couch and squirrel on crack. I got more satisfaction uninstalling the game after the sky box changed than ever beating any of the bosses.",0
Negative,"Nobody will care about my review but I have to write this. It pains me to no end but I have to, bc the pain this game inflicted on me mentally was so unbearable there's no way I'm keeping this good review unchanged after all this shit.I know Fromsoft games, I played them almost religiously for years and I really thought this one would be great or even better, but lmfao I was wrong. 1. Awful performance on pc. Cut my out of the game way too many times in the middle of a fight and left me to die, with no means to reopen the game window. After about 7 or 8 mad clicks it pops back up with me dead on the screen. Absolutely infuriating.2. Way WAY too many reused bosses, some of which are just normal enemies put into an arena with a health bar and boss music (and don't even start with that 'DaS1&2 did it too' argument, they did it and it was also very bad, the end). Almost every elite enemy and/or mini boss has at least three other variations elsewhere, either with some tiny modification in movesets to make them (sometimes unreasonably) more difficult, or plainly make it a double fight, or even triple. Peak game design right there.3. Large open areas filled with nearly identical enemies, like they have a pool of names and just pick random 4-5 types for each area without caring if they fit or not, and if they are individually too weak to hinder the player, make them twenty in number so they'll have a chance to gank them or waste more of their resources. Big landscape looking too empty? No problem, put a giant there, or a dragon, or a bear, and make it tanky as shit for no reason. It will work for the next 46 times, what do you mean the player will feel bored after the 6th time?4. Inconsistency in level difficulty (e.g. Eternal City), I got ganked by the mobs hard and then proceed to kill the area boss in 30 seconds, feels good, in a bad way.5. Dragged out weapon/ash leveling system & the whole tunnel/dungeon system, again with too many recycled bosses. It's becoming a chore and only worsens if the player wants to try out multiple weapons early on. Yes you can get the bells and shit but am I supposed to find them all without a guide, like I usually do for my first souls playthrough? By beating repeated bosses and exploring repeated tunnels? No, thank you. I'd rather not.1. Main bosses mostly gimmicky. No memorable 1v1, close-range, intense and satisfying tango style dance ever since Margit. No room for observing and learning. I just die, in an instant. They do not allow the player a comfortable pace like most Sekiro bosses, Nameless and Gale, or even Alonne and Fume knight, to actually FLOW in combat. They just murder you in the cheapest and quickest way possible and dare you to come back again to die again in 30 seconds bc let's be honest, getting one-shot is never fun, or good game design, even for Souls games.2. Boarderline artificial difficulty sometimes instead of 'hArD BUt FaIR'. Bosses often one-shot you and are tanky as fuck unless you go level up 20 times then return, which requires more grinding on the big wild repeated sections of the map.3. A bit too similar to previous titles in pretty much everything. beforehand I thought I'd enjoy it, but I really didn't. The surprise of seeing something familiar soon fade away into boredom after like the 20th time, and I just rush through the map hoping to find anything new even if it kills me, and well only found more reskined mini bosses.4. Short, easily missable NPCs quest lines, except for maybe two or three interesting ones, which can ALL be missed or messed up because you killed something in the wrong order or explored a new area too early. bc you're not looking at a guide lmao!5. Story does not hit the spot for me. Adult family drama might be cool for a tv show or a book but for a souls game? No. Just no. Even if you sugarcoat it with epic warfare and murders and literal gods it's just not interesting. It carries no weight and honestly feels more shallow than ever bc none of the big characters (gods and their kin) are driven by anything heroic or tragic, only seemingly superficial, basic needs like greed or desire. It's, well, not intriguing, at all. It's just not.6. That one mage in the Carian Study Hall, who also respawns like a normal mob after getting killed once. Fuck you.Nice world design, nice graphics, nice art choice.Wonderful music. The OST is still top-tier, everything from battle music to boss music to tranquil exploring music are all good, zero complaints in that department.Fluent combat as always, especially on horse, which usually feels clunky in some other titles.Perfect voice acting, again.The closed-in castle levels are mostly very well done and remind me of From's usual style. Tiny hidden areas like a village or a heavily guarded campsite with worthy rewards are also nice add ons.Cool animals and cool loots. Even if I don't use many of them it's always fun to check out what I picked up from a fresh kill Secrets, e.g. the mausoleums and some jump-required platforms, really enjoyable.A few endering NPCs. Lovable sorts ahead.Ok, I think I ranted enough. I don't expect anyone to see or care what I say. From what I've seen the media and major names in this community are claiming this to be the best Fromsoft games ever made, while the basic players are more or less finding issues here and there. And the problem is, the community is seemingly refusing to listen to any negative thoughts, even genuine critics about this game. Nothing can be said, even the most trivial thing. If you dare raise a finger on this game, the devoted fans will blunt you to death with 'git guds' and paragraphs of how they managed to beat the boss first try lol ez. I love Fromsoft games, Sekiro and BB being my top two. I can even say I'd give Elden Ring a 7.5/10, which is not too bad if you consider how much I just ranted. What I'm hoping, wishing to see is the company return to their actual root. Make something new, inspiring, challenging to the player and not forcing them to go with the meta or otherwise face the consequence.That's all. I think I'll take a break. If the game aims to tire me to my limits, then congrats ER you actually did it.",0
Negative,Great Game!But. Performance 0/10 even with 3060 ti constant stuttering!It doesn't even use my full graphics capacity. the optimisation is awful.no wide screen support.Graphics- 10/10Atmosphere- 100/10Music- EpicI would recommend to play. But we have to fight for our rights!,0
Negative,"Simply unplayable.or is it a hidden difficulty option!.8 core Desktop CPU running at 4.8ghz, 16gb of 4000mhz RAM, NVMe SSD with 3gb/s speeds, and a RTX 3070, yet I can't even get the game to run stable at 1080p with all graphics settings set to low and off where applicable. This is also after trying every possible fix floating around, I've implemented about 6 ""fixes"" if not more to no avail. The amount of chugging I had to endure while attempting to kill the golden horse dude was maddening. You'd think delaying the game would prevent this bs. Also, why 60fps cap!?Will be a great game once it's fixed.",0
Negative,What a fucking shame for a AAA game. I can't start the game because both Xbox One Controller (Wireless) & Xbox One 360 (Wired) are not recognized by the game (they work with the others DarkSouls games). And I refuse to waste my time trying some sketchy fix found on internet to make it work. I paid 60 hard earned euros for that . is it a jock ?,0
Negative,"This is not for PC players, and especially not co-op. I came into this game actually open minded and ready to start at level 1 and learn the ropes.The controls are horrible and frustrating to a PC user, you have to make many more clicks than necessary to put in commands. All pop-up hints are given with controller buttons without the keyboard equivalent, leaving you guessing and randomly pressing the most likely buttons. But that won't work because almost all commands that don't involve character movement are given by very inefficient methods. For example, if you want to go to the previous menu, you have to right click and select ""back"" from a whole list of commands rather than just hitting ""escape"". Seems a little picky of me and unimportant at first, but after about 30 minutes of doing that as fast as possible in character creation (your character will be pretty unappealing no matter what you do by the way) you will have already had enough of it for your lifetime.Most likely you will not be cooperating with any of your friends because of how difficult it is to connect with them. Trying to play with a friend in this game is more difficult than in any other game I've ever played. I picked up a couple of fingers and a finger cutter (basically the boot-kick button) and these connect me to my buddies by summoning them to my world if they set their world's password the same as mine and I press ""E"" on golden rocks that they drop? But if neither of us set passwords and drop a rock pile strangers can drag you in to fight by their side, or from what I've read people can drop in just to kill you if they feel like it.Also, these guys made about 50 million dollars and got an award within one day of release. Let that sink in. This game has mixed reviews and they are swimming in money like Uncle Scrooge.",0
Negative,"No PS button prompts. This issue does not apply to everyone, but for a game of this calibre released in 2022 there should be an option to toggle between XBox and PS prompts",0
Negative,"Update: Do not buy this game. Do not buy into the hype. The devs would rather devote time to banning users for acquiring cut content cosmetics than fixing any of the innumerable bugs. I had someone drop be the infamous Deathbed Smalls while doing co-op, tossed them in the chest and forgot about them. Now my account is in Quarantine for 180 Days and the appeal process is to delete your save and hope for the best.Absolutely unforgivable.Original ReviewI just can't in good conscious recommend this game in the state it is currently in right now.Very poorly optimized, but beyond that it still has Bandai's infamous XInput controller issue where it reads the wrong device as the controller, in my case my Razer Tartarus. This was a huge issue because the menus are designed for controller use and the default is controller prompts and not keyboard.Sorted that, but then the frames dropping. Look I'm not an FPS snob, but if a 8 Core 3.6GHz, 3070, with 32GB of Ram can't run this at a solid 60 FPS with settings on MEDIUM? Yeah, I tried the various work arounds and tweaks and they didn't help. Dropped it to 1920 x 1080, didn't help. For a Souls-like to have unstable frame rates from the company that invented the genre is an embarrassment.I want to love this game, it is everything a game like this should be: beautiful, intriguing, soul crushingly hard, rewarding, etc. But I can't, not until this is fixed.The controls need some work too, and the enemies' attack hit boxes. I've been clear and away from the attack and still damaged. Normally I'd have some video proof but I don't dare run OBS while playing.There's so much potential here, Elden Ring could be as genre-defining as Demons' Souls was. So my final thoughts are amazing potential, wait six months until it is on sale and hopefully be patched.",0
Negative,"Update: Steam keeps asking for an update since I've ""played"" more. So here's an update.Patch notes for the most recent patch include admissions that the games animations and hit boxes don't align. Reading between the lines a bit at least one of these was fixed. Other similar issues and/or other enemies where this issue exists is still out there. So. a game which relies on the ability to ""dodge"" enemies accurately fundamentally doesn't let the player do that. Awesome.Having discussed with other players familiar with the soul's franchise and the engine it seems theres a rumor that those with good hardware will also be at a disadvantage. In short, you only have so many i-frames. If you're rendering 120 frames, even if you're only displaying 60, you'll prematurely run out of i-frames. Can't confirm but considering the game is essentially a bad console port it seems plausible.Want to play with a friend? Great! Does you or your friend have a bad internet connection? I hope you like being banned for a week. I've found even properly exiting the game will be me the 'you need to quit through the main menu' message. At least for me the game soft locks my computer for at least a minute (I timed it) with a black screen when I do exit properly. Joy.Let's not forget, even if you explicitly tell the game to NOT save your save file in the cloud it still does it. Steam still won't refund the game. Keeps referencing their 2 hour policy despite them being able to give exceptions and my first requesting it only a bit over 2 hours. Referencing the broken state of the game. Etc.At this point I've only been playing to help friends through bosses and certain areas. Sadly, like spicy food, they're masochists addicted to the terrible game play and ""awesome!"" graphics.-Sadly it's yet another souls like game that plays terribly on PC. Stuttering even on a 5950X & RTX3090. Only occasionally compared to some I've heard of but It shouldn't be a problem at all even on middle of the road hardware.It can auto detect settings for monitor and input devices but won't switch out of xbox controller default for the ""how to"" popups and menus. You have to do that manually IF you know about the setting and can find it.As far as game play goes it gets repetitive fast. About the only interesting thing is finding randomly glitched enemies who will see you and use ranged attacks prior to even loading visually for you, despite you hiding, and despite their fellows who are closer not detecting you. And lets not forget the difficulty. It's not hard. The hardest part of the game isn't tricky bosses and ever changing battle dynamics. The hardest part of the game is memorizing attack sequences of bosses and dodge timing because even though you are far away from the area of attack and the attack animation isn't even near you - you will get hit. Or the arrows/bolts will turn mid air to hit you. Or the boss will turn an extra 360* to ""hit"" you even though their attack animation has finished.Given steams apparently now ""strict"" 2 hour refund policy despite the game being in such a poor state I'd recommend a hard pass.",0
Negative,"I have never had this many issues running a game before in my entire life. The UI for the advanced settings is poorly designed and the game itself has very little optimization done for the PC port. My recommendation, if you are set on purchasing this game, it may be best to wait until the developers make it playable first. If not, then be prepared to never make it past the character creation.",0
Negative,"Hurts to have to write this because FromSoft makes my absolute favorite games, but in its current state, ER is unplayable and I can't recommend it. I definitely have the hardware necessary to run the game and I have tried on basic settings and the highest and the result is the same. Can't even get past the first mini boss due to the insane stuttering and frame drops. I really hope they fix the game quickly. I have a PS5 and can buy and play the game there, but I don't want to reward the devs for this. I don't mind supporting FromSoft as I have already bought a second copy for a friend who lives in Europe, but I can't give them more cash until this is fixed.Addition 3/2/22Post patch the game runs much better and although it's still got its blips here and there, it is not recommendable.Edit 4/20/22I have been trying for around 4 days to get this game to run properly on a laptop with a 2060 super and 4k screen. I cannot get it to run any higher than 45 fps with constant frame drops. I have the current driver installed for the GPU and tried all of the fixes under the sun. The game continues to run like hot garbage. Cannot recommend this game until FromSoft fixes the optimization issues.",0
Negative,"get the game for its main campaign, do not waste your time playing multiplayer. servers are so jancky and the netcode is absolutely atrocious. hit box is an absolute fucking joke too. recently tried getting back into it. the IGN guide builds and bleed archetypes are rampant. fuck this game",0
Negative,"Edit: This is a revision to the review.It had been a while since I've last played the game and tried to get back into it playing with friends in co-op. To be short, this game is borderline unplayable if you're looking to play with friends. The game will constantly crash you back to your desktop even if you try verifying the game's files. It looks to be fine solo and the invaders seem to not have a hard time connecting to you. TLDR: Co-op is garbage. Solo is fine. Invaders connect just fine.",0

Negative,This game is really good from what ive been told and seen but due to the circumstances i have been through with my purchase of this game i will have to say proceed with caution. There are other people who have had the problem of their integrated gpu being used instead of the normal one. I have tried all the same things as those people plus more to get this game to run off my 1070 and it will not. I even tried to disable my igpu altogether and default everything to my 1070 and it instead tried to run solely off my CPU. Ive factory reset my computer been in my bios and everything and it will not run properly. I am a diehard fromsoft fan and from what ive seen this game is phenomenal; however i find it hard for me to recommend this game on PC in its current state. It was delayed numerous times so this kind of thing wouldnt be a problem but here we are. Literally more than half of the reviews that are bad are strictly because of performance issues. I know 6 people who got this and don't have these problems so we'll say in my case a 1 in 6 chance your game doesnt work.,0
Negative,"Constant frame drops, impossible to go through any boss fights with out frames suddenly dropping to 20 or lower essentially causing the game to freeze or stutter, I would not recommend buying this game until this issues have been fix as it appears to be a pretty widespread issue.",0
Negative,"You can't pause the game. At all. Ever.It is truly incredible to me that a large group of professional game developers went through all the work to make this game, and thought, yeah that's a good idea. I really am astounded.Obviously there's lots of other problems with the game, but for me, this is enough reason alone for a refund.",0
Negative,"Fantastic game, gives me some more Gothic vibes that I didn't get as much from the previous games and it is probably one of the best open world games i've played in recent memory if not ever, massive world with lots of things to see and do and it doesn't feel empty or pointless unlike many other open world games. Lots of customization, lots of ways to approach combat and exploration, the horse, all the new systems, and many other things. It's a spectacular game and it feels as if it were some mix of the best parts of the Dark Souls franchise with the best parts of the worlds of games like BotW, all in the LotR setting. But the release build was a mess. Despite the two patches my game still stutters like crazy, sometimes it freezes completely for 30s or so, sometimes it freezes only until i move my mouse (?) but I'm playing with a controller. I went as far as disabling EAC using that one trick I wont disclose here risking getting a ban just so mobs could stop showing invisible even when they're on my face, but it only reduced it some, not remove it completely. Even with all those very serious performance issues that would make anyone else quit I'm still playing it and enjoying it to my fullest.I remembe Dark Souls III launch being also quite rough, but it wasn't as bad as this. At this point in life japanese developers should have just stopped putting so little effort when it comes to their PC launches and their performance/settings and no, this is not something exclusive to From Software.It gets a negative review from me FOR NOW, not because the game is bad but rather because it seriously needs some performance patches as soon as possible since I know I'm one of thousands having any or all of these problems, especially people with high end computers, way better machines than mine.",0
Negative,Eh Just not my style game after-all . Pretty but also disappointing that ultrawide isnt supported.,0
Negative,game is for hardcore players only if your a casual pc gamer stay away.,0
Negative,beauiful except for the bad optimizationedit: nvm the dlc sucks,0
Negative,"Not often do I find myself giving a negative review but this is definitely one of those cases. First some good points.It is a very pretty game if you have the graphics card to drive it. Combat looks visceral and dynamic if a little lacking in variety of attacks but I would be guessing this would get better as you unlocked more (if you can play that far). The world looks alive and real.It has the dark and gritty feel of a Dark Souls game with a depth of story you just know it will take hours to unfold.Now the bad.Oh boy do the controls suck for PC. If you are used to playing with a controller and this was how you were going to play it may suit. Keyboard and mouse make it a horrific experience for me. If moving in a vaguely linear direction it feels okay but as soon as you want to turn to look at something while still moving the camera and direction controls want to fight each other, you have no real idea as to where your character is looking. Add that to combat and one dodge, jump or strafe and I had zero idea of where I was looking to strike next. I have heard for casters/ranged it can be easier with autolock on but I didn't buy a souls like game to have my hand held just to be able to hit something. Makes blocks, combos etc, hard to do.I know that on some Console to PC ports controls mapping can be a bit haphazard but boy does this game really suck at it. From as soon as it loads it continues to show ""Press X to continue"", ""Press RT to select"" or Press B to go back"" without a single optional idea of what its keyboard equivalent is. Even going into key mapping and looking at what key does what doesn't really help as it does not tell you what RT is supposed to be. Menu? Select? Coffee machine? Just keep pressing buttons and hope. Sometimes you might get luck and get a menu to pop up. Congrats, now select your selection and exit. But wait! The button you pressed to get the menu won't let you exit. Or sometimes even get out of the select line. So I guess you just head to key mapping and see what key it is? Nope not listed. Sometimes its escape. Sometimes you need to right click your mouse button and navigate a second menu which is conveniently positioned behind the menu you first selected.That framerate ceiling of 60fps bottoms out real quick and I don't know if it is the cause but I was feeling nauseous after about 10mins of playtime and I have never had that happen in any other game. No Ultra widescreen support? Considering how many PC gamers are headed this way, it seems a mistake to not take advantage of that.Yes I know the player message system is supposed to be a way of players helping each other. Has anyone seen a helpful one yet? Or just masses of trolls that you have to read through in hope you didn't miss something important and waste 5 mins looking for a hidden passage that wasn't there. I probably wouldn't mind so much if not for that every 5 steps you get a ""Press Y to read message"" flash on you screen as you fight your way forward.After struggling through a painful hour of game play my first thought was attempt a refund. But I really, really want this to be good so I will keep it and hope for a patch or 6 before attempting again. Now I am willing to believe there are players who haven't had the same experience as I, and I am very envious. But I cannot recommend this to PC players in it's current state.TLDR: Might be good in future. Hold off buying until future patches might make it better playing experience.",0
Negative,Year 1999 - Alien VS Predator supports native ultrawide resolution2022 - AAA game Elden Ring does NOT!,0
Negative,More like Elden StudderRingAmirite?,0
Negative,poor pc performance. the game is good but the stuttering and frame rate issues force me to leave a no review as it significantly hampers the experience. Will change this review if/when the issues are fixed,0
Negative,Don't bother to play Elden Ring on PC. Frame-rate issues galore and the controls are abysmal at best. The game defaults to Xbox controls so you don't even have any idea how to do anything until you figure out how to change the display. I am shocked with how poorly optimised this game is for PC. I have requested a refund after an hour of stumbling around.,0
Negative,"Incredible game, terrible port. I'll change this to a positive when they actually fix the horrendous FPS and Stutter issues that make the game unplayable in a lot of places.2024 UPDATE:DLC has released after 2 years and it came with a big patch. Still runs like trash and stutters, good job FromSoft. GOTY btw, can't even function without mods that break the online after 2yrs and multiple patches.",0
Negative,"Idk. I got frustrated trying to figure out how the controls worked and which key corresponded to the controller-based prompts. Pretty poor Keyboard and Mouse support. I returned it, looks like an amazing game though, maybe I'll buy it again in the future if I decide to buy a controller I could pair.",0
Negative,"Until the FPS stuttering issues get fixed, this game is not worth playing on PC. I tried various community fixes mentioned elsewhere but the stuttering is still there.Update for badge",0
Negative,Game is so hard that I can't beat the BANDAI NAMCO Entertainment screen.,0
Negative,Still runs like shit,0
Negative,FUCK THIS GAME it set me back like 18 hrs of grinding and progress did not save whole day of grinding and multiplayer is unstable,0
Negative,Unfortunately FromSoftware lacks the development knowledge to properly optimize their games for PC making it a painful experience. After patching the stutters persists and the game is more frustrating due to the technical issues rather than the difficulty of the gameplay. I do not recommend it on PC right now. If you own a console pick it up there instead.Don't get me wrong the game is great but until they fix the technical issues I won't bother playing it on PC. The technical problems this game is having should technically not exist coming from an experience studio therefore I find it unacceptable and embarrassing.,0
Negative,"This game is simultaneously some of the best, most creative work that Fromsoft has put out to date while also being some of the most tedious game play I have seen from them so far. The design of the Lands Between is phonomenal, but they will also fill the dungeons with the same boss fights. Some fights you will repeat 5 times at least. This game is a gigantic, beautiful waste of time. Too many boss fights require pixel perfect timing, and meta building of your character. Also includes gorgeous landscapes filled with largely nothing useful to the player character. Maybe an item or spell you do not care about.There are also some memorable moments I will think back on fondly like beating Radahn for the first time, or entering the lower landscapes of the main land.Don't play this.",0
Negative,"The combat play is fun and environment is awesome, however the game is significantly handy capped by the follow:1. Poor UI design for PC (menus are not easy to use, no info pop-ups, equipping items is jarring)2. Group play is craptastic, group is unnecessarily complex, when you die the group breaks, when you defeat a boss the group breaks up. You cannot travel as a group, it is only for boss take downs.3. Controls are messed up. Keyboard and mouse menu navigate was not possible without change game settings. XBox controller didn't work after hours of tinkering with Steam settings, despite the fact the device works with every other game.Elden Ring is just to focused around being a console game and PC appears to be an after thought, a cash grab.",0
Negative,"Ended up refunding this game because it's not true multiplayer. If you've ever played Outward, I was expecting something more like that with multiplayer, where you could run around with your friends and do whatever you want to, including dungeons, etc.This was a huge let down for me as I don't particularly enjoy single player games, but that's basically what this is. You're only allowed to fight area bosses with your friends. Really ruined it for me.",0
Negative,Did not meet the expectations set by the previous games. Also is just annoyingly designed in many areas,0
Negative,The map button is G,0
Negative,"I'm giving Elden Ring a bad review based on the implementation of multiplayer. The game is very beautiful , so artistically it is awesome. If you got the game intended for single player. then again. probably not bad.But I purchased the game for its co-op multiplayer ability that I heard was a feature. A game where you could adventure like in Titan Quest or Dungeon Seige or . (not exactly the same ""type"" of game, but I hope you get the point"".) In those games, which are truly multiplayer co-op, you can adventure as a party. That's the part of the fun. Have a party of different attributes that complement each other member of the party to go questing and exploring.Well, don't know what they were thinking when they designed the multiplayer function of Elden Ring, but it is . to say it plainly. just AWFUL. and here is why.1) There is no lobby for you to group up and then go do your co-op questing. You each have to get so far in your game (not necessary bad , so that you can learn the game) at which at some point you can then do multiplayer. but its not that simple as you well see.2) In order to do multiplayer, you have find a merchant and spend what I would call money that you got from killing stuff (its not call money. but just simplifying it here). It cost 1000 of these ""tokens"" and the merchant only has a few of them 3 or 4. some merchants don't have any. So right of the bat. this is bad. merchant doesn't have item. you can't co-op with friends. if you don't have the ""money"". you can't co-op with friends.3) Once you have the item, then you need to communicate to your party, perhaps over steam chat, discord, whatever tool you use and tell them to ""make a sign"" with this finger you found earlier in the game. It makes some gold runes on the ground. THEN you with the item you just purchase for 1000, activate that item and if you are all in the right spot. you can see the runes on the ground and invite your crew. So make sure you are in the right spot else you just wasted item that costed 10004) Great. your are all finally in your group. YIPPEE. oopps one of your buddies for some reason gets disconnected. dang. ok.no problem you think. you'll just re-invite him. but wait it's not that simple,as I said before. there is no lobby. you have to consume another one of those special 1000 token items. They are used up each time. so to get your buddy back in. cough up another 1000 . and if you at the point where you are out of money or out of those special items. so sad your buddy can't join.5) But lets say everything goes smoothly. you are all at the correct location in the game, your network connection is fantastic, and everyone is ready to get going. YIPPEE. So there you go adventuring together finally. You see some enemies and your are all excited to start fighting. (now, if you are familiar with Dark Soul type games. it can be easy for some people to die. rather quickly. The fight begins, you are dodging like a mad man. you're amazing. then you get speared in the head. dead. bang and you are knock out of the game. If you were ""invited"", you return to your own world. If you want to rejoin your party. guess what. the host has to cough up another 1000 tokens and have items to use. otherwise. too bad soo sad, you ain't rejoining the party.6) But lets say you are a party of veterans. this is easy peasy.at first. But as you proceed on. sooner or later you start taking damage. but hey. there are these ""potions"" you can take to heal you . super. Ok. I'm out . umm. no place to buy these. OH Wait. in single player I remember. I just go do these little glowing things on the ground where I can rest, and I get my health and potions back. BUT NOOOOO. not in multiplayer. you can't activated them while others are ""in"" your game. So sooner or later. you or someone in your group is going to run out of health and we bounce from the game where you need to come up with another 1000 tokens to get them back it. PURE STUPIDTIY.7) But it doesn't stop there. other players, that you don't invite. can just ""invade"" your world. I'll admit the concept is kind of cool all except that the way multiplayer is implemented totally SUCKS. this just adds to the suckiness. If the invading player kills one of your party. then as explained multiple times already. cough up another 1000 tokens to get the person back and thats ONLY if the merchant has the items to sell. which sometimes is not the case. So although the idea of the ""invading"" player is interesting, the implementation of multiplayer makes this just another nail in the coffin , thorn in the side, blah blah blah. you get the point.So to sum up. if you got the game, purely for single playing. and you like Dark Souls games. then you'll like this game. IF you got this game thinking it would be a fun co-op game to play with buddies over the weekend. then save your collective $240 (4 people to a party) and pass on the game. there are other other adventuring co-op games better suited.",0
Negative,"Just a big sad fail on the PC port of such a great game :< Wait for patch that will most likly never come, not good enough before it.",0
Negative,"Pro's : beautiful game, music great cons: crafting hard to figure out, no real direction . Also will note this is my first Dark souls esq game I've played and I'm sure hard core players will love this game.",0
Negative,"Excellent game, truly outstanding. Very poor performance. Probably should have bought it on the SeX.- 3080- i9 9900k- 32gb ram",0
Negative,"I'm sorry, but right now this is not a good game. It fucking lags on an R5, 16Gb of RAM and a 3070 in 1080p. (CPU and GPU usage is sitting around 50-60% at 60fps) WHAT. THE. FUCK. Also it's locked 60 fps, there are INVISIBLE enemies, shooting arrows at me THROUGH a giant fucking monster I'm trying to fight between stutters. Yeah, 10/10 my ass, I refuse to believe none of the reviewers had any problems on PC, because right now it's just a rage inducing shitshow.",0
Negative,"At the moment, I'm afraid I have to give this a down vote, and sadly, even before I could get into the game proper. Now, I know there will be those who will balk at the negative review, without being in the actual game play, but, considering my own difficulties with this game, I have to be honest, it wasn't worth me even tryign to play, with the current limitations, which I'll discuss further down.I was looking forward to this, and bought it quickly. Installed and loaded up, to find that all menu controls showed controller buttons (I don't even own a controller). It took me a while to figure out that right clicking brought up a context menu to get me around the menu. 'OK, I can live with that,' says I. I then go to redefine keys, and THIS is why the game gets my down vote (currently). Because of 'accessibility issues', I have to remap pretty much all controls on every game I play to the right hand side of the keyboard and the many, many buttons on my mouse. The problem was that most of the keys around the numeric keypad couldn't be defined, neither could the thumb buttons and the middle mouse button on the mouse. These are absolutely critical for me to play, especially a game that requires quick reflexes. In the era of accessibility being a major factor in design, this is a woeful oversight on the part of the developers when they ported to PC.I would love to give this game another go, but I need to be able to redefine all keys, wherever I need them to be, for me to do so. If you need to redefine keys as I do, here's a brief list of what isn't mappable at the time of writing (this is not an exhaustive list, just the ones I found trying to do my own remapping of keys):Mouse (Logitech G602):Middle mouse click (on the scroll wheel)Middle left click (moving scroll wheel left)Middle Right click (moving scroll wheel right)Thumb Button 1Thumb button 2Keyboard (All of these are the keys around the numeric keypad on my G910 keyboard)/ *-+. (Del)0 (Insert)I hope this is helpful.",0
Negative,"I never enjoyed the Dark Souls games, nor did I enjoy Sekiro. I don't know why I thought Elden Ring would be any different. I simply don't see what people see in the gameplay of these games. It's slow and clunky, and not in a ""realistic"" sense. More so in a ""punish you for the sake of punishing you"" sense.To those who enjoy this genre, all the power to you. But, to those who are like me and never loved Souls-like gameplay, don't expect Elden Ring to change your mind.",0
Negative,"Amazing game - Terrible Multiplayer.I've played around 8 hours between yesterday and today with my friend. I say ""with"" but really it's 95% just doing our own thing in our own worlds while being on call together trying to stay around the same areas and doing the same things at the same time. Although that is still fun, it's not multiplayer. This is the current situation of multiplayer in Elden Ring.When you figure out how to actually summon friends into your world after google searches and world tutorials, you think ""awesome, now we can play together"" however, this is short lived, as you'll soon realise that you can't explore properly! There's a barrier of how far you can travel. For example, if you summon your friend inside a cave, you can't leave the cave. you have to fight the boss at the end, then after you've killed it, your friend will be forced back into their own worlds. Meaning you actually spend about 10 minutes with them in your world before spending the next hour and half alone trying to match up where you're both going and doing.Also, that's not to mentioned that if one of you dies while your friend is in your world, he'll be taken back to his world again and we have to start it all over again. Collect the flowers or spend 1000 runs to buy the summoning item, go to the cave, friend has to request a summons, summon the friend, clear the dungeon and beat the boss if you're lucky, then get taken straight back to their world. That's also not to mentioned that your friend will have limited healing as well. I carry 4 healing flasks, when I joined my friends world I could only use 2. meaning more death. You also can't use Grace's, ride your horse or fast travel in multiplayer.It's a good idea in theory but when you're playing for hours without seeing your friend, it's boring. It's not a true coop experience where you're all in the world at the same time like Baldurs Gate 3 or Borderlands. It's just 10 minutes of on specific area to help kill a boss with 2 hours of exploring on your own trying to figure out if you and your friend are at the same bit. Apart from this, the game is amazing but for god sake, just let me play coop with my friends. permanently no fingers. no barriers that stop you from exploring, no if you die then they get removed from the lobby, no limited healing. It's the only thing that lets this game down honestly.",0
Negative,"I would have liked to do a good review but I can't. Visually the game is stunning, the character generation was neat. Gameplay vids looked neat, I was looking forward to this. But almost immediately there are things that caused the breaks to be hit. Now I know that people might be comparing this to Souls games, but I have to compare this to Monster Hunter. You can run around and do things in the world, but in a boss fight one miss step and you get to start the whole experience over again. If you liked the Monster Hunter experience, then you are going to have fun. if you don't, then save yourself the trouble and frustration. More on this below.STRIKE 1 - Keyboard Support[/u}So entering the game (Unless you go into settings for this which required direction for me to change), everything is set up for controller support. The whole game seems designed specifically for controllers with secondary thought for keyboard/mouse. I have been doing shooters for a while now but how the keyboard is default set up makes it rather more of a train wreck waiting to happen rather than playing a game where thought was given to how this will work with a keyboard.STRIKE 2 - Opening Sequence & First StepsSo going through the opening movie sequence was rough. I don't want to give spoilers., oh wait I can't because they don't tell you what is going on in the opening movie much less even when you take your first steps. I had no idea what I was doing and what was going on other than I got up and I have a weapon in my hands. So I stumbled around like a drunk idiot until I ran into the first boss and got curb stomped for my troubles. Wait., why am I here again and what the heck is going on? Oh right I don't know why I am here and even why that thing just kicked me into the atmosphere.[u}STRIKE 3 - Combat and Bosses[/u]Yea., so even though this is not going to be popular, I have done shooters for a long time now. I am not though very good when it comes to reaction time. So doing combat that relies super heavily on reaction times is not good. The added thing that does not help is that the enemies are all invisible. Nice, thanks guys. So I don't have a good reaction time to begin with, so let's remove my ability to plan for the engagement. Swell. So not having an enemy to attack, but that can most definitely attack you, is a big hell no. But then let's run into a boss and ratchet up that hell no into hard no category. This is why I said this falls into the Monster Hunter category rather than anything else, as the boss is there, but if you take one bad step, you have to reload and do this all over again because you die in 1-2 hits. Excellent. Even the second boss, not only will I get one shot, but he is invisible, can only be seen by his footfalls and if he swipes at you, and the keyboard is not how you are apparently supposed to be fighting these things, so it is clunky and annoying to swing around and swipe back. By the time you do attack these invisible enemies, they are long gone and you get attacked again by something that is not there.CONCLUSIONFor me, it's a hard no as three strikes and you are done. This is just my viewpoint, and as I have been saying, if you are a Monster Hunter fan, this game is going to be for you. If games like that made you want to smack a goat, then don't come near it as it is going to frustrate you and have you out $70. I am not a fan of insta kills, and not a fan of boss fights that kill you in 1 - 2 hits because you steps in the wrong place. I want to be able to play a game, struggle a bit, a bit of difficulty, and get into epic battles where I can live a power fantasy (As we all do or we wouldn't be playing these games). Insta death and/or 2 hit kill mechanics are not what I want in life, as I am not super reactionary and will just be reloading adnausium.",0
Negative,"Terrible port onto PC, you are required to have a controller to navigate menus.Poor performance.Just awful.",0
Negative,"Played now for a couple of hours. For me Souls-like and open world does not work. I loved to learn all the levels in DS by heart to master them, in an open World this doesn't work. :(For me it seems like quantity over quality. Don't get me wrong, the game is not bad, and I still having fun, but it starts to get boring already and I haven't even finished the main quest line. It feels like assassin s creed or the other sand box games, which I don't really like.Further the game is technically pretty poor! I mean I have a RTX3090 and I still getting frame drops down to the 40th Framerate is capped to 60 fps and Ultra-Wide-Screen is not supported. However that can be fixed by 3rd party mods, BUT if you use these you need to play offline, or they might bann you for using cheat tools . I mean we have 2022 and those features are state of the art, sad that you need mods to fix what the devs didn t achieve.Summary:So overall no bad game, but it s not 10/10 like most websites states.Souls fans might have fun, if you can get familiar with the open world concept.Technical issues are present but it is playable.",0
Negative,"Though I've been playing it and to an extent enjoying it, I cannot get over the massively glaring issues that this game currently suffers from:- No ultrawide support (Game renders at ultrawide, they just put black bars on the screen regardless)- Capped at 60 frames (The best sign of a bad and lazy console port)- Random frame drops (Considering the game sometimes requires frame perfect play, this is game breaking at times)The souls games have all been brought to the PC market and with the original series I accepted that they might be poor ports, but the remasters (that were outsourced) show that it's perfectly possible to port these games well and with all the support the PC platform needs/deserves. Modders have already - within 10 hours of release - fixes ALL of the problems above, but thanks to EAC being part of this new title we cannot take advantage of that without the risk of being banned. So you either fix it but never get to play with other players, or you leave it in it's currently horrible state and play with others.",0

Negative,No native ultra wide support. Can't change monitors. Controller-centric on boot-up which sucks when creating a character (change the tooltips to keyboard/mouse before starting otherwise you're going to have a bad time). Not ready for PC - yet.,0
Negative,"ConclusionOnly recommend buying if you like dying over and over again without any hints of what to do, frantically running around to find the correct challenge for your current progress. Alternatively you can spend as much time outside of the game as inside the game investigating what you actually are supposed to do, looking up controls, trying to get explanations on how the game systems work and what they mean.I love pain and headaches and success by trial and error and error and error and error so I will probably keep playing but I would only recommend to very very few others.TechnicalGame crashed 3 times for me the first 2hours. After that it has run without crashing or stuttering. (nvidia 3090, intel i7-10700, 32gb ram, nvme disk, win11)Lacks ultrawide support, you will get black bars :(.The games graphics and audio is at best mediocre for a 2022 title.ControlsI accidentally started the game the first time with a controller plugged in, which I guess made the game show all prompts in the menu for controllers and left me with no idea on how to navigate the game menu. Had to look up on youtube how to navigate backwards, to allow me to even start a game.The game does not tell you that you can sprint or target lock manually, and the keybindings are simply missing in the menu so you have to guess the keys,I wonder what other controls I have missed that are not present in the options menu.The target system is very un-intuitive to me, the locks keeps disappearing at seemingly random times, maybe something with LOS I'm not sure yet.The world and progressionThe open world seems very empty when running between caves or dungeons and the game does not let you know where you should go to find an appropriate challenge, so you can easily spend a lot of time running in the wrong direction that will only leave you with way to difficult enemies.At a certain point in the game you get transported to another area with no exit and a very hard enemy. I spend hours trying to progress further by slaying this enemy until I rage quit out to youtube only to find out that you are just supposed to fast travel out of there without any fighting.",0

Negative,"The game being marked on steam & marketed as ""online Co-op"" is basically a straight up lie. If you are looking to buy the game to mainly play with a friend(s). Don't.The system for joining another players game is archaic but nonetheless it works so it's a small complain. The problem is you only join another players game as some sort of weird helper thing, you do not progress in you own world when in another players world.This means that if you wanna progress together, you have to complete a section of content together as one person being the host and then switch to the other person and do the exact same section of content again.

Negative,"Honestly tried to enjoy this game, however everything seems to be difficult arbitrarily. The bosses have no sense of inertia and can change direction while mid-air making every fight basically the same.Boss goes into hyper attack mode, telegraphed attack, then you get one attack while they recover.rinse repeat until fight complete. Then you get rewarded with a useless crafting component and possibly a weapon/armor piece that really doesn't make a difference. Skill points are scaled based on level so if you max any stat one point on any other stat is just as expensive as the maxed stat point. Gathering in the open world is pointless. I gathered countless flowers, etc. and there was nothing to do with them.Why can't we have a damn journal to at least track the progress of our quests? We can fast travel, harvest runes, have a flying horse but we can't muster the ability to write in a journal to keep track of what we do in a massive world? People can defend it all they want but the devs just left out all QOL features. That's not difficulty. That's bad game design. TLDR: I feel that this is one of those mile wide. 1"" deep games where the devs made everything extra frustrating to keep people playing and it's supported by ravenous fans who will defend it with ""Git Gud Scrub"" comments.",0
Negative,"I refunded my copy. First FromSoft game I've ever gotten rid of, and I've been a fan since a few months after DeS released.The game looks good, looks fun, etc. It is failing to even launch for a sizable portion of the PC community. When it does launch, many (most?) are having at least one of: framerate issues, tearing, stuttering, black bars obscuring the screen, & plenty of other graphical issues which make the game unplayable. There seems to be no rhyme or reason hardware-wise, as lower-quality setups are running the game with fewer issues than higher-quality setups. NVIDIA/AMD/Intel/etc is not a factor as these issues affect people with parts from all major hardware manufacturers. Solutions which work for some people are not universal, even to people with the same or similar hardware specs.Easy Anti-Cheat was added to the game at the very last minute (literally AFTER streamers received their early access copies) & this has been diagnosed as the exclusive cause for these issues. EAC prevents unofficial patches to fix the issue. Copies of the game with EAC disabled are free from these issues for most people playing those copies, but obviously those copies can't participate in multiplayer, which has always been a staple of Souls games.FromSoft released a patch today which allegedly fixed the stuttering/framerate issues - it did for SOME players, but not for others. Their solution to the ""game fails to even open"" issue was to ensure that you only have Latin characters in your Steam name. This doesn't make a single bit of sense for a JAPANESE game developer. It is also not a fix to the issue, as plenty of players (me included) have never had a non-Latin character in their Steam account name in the entire account's history.yet the game still won't open.FromSoft games are fun & mechanically well-made, but the company has a long history of absolutely janky PC ports. The PC community knew to expect jank with ER as well, but not nearly this bad of it. When FS fixes their issues, I'll edit the review & re-buy the game.Edit: Game's fun, not the best Soulsborne but far from the worst. Issues were never resolved on FS's end, I just bought new PC parts and the game works with the new parts.",0
Negative,"Despite of new update, still cannot play on my notebooks with some reason that does not explained. Im afraid that I cant refund the game.",0
Negative,multiplayer is unplayable,0
Negative,"I didn't get 5 minutes in. The controls were extremely annoying. Annoying to the point that I wasn't even interested in playing by the time I was done. To me, it appeared to be far more towards someone with a controller and not a keyboard.",0
Negative,"This is so painful to write. The game, at the current state is simply dissapointing. I don t even know where to start.Let me start by saying that I am a huge Dark Souls saga fan, I played more than 700 hours between all of them, I knew that Elden Ring was not going to be a Dark Souls game, but an evolution of it. But what I have discovered so far is not keeping up with the hype I had.First let s talk about the worrisome technical issues: It took more more than 1 hour just to make my gamepad able to work with the game. I literally have to launch the game through Steam Big Picture, otherwise it won t detect that I even have a gamepad. It is the first time ever I have an issue of this kind in any game.The optimization is close to non-existant, the stuttering make my eyes bleed. I tried some solutions mentioned by the community and disabling ""Microsoft Device Association Root Emulator"" seems to fix most of the issues. But again, first time ever that I have an issue of this kind with any game, in my life. Also the game crashed a couple of times.This is not Ubisoft, and you literally used the same Engine as for your previous games, how could they mess up so badly? You are not an Indie developer neither, this is supposed to be a AAA game, and I paid 60 euros for this, I don t expect to have any of these problems.Technical issues aside, let s talk now about the gameplay. What really grinds my gears is that it seems like most of the enemies in this game are literally damage sponges, and Dark Souls WAS NEVER ABOUT THAT! Dark Souls are very hard games, but at least most of the bosses can be defeated withing a few combos, but in Elden Ring it s all about trying to survive and kick their asses literally for 5 minutes, looking how for every hit you land on them barely a 2% of their health bar recedes. And their damage output is just ridiculous, I am going with a heavy armor build and a buff to reduce the damage received on myself, and still, most bosses will delete me in 1 hit! I tried to summon a couple of players to help me out, just to watch how 5 seconds after going into the boss area they were wiped out in a single blow by the enemy boss. 1 single blow. and their whole health bar was gone. And I still didn t move out from the first region where I started my adventure, where it is supposed to be easier.Another thing that really grinds my gears is that you can see that this game was created from Dark Souls 3 as a template. because they didn t even bother to change most of the animations, sounds and some equipment. They just copied them straight from DS3! What kind of lazy work is this? I can t really recommend the game in the current state, although I know for sure that many of these issues will be fixed after some patches. From one side I try to push myself to keep playing, but from other side It is really demotivating to see how all my plans and strategies to defeat some bosses fail try after try because the simplest of their attacks will kill, or nearly kill me.Dark Souls games were hard, but never unfair as Elden Ring is.",0
Negative,Paid full price before launch for a game that will not load past a White screen,0
Negative,Bad Performance Bad Review. Easy. Since the hype is gone for me now I can wait for a sale anyway.,0
Negative,Game is great but putting people with legit versions at a disadvantage and not implementing basic PC features like uncapped frames and free resolutions is lame.,0
Negative,"how could a huge company fail so miserabaly .49 minutes of trying to fix the white screen crash, I magine how hard I tried!Refund please.",0
Negative,Update your engine and at least double the fps to 120.,0
Negative,Fuck the Haligtree,0
Negative,I will update my review after they have fixed FPS performance ( I did everything on the internet but not working with me :( ),0
Negative,"- Suffers from a lot of stuttering- 60fps cap in the current year is just embarrassing- They shoved in an anti-cheat at the last minute instead of fixing their network code, which is just lazy and prevents people from creating cool modsPatches are needed before this is playable.",0
Negative,"Awful optimization. Also, why locking the framerate at 60 for a 2022 PC game? MH Rise had a better porting than this (and it's a Switch game). I'm speechless.Right now I don't even care if the game is good or not. Developers need to understand that many PC users are sick tired of demented ports like this.",0
Negative,"dont. im only doing it for my stream, thought it would be on par with sekiro but sadly its not. id go into detail but so many others have already voiced their concerns. i will change my review once this game is fixed carefully. not a horrible game like kingdom hearts 3. but if i were you id hold off. oh and f ez anti cheat. bandai/fromsoft REMOVE EZANTICHEAT",0
Negative,"I'm so sad to have to write a negative review because of all my anticipation and love for this game and love for the series.Regardless of how much you spend on your computer, you WILL experience stutters that will make you miss rolls, abilities, attacks and take damage. I've tested it on multiple machines, i9's, Threadrippers, AMD GPUs and Nvidia GPUs, not only all high end, but the utmost top of their market. and all of them had the same fundamental lag problems, All of my friends online are playing the game and just putting up with it as well. It's not the equipment's fault, It's the engine of the game, when these lag spikes happen it's not the equipment being overwhelmed but being under utilized, the utilization of GPU's drops to 30% (whereas they'd normally be at 75-85 during regular gameplay) It's a problem with the game engine itself while loading new areas. You can find these hotspot locations and stand in them and your GPU will stabilize at 30% with low fps. I will not remove this review until this is patched, it's distracting and not only did it ruin my immersion, but It ruined my first experience of the game and now every time I think of playing it I feel a deep sinking feeling in my gut of trying to fix it for 10+ hours.I love Fromsoft games, but they cannot be allowed to continue to release butchered PC ports like this, they need to be held accountable and I don't know how that can happen. I wont remove this review until it's fixed.Beautiful Game, Absolutely gorgeous, I never thought I would love the look of any game as much as this. The graphics, environment, and feel were incredible for those short moments not interrupted by frustration and annoyance.",0
Negative,Its not good for PC unless you have a controller. The movement is terrible. The game stutters. I cannot in good conscious recommend this game to any PC player. What a huge disappointment,0
Negative,Typical FromSoftWare title over 1/3 of people buying this game on PC and like always the PC port is hot garbage Im so done with FromSoftWare on PC constant stuttering and no Ultrawide support.,0
Negative,Horrible port. Massive FPS drops for no reason on good hardware.,0
Negative,dogshit hitboxs waste of time unplayable honestly would rather play 10 league matches lose and 10 and probably would be more fun than playing this dogshit,0
Negative,"Wait for a patch for performance/optimization imo. Usually I'd say people just don't know how to tweak graphics settings, but I turned everything to low and still got bad frame drops and crashes. That's with a higher end PC too. I'll come back and revisit this review if they fix it.",0
Negative,"My god it's like if Shadow Of The Colossus and Dark Souls had some beautiful spawn. And while that may seem like paradise- for this game right now, it's a nightmare. I'm a huge fan of the SoulsBorne universe and have been for many, many years. However, this pc port is just a tad bit messy. The framerate drops often in open world areas often. Sometimes the framerate will drop even in enclosed areas but for but a moment. There's quite a bit of crashing in open world, and just as much while being summoned or invading. CONSTANT disruption in multiplayer as you'll be disconnected after just a few minutes. Please do yourself a favor and be wary of purchasing the game in its current state. I'm hoping FromSoft will be able to send patches ASAP.",0
Negative,"I'm sorry to say the release was not what the promotional videos made it out to seem.Terrible graphic performance, shocking controls. I'm glad Steam processed my refund so quickly.",0
Negative,"13 hours in. I take a warp gate in some random spot, and during the loading screen the game crashes. Whenever I try to load it again it crashes. I've spent an hour now looking up solutions with no luck. Honestly a complete turn off and by the time they fix my problem I will probably have beaten the game on another save file. Will not recommend because having the chance to lose hours of progress is not something I would wish to see on another person. 2 DAYS LATER: I made a new save. Made much more progress through the game. 20 hours in, I beat fire giant. There's a chain link bridge. When I try to cross it, it instantly crashes. Thanks.",0
Negative,"This review will be split into separate sections, the first going over the multitude of technical issues and the second being more opinionated. The first part alone is enough for a negative review in my book, so if you strongly disagree with my takes keep in mind that I'm not writing this only due to personal gameplay preferencesBUGS ENCOUNTERED: 1)Invisible horses2)Invisible legs (Specific armor pieces that refuse to show up)3)Invisible enemies in both my world and worlds I'm summoned to (yikes)4)Foliage which triggers a state of infinite inescapable freefall when jumped into5)Blue screened my computer once (I think this was connected to the previous glitch?)6)Low frames with good specs (I meet or exceed all recommended specs on my PC other than GPU, where I am still above the minimum. I'm playing on low settings and friends with even better PCs that exceed recommended on all levels have reported this as well.)7)Frame stutters (Separate from low frames, areas where they drop massively briefly altogether)8)Massive frame stutters and drops when big particle effects are on-screen (I'm on low settings as mentioned before)9)Crashing during loading screensOne of my friends crashes so frequently that they almost gave up entirely on trying to play the game. As of now the game still crashes for them10)Crashing PC entirely 11)Game not respawning me with full health12)Summoning players always results in an error (my connection is fine)13) Game randomly disconnects me while summoned to other worlds (again, my connection is fine and this never came up across all the other FromSoft games I've played on steam, including Dark Souls Remastered, Dark Souls 2 SOTFS, or Dark Soul 3 ) (Friends reported this happening to them as well)14) Easy Anti Cheat issues. I've personally never encountered these, but one of my friends reported being unable to play once due to the anti-cheat refusing to accept the fact that it was installed, and another just recently informed me they have to start the game twice in a row because the anti-cheat always fails the first time.15) if you don't want to call this a glitch, sure. I'm counting getting hit through fog walls as a design oversight. I think it's been in every game, and I'm getting sick of it.I don't care about development time. I don't care how many players are demanding the game to come out sooner. Finish your game. It has been, is, and always will be the most common belief among consumers that waiting longer for a better, finished game is always worth it. If you bite off more than you can chew and need another month, year, 3 years, more time to finish a game, say oops and finish the game. I'll wait.PERSONAL (NEGATIVE) OPINIONSI can't tell you what's fun and what's not. That's for you to decide. If you violently disagree with everything in this list I wouldn't question it, but as games are a subjective medium and I'm writing a game review, here are a couple of my takes:1)Lots of repeated bosses. I understand that this game is a lot bigger than previous ones, needs to fill the world, and that said previous games repeated bosses themselves, but I wasn't a fan when they did it and I'm even less of a fan of it here due to its sheer frequency.2)Lots of lazy bosses. When repeating a boss isn't enough they seem to have a fondness for just throwing previous bosses/enemies together in a room and calling it a new fight, synergy be damned. Also seen a fair bit of bosses that are just normal enemies with a bigger life pool.3)This one is definitely more personal, but I'm getting real sick of gang fights. If I get hit by an attack I can't see through the chest of a boss one more time I'm going to lose it. This game has a lot of gank bosses, which have always struck me as a cheap way of doing difficulty without having to design something new. I complained about bosses being thrown together as multiple enemies as lazy in my previous point, but what pisses me off more is that I always hate the resulting fights. Again, I know this is highly opinionated.4) more of an elaboration on my previous 2 comments: the Godskin Duo. spoilers if you haven't gotten to it yet, but the Godskin Duo is a fairly late game mandatory boss fight, which, as the name implies, is versus 2 enemies. I found this fight beyond insulting. Ignoring its immense difficulty, this (again, mandatory) fight takes 2 enemies already seen before within the world, throws them in a room, and says fuck you figure it out. The repetition and ganks annoyed me when I got to the end of a dungeon and found something I've already fought 3 times, but to compound them both into a mandatory fight so late in the game feels less like a product of having to fill a massive world, and more like a goddamn cop-out. Going back to its difficulty, this fight is way too hard. I know, I'm complaining about difficulty in a Fromsoft game, shoot me, but this was the first brick wall I faced, and knowing it was due to having two enemies clearly not tailored around a multitarget fight thrown in a small room for no real reason other than to have another boss fight stung. Maybe I was just underleveled but this boss has replaced the bed of chaos as my least favorite fight in the series.5) Smithing stone 1, Smithing stone 2, Smithing stone 3, Smithing stone 4, Smithing stone 5, Smithing stone 6, Smithing stone 7, Smithing stone 8 . I know this one's petty, but c'mon you've made unique names before I don't think it would take too much development time. Just feels lazy.6)If I never fight another asylum demon reskin in my life I will die a happy man.CONCLUSION: I don't actively hate this game. I've played a large portion of it and will continue to do so. Assuming the bugs are all fixed and some numbers are changed this would be a positive review. But ultimately they released a broken, unfinished game, with loads of repetition and game-breaking glitches, and as such, this review is staying negative for the foreseeable futureOverall 6/10 too much water.",0
Negative,"Ended up refunding. I've played all the dark souls and other titles by FromSoftware but wasn't a fan of the combat in this one. Horse combat was even worse for me as I couldn't connect many hits on enemies especially when lower/higher elevation came into play. The world looks beautiful but it can only do so much for me to want to play a game. I'm unsure if it was my controllers response time or because of stutter but dodging let me get hit more times than I can recall in any of the other titles. Good Graphics, Interesting Enemy models, Environment is beautiful",0
Negative,"Bad performances. Pretty heavy stutter, no ultrawide support, 60 fps locked. Will update if/once those issues get patched.",0
Negative,Another bad PC port.,0
Negative,"This is a robbery, and I will not release the ""Yes"" until my demands are met. 1. Better working conditions for the map button. Why would I ""G"" to show map and ""Q"" to make map go away. Stop this madness. My brain and my finger can't take these mental gymnastics. 2. 3440 X 1440 resolution without cropped edges. 3. Thinking more on the whole map situation. go ahead and redo all the UI because I didn't think it was possible to actually be more annoying than Red Dead.",0
Negative,With all the other known issues I just wanted to add on one more. you cant quit the game from in the game. you have to go back to the main menu and quit from there. This added 20 to 30 seconds to my rage quit time. its quite aggravating that in 2022 we still have to quit out to the main menu before quitting a game. alt f4 is also an option but my computer doesnt seem to like that to much and it takes even longer for the process to die when closed this way.,0
Negative,"I feel like I'd enjoy this game a lot, but the stuttering issues right now are overwhelmingly bad. Frames keep dropping to 10fps multiple times using above recommended specs on medium graphics. Maybe try to buy it when it's in a better state because at the moment is just a terrible port.",0
Negative,"Tool tips are all console buttons, game has no direction to follow initially. I'm sure its a great game long term but it was not well made for PC. Played for an hour trying to figure out what the purpose was and turned it off and requested a refund.",0
Negative,"This game is really pretty, and a lot of art work went into it. But the story doesn't make sense, and the concept feels rushed and slapped together. This really doesn't feel like a completed game, but a refined version of ""Hurry up and finish this game because we're running out of money!"" I was excited for this, but it seems like it missed. Requesting a refund.",0
Negative,"Stutters heavily, same as everyone else",0
Negative,PC Port is bad. Constant frame skipping.,0
Negative,"Keeps crashing. Make joining and being joined by friends needlessly difficult. Edit. And invisible enemies that are not supposed to be invisible. They still had shadows and the one's holding torches still had the torches animated.Edit The most common words in the game are ""unable to summon cooperator"" and "" error disconnected returning to your world""Edit: I feel I have spent far more time waiting and trying to solve bugs than actually playing. Furthermore now I have one file that when summoned even by a host higher level than me I do roughly half damage. If you want co op or to consistently see what you are fighting go back to dark souls 3.Edit: seamless coop and the game becomes thump up",0
Negative,"See below for old reviewSo updated review, i managed to get it working by disabling ""Microsoft Device Association Root Enumerator"" in the device manager, which is a hilarious fix and somewhat embarrassing that this somehow affects their game engine.the game itself in here is a absolute gem, I'm loving it so far and if it wasn't for the host of issues with the PC port id wholeheartedly recommend it.However it is another in a long line of shitty From Soft PC ports, not to mention their apparent refusal to hire a competent UI designer (inventory is a mess). So if you are willing to deal with traditional FromSoft PC jank then there is a great game here, but i don't think its for everyone.-Would love to play but with an i9, RTX 3080 and 64GB ram it somehow couldn't be bothered to run properly, stutters make fighting anything beyond trash mobs functionally impossiblegive this one a pass on PC until if/when they fix it.",0

Negative,"AAA Game. Doesn't work. I work as a systems admin and threw the book at this application, treating it more like one of the tickets I get across my desk than a game.

Take a cue from CDProjekt and learn to not release a game before it's done.",0
Negative,"I am sad to have to leave a negative review on such a beloved franchise, but this pc port is not functioning as it should. I am one of the people who have well over the recommended specs, and the game is still a stuttery mess no matter how many hours I spend tweaking settings in control panel or windows. Until this issue is fixed, I will be playing the ps5 version and I will change to positive, if they even are addressed.",0
Negative,"I was hoping for a game with functional coop, but what can I expect from a AAA studio in 2022?Apart from that, I'm ready to get stuck in to more Dark Souls.EDIT: coop is still broken.

Negative,good game bad frames,0
Negative,Decent game but it really suffers from being open world rather than benefits.,0
Negative,"The game is beautiful, the soundtrack is dope, boss mechanics have been really good so far and there are a lot of things to do in the game (you won't get bored) but there are some serious issues that need to be addressed ASAP. The first one is input lag.Man it's annoying.You press the button at the proper timing and nothing happens.Then you get hit and your character starts rolling even though you pressed the button one time and obviously you roll into a second hit.It's noticeable in boss fights with bosses that have lots of combos or when you fight many enemies simultaneously. You get hit once because the input was delayed/buffered even though you pressed at the right time and then you get a roll fest. Second issue is performance. My GPU is a quite old at this point ( 1060 6GB) but while the game runs smoothly in enclosed areas on medium graphics, when you are outside it's just a stutter fest. And it seems a lot of people have this problem with way better rigs than mine. I was one of the lucky ones and it's not unplayable but it's not a smooth experience either performance wise. I also think there is a bug where when you retrieve your ""souls"" after dying, SOMETIMES you get less than you originally had. Don't know if it's indeed a bug or I was just too tired but I'll update when I'm sure. I really can't recommend Elden Ring right now because of the problems listed above.Update 1: The thing about losing souls when you retrieve them after dying; it's not a bug. It's something else.Update 2: The developers need to fix this ASAP because it's absolutely frustrating if it happens. I started playing online and for the one second my net dropped, I had to start over a boss that was almost dead. THIS IS ATROCIOUSUpdate 3: I've put a lot more hours into the game and there are a lot of re-sused assets and bosses just with a different affinity. I mean sure there are many dungeons and a variety of bosses but some just get re-used way too much. I'm tired of battling Erdtree avatars with an addition of fire abilities or lightning on top of the normal ones you fight at the start of the game. And that's just an example. Obviously I didn't expect EVERY dungeon to have a unique boss but it gets tiring to fight the same enemies over and over and over. It's just a re-skin.Update 4: With a new graphics card ( 3060) the game still performs terribly. Immense stuttering and many frame drops. It's clearly not optimized properly AT ALL!",0
Negative,Absolutely atrocious performance. Will change my review once fixed.,0
Negative,"NO ULTRAWIDE SUPPORT ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!Lots of frame drops, fingers crossed for a patch soon to address these issues and maybe I'll recommend.",0
Negative,I think I'd love this game if it didn't stutter all the time.,0
Negative,"DO NOT BUY! This is the worst port to PC I have ever seen. Its literally barely playable.

Negative,"Edit: Changed my review to not recommended after buying a new monitor and finding out Elden Ring doesn't support my native resolution (and probably never will).If you are part of ultrawide master race: Don't buy this. Elden Ring renders at utlra wide resolutions (like all modern games should), but places black bars to limit your view. I suppose it's done for balance reasons, but it's a sad excuse. Shame since the game is really beautiful in UW (sometimes it takes a while for the black bars to render and you get to see how the game actually should look on your screen).If you own a regular 16:9 or 16:10 display, check my original review:Best game of the year 2022Best open world game 2022Best souls like 2022Best George R.

Negative,"100% awful QA on the keyboard experience, game is basically unplayable until significant time is spent adjusting configs in menus to even remotely be considered a keyboard capable game.Something about the art just looks off, it tries to be very 'grand' but falls flat and looks grainy, even pixelated and fake in a drab way. The forced perspective is awkward, the vastly ignored sensitivity of the mouse controlled camera only speaks to the lack of testing and support for actual PCs the game got. Just playing the game gives me a headache.",0
Negative,"It's really hard to not recommend if you're like me and look for ""that"" feeling in a game: I can rarely find it in books. A grand adventure, like the Lord of the Rings but bigger and better and far more serious. It's not hard to recommend because this game absolutely has that. It's great like that.No, this is hard to recommend because of the same things everyone else are reporting:1) 60 FPS lock. It's 2022 and the game isn't really supremely heavy on the system. 60 FPS I am sure is a limitation of the engine but I think for a premium price, gamers deserve more2) Visually, I see zero difference from any of the recent FROM SOFTWARE games. Sekiro, even Dark Souls 3. Maybe it's debatable but I see absolutely zero improvement in graphics for a game so many years more recent.3) Frame drops. See item 1) and 2). A high-end machine should not have frame drops on this game. It is purely optimisation.but for me, the worst.4) No ultrawide support. WHY? It's even an option in the graphics setting. You can totally choose your ultrawide resolution. And you know what you get? Black bars on both sides. Premium, immersive screen real-estate that's simply not provided because this developer didn't feel we deserve the time or effort.I regret purchasing this in a way that is non-refundable because, even though I actually adore the game itself, these features need to be pushed back on the publishers to say they need to supply us with a certain standard that is simply not being met.Again, these can easily be fixed with very minor patching (apparently someone has already made a mod that lets you go ultrawide. how on Earth is this NOT supported?) but whether they do it or not, is another story.",0
Negative,"false advertising as a coop game with catastrophically complicated and convoluted coop mechanics from the last decade, which connects ""phantoms"" of player characters and kicks them out when they die or the host dies, just to let players reorganize the coop session again and again. i would be ashamed to even call this a ""coop"" mode. this is a ""phantom assistant summoning simulator"" at best.movement doesnt feel fluid enough for a game of the current generation, where reaction time matters and it just feels like a copy and paste from their previous dark souls games. gameplay mechanics come from more than a decade ago, literally. with a bit of optimization here and there, maybe. still feels outdated just the same. same with character visuals and animations. movement feels sluggish, slow and clumsy - like its from a decade ago, funny enough.totally overhyped dark souls copy in gameplay and coop mechanics, apart from the added sorcery.on top of that, it just has bad performance on high end pc rigs, which seem to be caused by the anti cheat system they implemented. 60 fps locked in 2022 on pc is unacceptable and there is no excuse for locking it. micro-stuttering on top as well as frequent fps drops while running it on a 3080.if that doesnt bother you, have fun playing the game. im very sure as a fan of from soft games you'll have a blast with recycled and outdated gameplay mechanics.",0
Negative,"If you plan to/don't mind using a controller and a standard 16:9 ration screen, go for this if you enjoyed the Dark Souls experience.Right now getting around the latter disables your ability to play the coop piece. So if you have a wider or taller than normal monitor you don't get to use it. If you have the option, I would recommend just getting the console version since you are probably going to have a better experience and not have to deal with any of the issues with the PC release for this.In my opinion, this should have never been released on PC without it being made explicitly clear they expect you to be limited to a console level experience as the best you can expect. As it stands, after releasing as many well known games as they have, they really have no excuse for releasing something like this on PC.Even Cyberpunk 2077 was miles ahead for its PC release and I would be the first to admit that was a buggy mess. I just don't see FromSoftware actually putting any effort to making this a better experience and based on their Dark Souls port and this, I won't waste time hoping they might do better.",0
Negative,"Currently not recommending due to performance issues.Stuttering and frame drops fairly consistently.cpu usage falls to 10-15% when these happen.None of the fixes have helpedEdit 9th March 2022 - The patch on Friday the 4th of March 2022, has caused even more issues, including game crashes which weren't previously thereEdit 11th March 2022 - The cause of the freezing/lag I have is due to Dx12, and is inherent in the games engine from soft would've known about this months agoEdit 26th March 2022 - We are now a full 32 days since the games initial release date and the Dx12 lag issues are still not fixed, FromSoftware knew about these issues months before release and did nothing, will this game ever be fixed on PC?

The game however is magical and an irresistible masterpiece, even in its current and less that perfect form.Original:Got to agree with the disappointment. Getting a ton of stuttering and the idea that ""Oh it won't be there the next time you see the enemy or area"" is not really very reassuring. The first time seeing them is pretty damn important!Seems like a great game though, hope it's all hands on deck sorting it out and not just brushed aside like it seems these games have been on PC in the past.

Negative,Not worth it for PC atleast. The game runs great but the controls are dog shit. Everything is defaulted for Xbox controller.

Negative,"This game is very laggy/instable atm, im playing on a r5 3600x, 16GB DDR4 3333Mhz, Geforce RTX 2070S and using a HDD to play this game on. Im experiencing lag spikes at the moment and sometimes, I get as low as 30 FPS for some seconds, screen freeze for 0.2s or 30FPS for some moments and all that about every 5-10 seconds. Sadly not a very enjoyable experience. I first played on high, then I experienced this and I updated my drivers and my settings set to medium, still the same and I wouldn't think low would do the trick.I really like the looks and gameplay of the whole game, concept is nice, new features are nice too, just a little rocky atm since lots isnt known yet about elden ring, I'm playing a sorcerer atm and I still carry my beginners staff since the beginning and needed to grind about 2 hours just to finish up the first boss at the top of the starting area( I did do some other things too and didnt head straight to the boss). I'm dealing some damage and some bosses take learning but I dont find it very pleasing that you have to grind before progressing, which is fine unless its your first real ""main"" boss. I'm talking ""Margit"" here.It's very random when you get what and can't really rely on finding certain stuff u need unless u follow a guide in the future that shows you where to get your things and not wander around in the open world searching aimlessly and finding all the stuff you dont need. All in all, I can recommend this game but not at this exact moment. Game needs to be fixed.",0
Negative,"Looks like 90% or more of the negative reviews are about the performance issues. I guess I got really lucky because I have a 1070 and a ryzen 3800X and my game only rarely stutters in a couple specific spots, otherwise it's a smooth 50-60 fps on high graphics.I'm putting in a positive review because the game is playable for me, and it's pretty incredible.Edit on Feb 28th: I've experienced more of my friends' inability to even play the game due to technical issues, and the disconnection problem among those of us who can play are pretty severe, I feel I was being too lenient. I am changing to a negative review until they are fixed.Edit on March 2nd: I guess I'll put my other complaints here as well. 1) Holding the change equipment button to cycle back to the first one is too slow, and I don't know how to speed it up. I've actually died waiting for it to cycle while holding the button because it took so long to get to my flask.2) Can't summon after all area bosses are defeated. They really didn't change it for an open world game? There's so much to explore in an area even without the boss, that really feels wrong. This goes hand in hand with how they took away the third phantom that they had in DS3. Co-op is more limited than before. 3) Because left and right on the Dpad are both changing weapons and cycling through messages on the ground, I have found myself, in combat, unable to change my weapon/shield because I've been over a bloodstain and a message. I have no idea if this has been in other souls games, but I've only noticed it now. It's infuriating.Still, the game is beautiful, the gameplay is great, hitboxes are good, and when we're not being disconnected the actual reactivity of pvp and coop feels good, haven't had very many laggy invaders. March 2nd addendum- Twice now, today, an invader has invaded, not seen the host, and left. I just figured out that it's because the host hasn't loaded for the invader. They think there's no one there. Or there's a hunter fighting them, both of which my friend the host couldn't see. So never mind about the good netcode.Addendum 2- We can no longer summon each other near the weeping island erdtree despite the boss still being alive. We have to summon from a far off bonfire and run all the way there. :Shrug:End of March 2nd edit.Edit on March 5thMy friend was literally temporarily banned from multiplayer play because he was disconnected so many times by the game. Awful, infuriating, unacceptable.Final edit on March 18th. With patch 1.03, they have made some balance changes, that's fine. They fixed some of the performance issues, that's good. They still have not mentioned the multiplayer issues, that's terrible. And lastly, they added in the rest of certain NPC questlines. My friend predicted correctly, they were released unfinished. Don't know why I had higher expectations, but like a lot of other AAA games it was released unfinished to be finished later. This review will therefore stay negative forever.",0
Negative,"It's a buggy launch. And at this time I can't recommend the game until fromsoftware patches the issues. I've spent more time on the game menu screen than playing it.

Crashed once more in the open world. I was able to get a decent amount of gameplay in as well as update the keybinding to something to my liking.

Negative,"I don t like Elden Ring. I am not going to say it is a bad game per se, but it is a game that has wildly diverged from my interests in the genre of action RPGs. I do think it is the culmination of FromSoft s increasingly bad design practices and that it lost a lot of what made the Dark Souls games stronger.It has been praised immensely for its open world, but I really can t understand why. It is virtually no different than any other open world game with tons of recycled, cookie cutter content. There is so much repetition in the environments, especially anything outside of the Legacy Dungeons, which are few and far between. And so many of the dungeons lead to useless things that have no bearing on your progression as well, so they feel meaningless to even engage with. Why bother going into the innumerable forts/dungeons/caves/whatever if they all look and play the same with endlessly repeated bosses all to get some useless trinket? We lost the beautiful worlds and wonderfully realized levels of Dark Souls 1 and 2 for this. It wasn t an improvement. It was a major blow to what was one of the strongest aspects of FromSoft games. The combat is just too simplistic. It is just way too damn simplistic, which is great for luring in new people, but when I ve played this exact same game for nearly a decade and a half, it has grown STALE! There s no combos. There s no complex game mechanics to interact with. It is just R1/R2 and dodge. Maybe a parry. That s it. Compared and contrasted to games like Nioh and Monster Hunter, it is just woefully unsatisfying. And with the way FromSoft s design philosophy has changed, you spend so much time on the defensive just waiting to be able to attack an enemy that spends forever in an uninterruptible combo. It is just so passive compared to the ultra aggressive gameplay of the other games I mentioned. Sekiro was a great divergence from this philosophy where aggression was greatly rewarded even if the combat was simple.In terms of story, which isn t exactly something that really matters all that much in these games, I do think it is much weaker than Dark Souls was. The central motif of struggling in the face of a dead and dying world in the hope of changing it. And that struggle is perfectly personified in the Chosen Undead and their endless deaths in pursuit of that. It just worked beautifully. And the obscure storytelling that was mostly told by the world itself and sparse interactions with NPCs was pretty much perfectly done. In contrast the struggle in Elden Ring just isn t compelling by comparison. I never felt connected to its world like I did with Dark Souls. And FromSoft really doubled down on making everything even more obtuse and obscured because We re FromSoft and that s what we do! And it is made worse by the open world and the lack of coherent design outside of the Legacy Dungeons. I wish I liked the game more, but I just don t. I just don t think the FromSoft formula works for me anymore. And it is especially hampered by a generic open world that robs one of the greatest strengths of FromSoft. I need more from my action RPGs these days and Elden Ring simply doesn t deliver.",0

Negative,Disappointingly bad pc port. It's probably #2 to Cyberpunk in terms of how bad it runs on my pc which fits in between the minimum and recommended requirements for both games. In terms of actual gameplay it's really solid so far but I doubt I'm going to play much more until I upgrade my pc because my framerate dropping from close to 60 to sub 30 every 20 seconds is just not gonna cut it. Apparently these performance issues are also very prevalent on consoles which leads me to believe there's a ceiling on how much they can rectify this dismal performance.,0
Negative,"Still too many problems unfixed.Also, fix your fucking multiplayer. The level of inconsistency is fucking ridiculous.Edit:Minor improvements have been made. So minor that they are almost not noticed. Every update seems to greatly favor invaders, to the point that even attempting to summon a co-op now, will immediately get you invaded. All the while, the co-op gets disconnected and you get stuck with the dirty aftertaste. Overall, it's a complete let down. The networking is a joke, the stability STILL isn't there. Just a stray thought - try Nioh 2(Relative game type) style of multiplayer, meet at some location(OMG a real use for the round table!), start an expedition(Can FULLY explore a set segment of the map! Rather than having annoying ass fog walls{lazy asses}), invaders can still invade(FAPFAPFAPFAP) {btw I don't hate invaders, just hate not being able to co-op when I feel like it}, everybody enjoys a significant improvement. Disconnects might still happen but, the overall feel would be much better.Oh and a big heads up.might try paying the fuck attention to your players.we kinda pay your bills. Just FYI",0
Negative,"Game in 2022 that doesn't support ultrawide on-top of that in the previous titles modders made fixes for the ultrawide issues, but this time they included easy anti-cheat so if we want to mod the game we get stranded in offline mode.Not everyone is trying to cheat in your game some people just want to enjoy the scenic view experience that an ultrawide monitor provides, there is no argument to be made here why you didn't implement ultrawide support modders did it in a day and a wider monitor does not provide any advantages in online play invasions this is not a damn FPS game. Disappointing.Not to mention all the crashes and connection issues while trying to play with my friends",0
Negative,"Open World ruins yet another series. This is just Dark Souls but bad because instead of a polished, tight set of areas that you can play through and enjoy with bosses that are tuned for your power level in those areas, it's another game that replaces progression with farming.The biggest issue is there's no sense of progress, indicator of progress, or any way to clearly make progress. They clearly expect you to follow the big glowing arrow to start, hit the first real boss which is a huge wall, then give up and explore the accessible portion of the open world to its exhaustion to gain some power/gear to fight the first boss with.The bosses: All the bosses other than mini dungeons are have very random attack patterns that don't reward skill, replacing that with learning which 2 of the 25 different attacks are ""safe"" to punish, leading to 30-40 minute fights where all you do is play keepaway until you see the correct tell and can do 1-2 hits worth of damage. Roll away, dodge for another 30-60 seconds until you see an opening, repeat.The open world: It's empty feeling and yet too crowded all at the same time. Foliage is everywhere, blocking lines of sight and horse movement, hiding cliffs and hazards, and yet the enemies are clumped up, very clearly grouped by zone. Here's the poison puffer swamp, with crab. Here's the Castle Soldier Area. Here's the Wolf Zone. Between them? Nothing except rocks and trees. Maybe you'll get lucky and find a 2-room cave with a boss (that has no loot)!The controls remain as always on PC, painful. They actually regressed from Dark Souls 3 - that game at least showed the key help properly when you pressed a keyboard key instead of needing to change the prompt display in the settings.",0
Negative,"Potential to be great, but as it is I can NOT give this game a solid review. Atleast on PC. Until there is a patch to fix the stuttering in the overworld, invisible enemies, random crashing at startup, on top of the plethora of other bugs and issues seen and documented here and elsewhere on the internet, I would pass on this title. Game is absolutely gorgeous and in the event the PC port is fixed I have no doubt it will be a 10/10, just a shame the PC release was god awful.",0

Negative,"It hurts to leave a negative review on Elden Ring, considering I've been following the game since it was first announced in 2019 and I'm a huge fromsoft fan.But this port just isn't good. The performance in the open world isn't good but I'm not complaining too much considering my pc is quite old but reports of stuttering even on very powerful systems is ridiculous and framerate drops are noticeable in the open world for me too.Honestly my biggest complaint is how bad mouse + keyboard controls are implemented. It fixes nothing from ds3 and regresses in a key area. Sensitivity is still way too high even at 0, prompts are still for controller by default and worst of all (something that wasn't a problem in ds3), there are inputs that are impossible to rebind like opening map and navigating menus. It sounds like a small issue but it really makes the game a lot less enjoyable. I'm confident I will rewrite my review later once fixes have been implemented, but the game should never have been in this state to begin.Its frustrating that From nailed the gameplay, environment, art ect, but fell at the last hurdle of making a respectable port.",0

This does affect combat and bossfights - elden ring is a challenging action rpg so fluidity in combat is very important, so having these technical ""hicups"" is unacceptable. I can deal with lower framerates in some titles but of all the games out there Elden rings experience suffers heavily under these stutters. Im sure theres an amazing experience buried here but I honestly cant enjoy the game in its current state. I can play red dead 2 on ultra with stable 60 fps, so its a joke that this game doesnt run properly.",0
Negative,"Ran fine on my middle of the road machine. So I don't get all the fuss about performance. But I was bored. I played for about 40 minutes and did nothing.

Then, finally, some action, your dead, cut scene, boo. Stand up, smash some more containers, listen to a couple NPCs says nothing, wander around and see a guy on a horse. Sweet some more action. Oh, well he's a boss or something and now you are dead. I'll have my $66 back, thanks. I guess if you are into this series you already expect this.

Negative,"The definition of overhyped trash. An unoptimized PC port which doesn't even work on some high end GPUs. Huge amounts of PC players can't even run the game without stuttering or issues. Just hire Durante already FROM SOFT, this sh*t is unacceptable in 2022. Buggy garbage. Expect to be locked out of ever completing major stuff in game due to bugs, like important bosses not spawning. A large amount of people have these bugs, but FROM is lazy so they will never be fixed. I have also seen clips of people randomly beating bosses on full HP due to bugs, ruining their satisfaction of finally beating the boss themselves after many attempts of progression, bricking their save. I wish we had the option of reloading a previous save to fix game breaking bugs, but that is not an option.And don't even think of forcefully fixing issues with cheat engine or the like, you'll get a VAC ban because of the bloated anti-cheat garbage the game uses, which is probably whats responsible for all the optimization issues. Worst questing out of any game ever made. You need to look them up online to even find where quests start, due to extremely subtle breadcrumbs that start them. You'll then do it again to progress the quest itself, since the quest NPCs will teleport around the map with no hints as to where they went. While looking up the quests you WILL be spoiled, as the only websites remotely up to date and decent for information are garbage wikis like Fextralife. The game punishes exploration by having quest NPCs randomly die if you explore too much, locking you out of their quests with important worldbuilding and lore. So choose to either spoil yourself or miss out on 90% of the game's story. You won't be able to do the quests by playing blind, even if you dedicate hours searching the map for them like me. They're made under the assumption that you'll have to read a wiki of collected information from thousands of players to find out what to do, and yet they are also narratively driven enough to have twists that are easily spoiled. FROM's outdated questing system is completely at odds with an open world game. Story is horrendously bad, let us not forget how bad the final parts of GoT were. But people forgive ER because muh Ranni waifu, Though I can see why they simp for her, she's the only NPC in game who gets ANY character development. And pretty much the only one that doesn't die or betray you. Maybe if all the unfinished characters had their proper story arcs, and if Jarlburg wasn't cut it would be different, but who knows. And don't get me started on characters like Melina, who most people forgot existed after the first hour of the game. Lots of wonderful characterization there, and I'm supposed to care when she randomly sets herself on fire at the end ? At least Ranni's quest is complete, the supposed most important female sidekick in game who helps your character might as well not exist, since she has no development or story.If you outsmart the game by doing the only ending where she doesn't die, then remove the frenzied flame with the needle so you free yourself from that bad ending, the game doesn't even recognize it and she won't react to you sparing her life. A case of players being smarter than the game devs. This game is a RUSHED product with massive amounts of cut story content. Which is ironic because the quests themselves were barebones with next to no effort put in. Most quests are just talking to NPCs at different locations or fetching an item, and yet nearly all of them end abruptly with no conclusion, but were left ingame unfinished for some reason.Dataminers have found out that about 75% of quests in game are unfinished, and have cut dialogue and content. The voice recordings for the cut content are all in the game such as important lore for Nepheli and Kenneth Haight. They will most likely sell that cut content back to you via DLC. Gameplay is enjoyable for a while, but mostly unbalanced and untested. Some stats don't even scale properly, and leveling a weapon from 24 to 25 is a downgrade in damage. Too many weapons are absurdly OP and unbalanced. Some bosses are a complete joke and I could beat them with my eyes closed, while some random overworld monsters have absolutely no downtime in their attacks and stagger every hit, and are harder than 99% of the bosses in the game. A NPC pack with dogs and rats being harder than bosses is pretty stupid. Same with revenants unless you cheese them with heals.Ashes of war are completely unbalanced and some do 1000 damage, while others do sub 100. Incantations look cool but have big cast times so are useless in any form of hard content, you could just go INT with faster cast times but boring skills, and kill bosses in two casts of comet azur. Stuff like bleed is too overpowered and a necessity to beat anything with a big HP pool. Hoarfrost, bloodhound attack, transient moonlight etc break the game's difficulty, and summons like Mimic and Jellyfish are too strong. If you want any challenge at all you can't summon ashes or use broken weapons. All in all it's a rushed game and could've been a lot better with just some polish, or basically if they just kept in all the cut content. The graphics do look very good and the OST has some good tracks. Sadly though there is too many problems which will just filter you. I Can't even play it anymore without feeling disillusioned because I enjoyed it at first. Most of the issues happen post Limgrave, which is the first zone and the most polished. New players are in for a world of bugs and problems after moving out of the first zone, which is all the more sadistic since Limgrave is relatively a bug free, enjoyable experience that gets your hopes up for the rest of the game. They will need a massive overhaul patch plus bug fixes and optimizations before I even think to touch it again. But if that happens in the form of a paid DLC, then they can get fu**ed,",0

This is just bad if you cant make game properly let people fix it for you any way how I can in 5 min make this game to work in ultra wide and big studio with professional developers can't.Good gameplay good boss fights but this is still not triple A game as to get good visuals on wide screens will ban you so you can't play with friends.",0
Negative,Great game mechanically but the quality of the performance is beyond unacceptable. There cannot be any justification for how awful the game runs. In no case should a game locked to 60 FPS experience significant trouble on high end hardware. Wildly embarrassing performance out of an otherwise excellent game.,0
Negative,"this game feels like a crap PC port from a few years ago. 60 frame lock on on PC. this is disappointing and not what i expect from a full price tag they don't even change the tutorial from a Xbox control layout. You have to constantly look up key binds honestly not a big deal i play with a controller anyway ,but when you couple it with the performance issues it all just feels lazy and rushed. for referance i have a 3070 with a 5800x up to date drivers. Im still seeing performance drops even at medium settings. This should have been delayed. This game was only made for consoles in mind and is only acceptable if you're playing from such. I'm refunding this and only going to pick it back up with a sale if you have seen the mixed review tag and are on the fence with the purchase honestly wait for a sale.",0
Negative,"Game is really great, running maxed out 1080p 60FPS on R7 1700, 16GB 3000MHz, 1660 Ti. I do have some stuttering occasionally when I ride the horse but otherwise the game is amazing.Original review above when I had 4 hours of playtime.EDITED REVIEW at 25 hours playtime:The game is great and mostly playable but the servers coming down right now made me want to revise this to do not reccommend. -The stutters have gotten worse and seem to happen randomly even in boss fights and non horse sections/dungeons. -Trying to summon people always come up with ""unable to summon"" probably 10 times before being successful-Random disconnects when i'm playing with friends or as a summon maybe 50% of all my summons, including in boss fights-One boss fight is glitched, spent maybe 2 hours yesterday trying to fix it (The one with the lady in the force field)-Hard crashes maybe 6 times in my 25 hours, at all the worst times.-The game stays open for a few minutes after I quit and can be annoying to really stop especially in big picture modeDespite all these things the game is great but I would definitely wait to buy this game for a month or a few. Shame games are like this these days. Release now fix later, and the critic reviews generally don't reflect this stuff.",0
Negative,"This game feels like it was built for a console and ported to PC. The keyboard/mouse controls are lousy and the game, even on PC, keeps referring to clicking A or B buttons. Using things like spells and potions require that you pick your entire hand up and click several things before accessing what you want. This makes using things like potions or spells in fights nearly impossible unless you have a 3rd arm. Beyond that, performance issues abound. Some of the NPCs are somewhat interesting, most are not. Just overall. meh. There are lots of other, more engaging and better done games out there to spend time on.",0
Negative,The controls on PC are an absolute joke.,0
Negative,Can't log into game servers for a single player game. Japanese/10 PC port.,0

Negative,game for playstation doesn't have ps button maps on pc lazy fucking devs,0
Negative,"This is not ""Elden Ring"". This is another dark souls. Same NPC's that don't use MP, same trash camera since dark souls( maybe even demon souls?) , same rpg elements. Sekiro was different. It deserved to be game of the year.This game has really poor optimization, you can barely connect with friends because there are always network problems( P2P lmao), the enemies are laggy as fuck on the rare occasion when coop actually works.Also Easy AntiCheat? Really?",0
Negative,"For what it s worth, I got a pretty standard mid-range rig with an i7 and a 1080 and I can run it on high, no stuttering with a solid 60 fps without doing anything special. Reading all other reviews though your mileage may vary, so maybe wait a bit until you buy it. Other than that - game s good. Not sure if it s better or worse than Dark Souls yet - It s definitely different though.EDIT: Scratch that, performance has deteriorated immensely and it s not as good as Dark Souls imo. It crashes constantly as well, and some weapons are somehow just bugged. Just hold out on it for a while.",0
Negative,"finished this game from start to finish and did all the extra stuff I enjoy from soft games and have played all of them.would i reccomend this game.honestly NO it is boring the lore and story is just not interesting everyone is a god or a demi god or some sort of importance so no one is important because everyone is important open world is really not something new and great anymore we have had open world games since the PS2 now so a open world game now is nothing that mind blowingi would say i enjoyed the first half of the game its well designed and firm but fair but the second half of the game was just painful and eye rolling, every death just felt.well yawn. and making a boss kill you in one hit is not difficult but rather makes me go to sleep, when compared to the other titles of from softbasically sometimes less is more.and this game just went with quantity over quality IMO just watch some of this on you tube don't actually bother with it",0
Negative,"pretty much what i asked for and was expecting . so faredit : about a week into it and i cant say i like it that much. the dungeon exploration aspect i liked so much about dark soul 3 is replaced with an open world but the creatures in the world offer no challenge. the bosses however are walls of brick harder than in DS3edit edit : after getting further into the game, it got better and im having fun3rd edit : after now 124h of play time, i can say this is the best s**t ever, even tho its not perfect4th edit : sides quests are so bad. all the NPCs just die because i fail to do exactly what im supposed to and when im supposed to. just very very bad. and the main quest is just ""kill bosses"". no story, no involvement. just a bunch of useless items and some monsters. thats what this game is.",0
Negative,seemingly incredible game held back by some of the worst pc optimization in all of history,0
Negative,"Lots of weird finger stuff. I let the hype sell me on this one, but it's just a Dark Souls game. If that's your thing (or you like finger stuff) you'll probably love it.",0
Negative,terrible port.stuttering is bad. key mapping is . kill that person.even mouse in main menu can stutter more than game itself.,0
Negative,"I am gonna leave a dislike until game is playable, its beyond broken. I am fine fine some frame drops or some glitches but game literally slows down in boss fights, i feel like i am playing super hot.",0
Negative,just another souls game. nothing new. 10/10 doesnt make sense to me,0
Negative,Returned after 26 minutes of play. If I wanted to play with a controller I would buy a console. Terrible key/mouse support and shitty performance. Maybe 6 months down the road this will be playable.,0
Negative,"Invisible enemy bug makes this game unplayable, wait until they fix it.EDIT: I'll add to the list of bugs the reliable disconnects 30 seconds after summoning a friend, or simply ""Unable to summon cooperator"" error as soon as I touch a sign.A month in and the game is still a broken mess.EDIT: Greatly improved in almost a year. No more invisible enemy, better performance but the multiplayer is still broken. I still get disconnected and get my friends dropped during boss fights.",0
Negative,The games stutters every time the enemy moves or attacks on all graphic settings. I am running on Ryzen 9 5900X and RX 6800 XT and 32GB RAM. This already happens in first actual boss (tree sentinel). Cannot get pass due to unplayable stutter.,0
Negative,If only there wasn't so much stutter.,0

Negative,"The anti-cheat lags the game and unless you go into offline mode, cutting yourself from the most interesting content of the game, you will get performance issues.EDIT: I was able to fix EAC after a lot of troubleshooting. I should not have to do this.",0
Negative,terrible port input is delayed and input queuing is too aggressive.i love the gameplay but the mouse and keyboard controls are shit and auto lock on keeps prioritizing the farthest thing on your screen and keeps changing constantly when mouse is moved even just a micrometer and the input queuing is terrible and forces character to do last action pressed even after flinching EDIT:after the latest update lock on issue on mouse is still broken along with other bugsgame keeps crashing after every other summon what the hell is this game breaking shit fix that shit :|,0
Negative,"Give this Game a Cookie, cuz it's sad.Welcome Lads, it's 2022 and we got a good 'ol Soulsgame with Open World.It also came without Ultrawide Support, even with FROM giving us Dark GOAT Remastered with 21:9.This Game features immense stuttering and Framedrops aswell.5/7 Highest difficulty of all the mighty Soulsgames ever!

Negative,"I had high hopes for this game, but I'm extremely disappointed, frames drops are too frequent, try to use even the lowest graphic options but didn't help at all, and the worse part is that all enemies are turning invisible for some reason, how I'm supposed to parry or roll when I can't see anything.",0
Negative,"1. Game is stuttering because I think it is capped at 60 FPS. Which makes it feel super stuttery and not smooth at all. 2 The game is tailored for Console users. So if you are a PC player like me, you will be forced to use this weird system that is mainly controller use through mouse and keyboard use. it's hard to explain but it's super confusing while playing the game and breaks the game for me. 3. I am absolutely stunned these devs did not tailor make this title for console players and for PC players separately. 4. I just did a refund request on Steam. I can't deal with these issues. If you can't make a game that suits me as a PC player you do not deserve my money. You lazy bums.",0

Negative,"I had to manually troubleshoot and fix the easy anti-cheat because it was improperly installed or somesuch, just to start playing the game I paid triple-a price for. fix your mess yourselves next time, fromsoft, or dont use ANY drm beyond steam itself as a rule of thumb.",0
Negative,"FROM has always had a rough PC port experience. It speaks volumes that their best go was DS:R - outsourced to a different company. Unfortunately Elden Ring in its current state is unplayed. It's a beautiful game, the freedom to explore is very welcome and a good next step for the developers.Unfortunately despite running Game Ready Drivers, forcing high performance mode, and changing power plans, the inconsistent performance leading to stuttering makes the core gameplay - combat - frustrating and nigh impossible. Long load times despite a quality NVMe SSD, 60fps lock, no ultrawide, no primary display setting, all amount to an inexcusabley terrible PC port. This takes me back to DS: PTDE. I'd have hoped FROM had grown from then but apparently not.",0
Negative,"Gameplay is fun, but there are definitely some technical issues with the game. Especially in outdoor areas, but also when entering/exiting a building there are huge frame drops. It ruins a few fights currently. Also, some of the controls feel laggy compared to other Souls games (there's a strange delay before dodging and parrying that makes timing much different. Still doable, but it takes some getting used to.)I can still partly recommend it, but will have to say no ""for now"" hoping they fix the launch issues.Update as of 2022/3/14: No improvement in the framerate drops.",0
Negative,"Where to begin? I started doing much research and watching hours of developer streaming content. I understood having both a PS4 and a PC that the controller was most likely the best way to go for movement speed, frequent dodging, and skill use. However, upon playing the title right at launch, my controller, which is a PS4 controller, worked all through character creation. Once I got to the point where I could go into the tutorial, ALL of the prompts were for Xbox. I rushed the entry levels to get to a point where I could change settings, and nothing worked. I force changed my Steam settings and tried THREE controllers before giving up and moving to my keyboard and mouse. And yet somehow, this made it all worse. For PC keyboard and mouse users. The keybinds are garbage; the flow of dodging, blocking, and attacking are awful unless you have seven fingers on one hand. I gave up not doing much of anything other than running from even entry-level NPCs. I have played everything as recent as New World and as old as the Souls games. The level of how foreign it was without moving seamlessly between items, inventory, or quick menus was frustrating. Having no FPS issues with any recently released games, Elden Ring reeeeeeeaaallly makes you work for it. As for multiplayer and co-op, two of my friends from New World and I linked up and played co-op. This became entirely too difficult to figure out, and once we did, we realized there was an extremely lazy effort to allow players to support each other: no shared loot or trading, no real prolonged group or co-op play. You are summoned to your co-players world but cannot use many of your skills like your mount, your spirits, and other such items. Only the group host can access your inventory and bag items, loot, or in-world materials, making boss fights less fun and more complex at times. Also, in-game PvP is awful. Being able to drop in on other players repeatedly with no warnings other than the first hit killing you is a little more when the controls are lackluster. What was promised was lied about. I wish more streamers were honest about the gameplay. Here are my questions. Did no development team plug a Playstation controller into Steam and test the game? Did any of the testers run a keyboard and think, ""wow, this is somehow slower and worse?"" Did they see the aiming ability for the magic characters and think, ""we nailed it?"" All of which is one of the very many reasons I have already requested my refund. Lastly, shame on the development team for turning out this product, and GREAT job to the marketing team for fooling die-hard gamers into parting with their cash on this title.",0
Negative,"Post SotE edit: There's some kind of fundamental design disconnect between how the player is able to interact with the game (primarily with late-game bosses) and how bosses are designed to ""interact"" with the player. For the majority of Elden Ring there's no real issue, there's a decent Dark Souls style back-and-forth just with some mixups but around 70% of the way through the game there's a sudden shift where it feels like I'm trying to play Bloodborne with a Dark Souls moveset, or worse yet in some cases, Sekiro with a Dark Souls moveset. Its a feeling I got often when playing Armored Core 6 as well where it felt like I was SUPPOSED to have iframes but of course those don't exist in that game. There's just a whole lot of really confused crossed wires where they're designing encounters like they're for different games and it stops being fun just because it feels like I'm missing integral game mechanics and having to jury rig a solution with limited options. Unless there's a marked change in how Fromsoft approaches their arpg game design this is going to be the last time I dip into any of their games and I hate to see it. The dark souls series and bloodborne will continue to be some of my favorites of all time and while I loved a lot of Elden Ring there's a fundamental flaw in the development team of From that means they're just not going to be making fun games any more, just ""hard"" games.Finished the game, all I can say is take as much time as you can with it, burnout is real, especially when you're doing bosses almost back-to-back in the lategame, there's also a massive difficulty spike in the last quarter of the game which sucks a lot of fun out of it.The exploration and open world was amazing still but moreso in the first half than the second half.",0
Negative,"Time to revise my review (again)This is probably one of my favorite entries in the souls series, but I have very mixed feelings about saying that. It's a great game, but definitely not a masterpiece by any stretch of the imagination, and it's certainly hard to recommend without several asterisks in its current state, especially on PC.Pros:-Beautiful graphics-More content than any of the previous souls games combined(not considering reused assets)-Pretty refined gameplay-Lots of seriously cool bosses, the final boss is IMO the best enemy in the entire series-A ton of secret areas/other content that you have to go out of your way to find that absolutely stuns you when you find it-Difficult, but the fact that it's open world allows you to come back for challenges at your own pace (if you aren't stubborn like me and die 80 times to the tree guardian because you insisted on fighting him before getting your horse)Cons:-Terrible PC port-Progression can feel shitty, for example you'll oftentimes find yourself out of lower level smithing stones needed to level weapons so you have to go on a duck hunt to find them, not to mention that unique weapons are FAR easier to level than normal ones-Bosses/enemies often feel like stat checks as a result of the very high amount of scaling in the game-Netplay is somehow worse than the last 3 games combined, seriously, don't bother-Reused assets from DS3, including weapon movesets which are honestly very homogenous and lacking-Lots of copy/pasted structures/enemies/bosses-Poor balancing, some weapons suck and some are insane, same with magic. Also, as in other souls games, certain attacks end up being totally useless(most weapon arts) whereas some end up being spammed for 90% of your inputs(the jumping attack)-A good amount of questionably fun bosses and other design decisions (damage sponge bosses come to mind)-Horse gameplay and especially horse combat feels janky and unsatisfying-Fall damage is impossible to judge and feels inconsistent and buggy-Parry windows are very unintuitive and don't sync well with the animation at all-A few bugs and bits of jank that I'm amazed weren't patched out via playtestingAll in all, it's probably about what I was expecting it to be in terms of how good it is. There are some frankly unbelievable oversights and flaws, but this game is at the very least refreshing in a landscape that's populated with games I find unengaging and soulless.",0
Negative,Awful PC port with horrible stutters no matter the specs.Literally a Dark Souls re-skin.,0
Negative,PC controls for this game are absolutely atrocious. The developer should be ashamed of themselves. If I wanted to use a controller I would have bought this for console.,0
Negative,"It does not have an Arabic language, and I cannot play with my friends on the PlayStation platform",0

Negative,this game is way 2 long do something else dont get this game,0
Negative,"From the two hours I played before issuing the refund request, the game is quite simply amazing. This seems like a game I can easily spend hours upon hours in. The combat feels fun even though it can be brutally hard at times. The sense of exploration and freedom this gave me is unmatched. It's very sad that the optimization is absolute garbage. The game doesn't bottleneck either CPU or GPU. Both CPU and GPU settle around 30-50% and even then it just barely reaches 40 fps and even then constantly dips to as low as 20 fps with freezes for up to 3-5 seconds and constant frame drops and stuttering. In a souls-like this is just not acceptable.I've tried fixes mentioned on reddit, nothing worked for me at least.Would definitely want to re-purchase once From Software optimizes the PC port. Such a shame, Yet another poorly optimized AAA title. I'd say wait for a couple of patches till it's optimized.",0
Negative,"It is days like this where I truly wished there was a ""neutral"" option for these reviews, because as a game Elden Ring is fantastic. It is sprawling, beautiful and enthralls me like no other game has in a long time.However, it is simply irresponsible to discard just how bad the technical state of this game is at this moment. Stuttering, framedrops, performance problems no matter the graphical settings, crashes, HDR problems, the list goes on. Not since the original Prepare to die Edition has From delivered a port this messy. If you wanna know if Elden Ring is worth playing the answer is unquestionably yes. Is it worth playing right now on PC? Only if you can tolerate a long long list of issues that need to be fixed.Edit: as of patch 1.02.1, in addition to lackluster performance there are now also a bunch of reoccurring crashes in certain areas, some of them required for the main path, making the game barely playable in certain stretches.",0
Negative,"A genuinely amazing game. The absolute culmination of everything FromSoftware has been working on for over a decade.Unfortunately Elden Ring is also held back by the fact it's been developed by FromSoftware. A company known for their overall technical incompetence.All of the issues you've been reading about in other reviews are true. Some of the suggested fixes help a little bit, but they're not the magic bullets that they're purported to be.Ultrawide support does, technically, exist in the game. Some people have started the game to have their full display utilised. However this is ruined a few seconds later when the space is covered by black bars. FromSoftware seemingly went out of their way to make the PC experience worse. Why? For what purpose? For all it's problems, Dark Souls Remastered had pretty damn great ultrawide support. Why take this step backwards?The worst part of it all? We can't use mods to fix this nonsense without risking a ban from the online component of the game.Well done FromSoftware. You have tarnished the best work you've ever done with your own incompetence.",0
Negative,"Elden Ring and its DLC are amazing, this is known - but the latest patch has introduced some performance issues and bugs.FYI if you get the false positive message ""Inappropriate activity detected"" preventing you from going online, restarting your PC should fix it.Changing my review to negative temporarily to get the issues the attention they need.",0
Negative,"its so bad that I requested a refund, and I've never done that before. Like others have said, it stutters pretty bad (like Joe Biden bad) in open areas and crashes randomly. 6 times in 3 hours for me. My specs are 3070, 10850k, 32gb 7000mhz ram, running on a 2tb SSD.

Negative,"Rated my review down until FROM sort FPS lock and UW/SUW support, and crashes, and flaky network code. This just can't be a positive review until then.So, it's a bit of a joke that, a tool I use called Flawless Widescreen, now has a plugin which can in memory, DLL inject support for SUW and >60fps, after the fact on top of an existing compiled application, but the devs can't manage it. That to me is a phenomenal state of affairs for a dev team. But we can't use that, because of EAC. So. Please FROM, you're an amazing studio, sort out your archaic PC support.Original review:Recommended. But very disappointed in the lack of utrawide and super-ultrawide support. There's just no excuse. None at all. If the modders can do it to other soulsbourne games, the developers can too. And no ""that gives some people an advantage over others"" is not a valid excuse. A better graphics card gives people an advantage too, we don't force everyone to play at lowest detail to put everyone on the same playing field. It's just lazy PC development.The game seems great so far. Such a shame about the launch issues.",0

Negative,"It's Dark Souls but with all the sin of an open world game and a jump button. While the ""legacy"" areas are generally remarkable, the ""side"" content is extraordinarily redundant and the open world is entirely forgettable. There's a disappointing degree of recycling.

Negative,"All right guys this will be a guide for help rather than a review:Common errors: frame rate unsuitable for online play If you face this error you may consider cut off your internet connection, then start the game, and you may reconnect to the internet again. The graphical errors/problems that I have faced so far:Huge FPS drops and black squares appearing in the screen-> In Windows OS, go graphic settings browse elden ring(file path can be found in steam libray properties), then choose optimal perfomance, also in game you should decrease resolution and graphical quality in order to get rid of FPS problems as much as possible.",0
Negative,"Like many people I'm having severe frame rate drops on the PC - putting side that I have a well-specc'd gaming PC and the game is installed to an SSD, even dropping everything to ""low"" settings has no impact at-all on the stuttering. This means that the stuttering is due to inherent flaws in the PC build, rather than being some necessary side-effect of the game needing to process a lot of data.This renders the game unplayable in many parts, as the responsivity of your controls is completely linked to the game's framerate - during a ""stutter"" all you can do is stand immobile whilst enemies wail on you, as the game can't process your input but you can still take damage.",0
Negative,"Frame drops with a 12700k/3080ti, latest nvidia drivers, tried every ""fix"" and even tried low quality graphics settings. Looks like the game release delay couldn't fix these issues :)EDIT: After about 10 hours of gameplay the stutters and frame drops stopped. Maybe only had another stutter about 1% of the time until the end of the game.",0
Negative,"Unplayable. Horrible, constant stutters, drops to 1fps (yes, one), still cannot handle multiple controllers (same problem as in the original Dark Souls!) or high framerates.I'm sorry, but even if the game is good there's no excuse for these things.",0
Negative,"On performance, the game does not run well at all, and controls can be very clunky for PC.Elden Ring is very similar to Dark Souls. You slowly and tensely take down single enemy after single enemy until you reach a boss and die to them over and over again, slowly learning their moveset in the process. Is this process enjoyable? Not to me. The feeling from triumphing against that one enemy after dying fifty times in a row is less euphoria and more catharsis. The bad kind of catharsis, the one that tells you the suffering is finally over. I don't want to suffer in a videogame, I'm not a masochist. The game is extremely punishing and exacting, and I am not perfect nor will I ever be.It's not an enjoyable experience if you don't like hitting your head against a brick wall until something cracks.",0
Negative,"I really wanted to like this game after all the souls games, but I can't. Besides the stuttering and fps drops even in my high end machine, the game itself has issues. It's like the design ideas of this game are focused on all the worst aspects of souls series. There are plenty of large bosses, enemies, and minibosses, and the camera is somehow worse than ds games. To top it off, some of the bosses are near impossible without grinding for stats or using the coop features. Horseback movement is really wonky when locked on, its not fun at all, and the game would have been better off without it imo. It's a shame but it kinda feels like one of those souls-like knockoffs, the art direction is nice though.",0
Negative,"The sudden slowdown in this version renders this PC port of an amazing game nearly unplayable. It seems every 5 - 10 minutes, my game briefly goes from 60fps to 2 - 3 fps. Enemies which were out of range are suddenly right on me and ready to kill me. When it happens, I just have to hold back on my controller for several seconds until it stops because otherwise I'll be killed (and I have been several times). My system is far more powerful than the recommended requirements so there's simply no excuse for this. I'm guessing the issue is somehow caused by their DRM/anti-cheat software. It is completely unacceptable for anyone who paid for this game.",0

Negative,"horrible performance issues, tried every solution found online, to no avail. Wait for a patch before you buy.edit 27/08/22:after a few updates performance got way better, to almost constant 60 FPS on Max settings now (RTX 2060, Ryzen 5 3600, 16 GB DDR4-3200) so thats a plus - but it took them quite a while to get there.I would like a MEH or SIDEWAY THUMBS option for reviews though. because I stil l can't fully recommend the game due to the still existing 2 minute DC on PC and other quirks (mostly gameplay and balancing, general pacing of the game and pvp mechanics)",0
Negative,"I don't do reviews usually . I thought after seeing so damn many reviews with 10, i was thinking: how bad can it be ? i mean, they already did other great games etc.Well, to have a good and fun game you also need to work on technical parts. It's useless if :- the controls are shit- you have to fiddle half an hour in settings to change the fu_c*ing gamepad in a PC game ? who the f. puts as default a gamepad on a PC game ? Lazy bastards .- no v-sync in game. my eyes were bleeding after half an hour on a big screen. I managed to force it from nvidia, because you have no f ing setting for it- no ultrawide . in 2022, in a 3D game, where you don't have to do special things to just change the damn resolution to cover the whole screen.- only 60 fps ?. and this is not all, it will drop to 30, on a ryzen 5900x with 3080 and not even max settings. (motion blur off, depth of field off, antialising off etc )The bottom line is, after 1 hour, my eyes were hurting so i stopped, i'm going back to God of war ( a proper game port )What a joke of a port . i hate all youtube reviewers . what a bunch of sleazy bastards.

Negative,"Lagging badly when some bosses attack, FPS is not stable on HIGH graphics settings with RTX 3080ti + i7-11700k + 32G RAM. Nothing other than these but if you don't want this game shit like cyberpunk2077, Just do better in future. Also, FU for not adding PS controller key display",0
Negative,"As someone with a visual impairment, this game is not accessible. No options for changing the HUD scale or font sizes, all the colours blend together too.Previous Souls games were by no means perfect and have never had HUD scaling, but at least they weren't so painfully unreadable in the first place.big sad.",0
Negative,"If Elden Ring wasn't a souls game, i would consider giving it a positive review. But as part of the series, it drops the ball in bizarre fashion. First, i'll state that the open world is a nice addition. It's beautiful, enjoyable to traverse, and is convincingly alive. I personally find it less compelling than the interconnected world of Dark Souls or even the level structure of Demon Souls; but it's not too far behind in my mind. Now onto more critical aspects. I'll separate them into categories for clarity. Problems with the open world: The early game has a lot to explore, but not much in the way of rewards. I spent my first 20 hours looking for a weapon that appealed to me and fit my build; it literally never happened and i restarted the game with a different build so i could enjoy the game. This dichotomy inverts upon reaching the late-game, now you're showered with equipment, but the world is stale. Second, there's only one good way to acquire each tier of crafting materials: the mine of each corresponding tier. Meaning if you want to upgrade equipment, you will almost always go to the same locations; upon replaying, the game began to feel like a checklist.This checklist feel extends to the legacy dungeons, which all turn out to be fairly linear. While they're still a high point in the game, it would be nice if there were many ways to enter and traverse them. (Though stormveil is an exception for linear traversal) Lore: This is the first Souls game where i was totally apathetic to the lore. Perhaps it's in how it's set up: In Demon Souls you were bound to the nexus and tasked to lul the old one back to it's slumber, In Dark Souls Oscar asks you to ring the bell of awakening with his dying breath, in Bloodborne you're tossed into the turmoil of night of the hunt, in Sekiro you're scarred by dragon rot and are compelled by Kuro to help end it and in dark souls 2 some hags verbally assault you which compels you to link the flame. k, maybe the souls series has dropped the ball before. Still i feel Elden Ring lacks a narrative thrust. For me, it was at the 30 hour mark where i finally became invested in the world.( I started Ranni's questline) Re-use: This game re-uses a LOT of assets. It's noticeable immediately, and you'll probably think: ""It's a lot of work to make an open world game, i underst-"", and before you've finished your thought, you're playing Dark Souls 2 Definitive Edition. Seriously, it's bad. Half the bosses you'll see will be reused at least once, the lesser dungeons are virtually identical, you will see the same castle walls in 400 different places, and a handful of AI are from Dark Souls 3. At a certain point, just cut the content. There is so much re-use in this game and it actively harms the game. I can't express my level of disappointment when, after hours delving underground, i reached the depths of the Erdtree's roots. Exiting the cutscene, I was amazed. Seeing that the erdtree, a primordial entity, had it's own ecosystem; and for a moment saw it, not as a towering godlike symbol, but as a part of life itself. I then looked to my right and saw the same castle i'd seen 40 thousand times and realized i was playing elden ring. Bosses: This is the most egregious aspect of Elden Ring. On it's own, Elden Ring's bosses are cosmically bad; but with an incredible legacy of amazing bosses spanning the Souls series, the way Elden Ring's bosses turned out is almost incomprehensible. The Souls series discovered in their first outing, Demon Souls, that bosses, above all, had to be interesting. As the series went on the games leant more into the direction of pushing combat mechanics to their limit. Amazing bosses were produced in so doing, but something was lost in the process. You would assume i'm giving this context to explain where Elden Ring's bosses went as a consequence of this. I'm not. Elden Ring's bosses are devoid of all logic and reason, as though they were developed for a different game or none of the bosses were ever play tested. Leave aside the ridiculous boss re-use. Almost all main bosses are loaded with outlandish combos, tiny recovery windows, dodges and mobility, single-frame swings after ridiculous anticipatory windups and AOE and lingering hitboxes. But most damningly, almost all of the bosses in the game do FAR too much damage, no matter how good you're doing, you're always at risk of being stunlocked to death or one-shotted. Even when the game finally had an experiential boss, God-Devouring Serpent/Rykard, which in my mind set a new standard the David & goliath style bossfight, it was marred by one-shots (and rng one-shots at that).I don't have anything to close this. bonersEdit: The game actually only features 8 bosses that are not re-used. This is from a pool of around 120 bosses.",0
Negative,"Tried to enjoy for 12+ hours. Gave up because it just makes me want to play other games with faster combat. Grew to hate it a bit due to all the pretentious hype. If you already know that you enjoy From's combat in Souls titles, don't listen to me, this might be your favorite game ever. But if you're on the fence, or if you typically prefer fast and smooth combat, you might agree that this really is not the ultimate open-world fantasy combat game that it's made out to be.- Slow and sluggish combat with too few options available to you at a given time. This is my biggest problem with the game and the biggest reason why I've given up on enjoying it. Obviously this game is difficult, this has nothing to do with that. Playing Elden Ring just makes me want to alt F4 and go play a Team Ninja or PlatinumGames game with the fast, smooth, mobile, combo-oriented combat I crave.- Blatantly, enormously flawed multiplayer with the most pretentious reasoning I've ever heard for a game design decision. I really do not care about how Miyazaki had help pushing his car over a snowy hill or whatever. Games like this are best to be played through, uninterrupted, with friends imo. This is simply not doable in Elden Ring without frequent interruptions, frequent tech issues, and forced cheesy PvP, unless you install mods that are not guaranteed to work either.- One of the most dead-feeling open worlds I've ever seen, with a pretentious and simply ineffective minimalist approach to ""storytelling.""+ World is visually pretty+ Cool dark fantasy aesthetic+ Great sound design makes certain attacks feel brutal+ Some cool weapons I would like to see other devs take notes on+ Some really cool spells+ Great character customization, with a cool ""similar faces"" feature that pretty much goes ""this might be more like what you were going for.""Again, if you are already a fan of Dark Souls games (I mean Dark Souls, not souls-likes in general) please don't listen to me, you will likely enjoy this. For me, Dark Souls was a big miss, and my time trying Elden Ring did nothing to convince me to give From souls games another chance going forward.",0

Negative,"This game is a sad state of affairs.Every time I come back to this game, I am filled with disappointment of what could have been. I really dislike this game. But like a drug addict, or a lover in an abusive relationship, I keep coming back. 'I can fix her' and so forth. No, you can't. Its really saddening to see this as well, as a fan of the soulsborne games with multiple hundred hours in various games.Alright, so what is the problem of this game? Well, there are many and I'm bound to miss quite a few, so I'll begin with the ones that hurt me personally the most.1.) Vigor is the new adaptability. You ever played dark souls 2. Then you will know that the majority of people who refuse to play that game is due to this stat. However, at least in dark souls 2, levelling vigor actually made an impact in combat. And that there is a strategy between being a glass cannon or being a beefy boi. In elden ring, there is no strategy or unique builds. If you want to reliably clear the game, you will eventually be funnelled into using the same uninventive builds as everyone else. Why is this? Because vigor makes zero imapact to gameplay. You have 60 vigor? Congrats you still die in one combo like someone with 20 vigor. As combos in this game are undodgable once you get hit once, meaning that as long as the enemy touches you. You are pretty much dead. However at the very least, dark souls 2 made a countermeasure to adaptability being a stat. In dark souls 2, you gained ALOT more souls from enemies and the environment - and levelling didn't inflate so much. In elden ring however, you gain very little 'runes' and levelling inflation is similar to dark souls 3. Which again, was a pain, but wasn't an issue in that game due to weapons having very low stat requirements in that game. In this game, Miyazaki looked at himself in the mirror and went ""Bigger number, better game."" Not to mention that every stat increased health in dark souls 2, and attunement increased adaptability too.2.) Mobility and movesets. If you've played elden ring you know exactly what I am talking about. The player character has dark souls 1 mobility whilst the enemies have bloodborne mobility. If you are new to the soulsborne genre, let me explain it to you. You the player, roll slowly, recover from stagger slowly, run slowly, attack slowly whilst the enemy is able to do backflips, teleport behind you, do 120 hit combos like it is a hack and slash game and literally do half your health by brushing your shoulder. Not to mention some of the bullshit mechanics that carried over from dark souls to elden ring, such as enemies hitting you from the other side of the wall. You would think they would fix some 'bullshit' parts of their game by now. The game is no longer a contest on 'skill' as it is a contest of patience. Learning movesets for the sake of learning movesets. Enemies with unrealistic attack delays, which are generally unfun. Not once did I feel thrill from avoiding an attack with a delay, as I literally had to wait 10 seconds for this fat fuck to drop his weapon down which for some reason is an aoe which is also delayed so you have to dodge after the weapon hits the floor, rather than when the weapon hits the floor. It is a game design that punishes logic and reaction time, whilst rewarding patience. Which is a problem when the entire game is fast paced apart from the player character.3.) Severely unbalanced. Linking back to point 1, where I mentioned that vigor doesn't matter. All enemies have a potential to instant kill you. It might not exactly be one hit, but may be a combo - linking back to point 2, where the player mobility is so bad that the moment you are hit once, you stagger for a second. Bear in mind that an enemy can hit you 3 times in that second and 'instant' kill you. This is a problem. Enemy health and damage are not balanced in the slightest. You the player, the runner up to be the next elden lord, are so pathetically weak in comparison to the enemies. In an mmorpg, when you level up, you feel like the big dog in town, never is the area you are in harder in the area you were in previously as your character scales with the levelling process. In this game, regardless of whether you are in a mid game area or a late game area, you will still die in one hit. Scaling is terrible, especially considering the scarcity of upgrade materials, the game often forcing you into a specific weapon for the whole game with obvious demerits for changing weapon. The only time you can really start experimenting with new weapons without losing out on damage due to an upgraded weapon is right at the end of the game. The reward system is also shit. This game rewards you for rushing ahead, stay behind and clear the whole area for what? You aren't going to level due to the level inflation. You can spend an hour in an area to 100% it, whilst the runes you gain from that equal spending 5 minutes in the next area. The game advocates rushing through it as soon as possible. Not to mention that once you get passed the beginning areas, limgrave, weeping peninsula and caelid. There is only one way to go, creating a linear forced gameplay, which was one of the things I disliked about dark souls 3. It is unbelievable to me that radahn drops less runes than a repeat boss of a tree in the same area. It makes no sense.4.) Unfinished game. The game balancing is unfinished. The enemy variation and bosses are also unfinished. Or at least resemble a laziness and lack of inspiration. There shouldn't be the exact same catacombs with mobs as the bosses. There shouldn't be bosses that are repeated so much they seem like normal mobs when you encounter them. The areas feel desolate and sparse, as if they are there to pad out the game time. If the game was linear, I doubt that it would affect the overall gameplay much. Torrent as a horse is poorly designed lacking much needed mobility such as a dodge, especially when it takes 2 seconds to get hit 15 times and fall off your horse, which takes an additional 10 seconds to recover (enough time to kill you 30 times over). The jump doesn't work half the time causing you to die from a 10 metre gap, yet survive a 20 metre fall on foot. The game really does feel like the developers ran out of inspiration half way through development. Especially the intro scene when you first made your character. I remember playing the game for the first time and wondering if I bought the correct game or not. As a person who had received animated intros to dark souls 1/2/3/bloodborne. I WAS NOT EXPECTING A FUCKING SLIDESHOW. I genuinely felt scammed. The whole setting seems. just bad. I can't really describe it. Perhaps it was the boss fights. Unlike in dark souls 3 where the bosses feel significant and mean something. Everything in elden ring feels valueless. Like cardboard cut outs. Think about it, what if in the intro, you had an animated segment about Godrick kicking ass, or Margit doing some cool shit. It would add significance to the battles you face. But instead we get a still image of a poo man getting hanged. And the fight you get with said poo man is another npc invasion - that is completely missable - rather than a cool ass boss. All the bosses are forgettable and meaningless.The development team has taken many steps back, and in my opinion have forgotten what made the soulsborne series so good. Instead believing that artificial difficulty fixes everything. This sort of laziness, and in a sense apathy to the consumer is worrying. I fear the next release from from soft. But I suppose like the symbolism of dark souls 3. It is time to let go of the flame, and let the era of darkness ensue. Perhaps sparks will ignite again making a new masterpiece, but as elden ring is as of now. I have no hope that the next game will out perform their older games. The team has shown a decline with the idea of 'open world' as open world is notorious for a dying franchise. A last resort if you will.",0

I got lucky one time and found someone to play with and they are forced to leave the moment you kill a boss. Garbage ass idea. Why even have a multiplayer function?

Negative,"Refund this mess.This game is an utter mess. Looks like it would be great fun, if it was properly coded and vetted before release. which it clearly wasn't. It actually runs worse indoors in the first area of the game than when you go outside. There's unexplainable slowdowns near the exit of the graveyard cave you start in. With only 2 hours to decide to refund or not and being at 1.7h, I have no choice but to refund this. In it's current state it belongs in a trash can. I can't sit around and wait for them to fix it, or hope it's 'only in the beginning', as I wouldn't be able to refund (and if the very first areas of the game are problematic. the FIRST impression of the game, you know they didn't optimize anything after either).The anticheat they are using is also likely causing issues.I dont really care about the 60 fps cap, people who whine about that make me laugh. The problem is it's not steady FPS, even with great hardware. I have a 2080 super, should have 0 problems. already experiencing tons of problems. Folks with 3080's are also posting the same stuff.These high end cards should be breezing through this game, but the company was too concerned with hype and taking your money than putting out a quality product.Remember: Never pre-order, just buy it on release so you are within the return window when it comes out - then, if a company proves once again that they don't give a damn about their customers, you can refund via steam no questions asked - just make sure you do it before you play for 2+ hours.",0

Negative,"Elden Ring is a decent game with too many issues.The Good:-The open world aspect of the game is cool; Running around on foot or on your horse and exploring new areas is exciting and a lot of fun (to a point).-This game has a good amount of variety in what you can use to fight and what is actually viable. For example, magic is busted, melee combat is solid, and shields are actually useful. -Elden Ring looks very cool.The Not So Good:-Even for a dark souls game, this game is fucking brutal. It's not deliberately brutal either; it's just unbalanced and wonky. Also, some of the enemies (and almost all of the bosses) you'll fight are just broken. Boss battles in this game are usually really hard since they attack relentlessly, have 7000 different moves ready and never give you a chance to attack or even heal. If you aren't used to the difficulty of the souls series, I wouldn't start here, since this game isn't just Souls difficult, but artificially difficult in itself.-pretty awful launch and is still a bit unbalanced performance-wise to this day. some areas are very laggy regardless of graphics settings while others run smoothly.-a lot of recycled game content from the souls games, like animations, mechanics and so on. That's not terribly bad, but at the same time, this was supposed to be something new, not dark souls 4. To be fair, I think Sekiro did the same thing, which might just say something about Fromsoft and not really this game in particular.-the content within the game is also recycled often. Bosses/minibosses and even regular enemies are often just reskinned and used again across multiple areas, meaning that mostly you'll be fighting the same dumbass bosses over and over again over the course of the whole game.-typical nonsensical lore but this time, they've just recycled dark souls plot devices and changed the names. Did GRR Martin actually do anything? I feel like Fromsoft included his name for publicity and not much else.-at first, i thought elden ring addressed DS3's problem of having a few obvious metas but it has metas of its own instead. oh well.-the open world seems really big until it doesn't. most of the world is lacking in content despite its size. the dark souls games felt a bit more balanced in this regard because they werent massive open world games, but with elden ring, you have this really big world with very little substance. the most exciting thing in the open world is a miniboss in a cave somewhere that gives you 1 useless spell or weapon that is already outclassed by the time you get it (or is just useless to begin with). and thats assuming you even get a spell/weapon! most of the time, you'll be running around looking for items and you'll get crafting items you don't care about/won't use or one smithing stone from a specific level (usually something awkward like level 4).a gigantic open world game like this one only works if it's balanced and actually fun. having a massive world for the sake of it is never a good idea. I appreciate what fromsoft was doing and i think this game could have been incredible, but it has too many annoying things about it that drag it down.",0

Forget about hitboxes, it's unplayable.I should have known better than to pre order a game again, it seems that you get burned anytime you do this. It's not even about the money I spent, it's the fact that I've financially supported a company that apparently harbors a seething, irrational, unrelenting, bitter HATRED for it's customers.

Negative,Game won't even open. Immediate white screen then crash without the option of a crash report.,0
Negative,Poor optimization. Definitely not worth buying at this time,0
Negative,What a crap optimization. Graphics settings do not affect anything. I luled.,0
Negative,My keyboard doesn't have arrow keys. guess i can't mount since you can't change that keybind for some strange reason. How about have the tutorial keybind hints match the input device being used by the player in a full price video game. Nice regurgitated bland attempts at snarky humor littering the entirety of the open world map in the form of glowing white messages making an otherwise beautiful world completely unimmersive.,0
Negative,"Terrible PC port, every menu in the game has controller inputs shown even tho no controller is connected. No ultra wide support. ""press Y"" even tho it is defaulted as E. just lazy. I really want to love this but it the real challenge is just trying to play it.",0
