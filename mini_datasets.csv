0,"I heavily enjoy this game and do recommend it to people who read this, but I am going to review a negative review as a major exploit that lets hackers flat out reset your save file with a possibility of crashing your PC if they want is currently going around and causing lots of damage, and as such this thumbs down review will be a semi-silent protest to Fromsoft and Bandai to notice the sudden drop in positive reviews and see that this massive explot is the reason and fix it.Here's a link to where you can learn more about this exploit:https://www.reddit.com/r/darksouls3/comments/n1235k/potential_pc_security_exploit_spreading/Good luck to all, and hopefully your jolly co-operation stays jolly."
0,"Update 07.08.2022 - they finally have warnings up to let potential buyers know that the games don't currently have multiplayer. Now we wait. 6 months and counting for a AAA studio to fix an issue that modders fixed on custom servers way back in January.Because I don't see many reviews talking about it, I'll do so. The entire Dark Souls series on PC has been offline since 23.01.2022 due to an exploit. Bandai Namco promised a fix ""soon"", but as of 04.04.2022, we still haven't heard anything back. On the store pages for Dark Souls 1 Remastered and Dark Souls 2, multiplayer is still one of the advertised features in the descriptions. Bandai Namco is selling these games without telling people that the multiplayer is no longer available and there is no definite date for a fix."
0,"Love the Dark Souls series. Love this game. Lots of great challenges, loads of good lore, lots of good times on multiplayer. Why am I leaving a negative review? Hackers have ruined the online experience. And for me, online play is a huge appeal in these games. But after years of playing and over 100 hours logged, a single hacker throwing hacked items into my inventory has banned me from online play. Nevermind the fact that I hit alt-f4 immediately after I saw this happening. Nevermind the fact that I loaded a backup save from before I even encountered the hacker. No. Bandai doesn't give a shit. A hacked item touched my account for 1 second. Now I'm deemed a turbo-hacker in Bandai's eyes and I can't play with my friends, which is why I came back to this game in the first place.I will change my review if and when Bandai decides to not punish players who make active strides to circumvent the efforts of hackers and want to play the game legitimately."
0,"You know the drill. Dark Souls 3 single-player is great and worth price of admission alone. Contrary to the memes, the game is not that difficult. It’s true!Then why the negative review, you ask? Because Dark Soul 3’s thoroughly lacking net code for online play is extremely dangerous. At the time of writing, at least two different unpatched Remote Code Execution (RCE) exploits in Dark Souls 3[duckduckgo.com] have been found. RCE exploits allow bad actors to execute arbitrary code on a player’s PC remotely. RCE exploits are the Dark Souls of cyber security. I cannot understate the severity of this. And Dark Souls 3, when connected to online multiplayer, leaves your system wide open.The first RCE exploit, found and detailed in April 2021, has persisted for almost a year without any reaction from Bandai Namco & FromSoftware. It fell on the community to provide unofficial anti-cheat software (entitled “Blue Sentinels”)[www.nexusmods.com] to protect Dark Souls 3 players from malicious actors online.The second RCE exploit was made public in January 2022 by members of the Dark Souls community. (The exploit had already been previously reported to Bandai Namco & FromSoftware in December 2021[www.fanbyte.com].)  As of today (2022-02-09) online play in FromSoftware’s Souls games (DS, DS2, DS3) has been disabled for more than two weeks[www.theverge.com] following a public demonstration of this second RCE exploit on twitch[clips.twitch.tv], ostensibly to mitigate risk and give FromSoftware time to fix the issue before the launch of ELDEN RING (2022), which is assumed to share a considerable part of its net code with the older games. The fact that the revelation of the first RCE exploit last year did not warrant an immediate and coordinated response from Bandai Namco & FromSoftware is frankly unacceptable. Adding insult to injury, it took a second RCE exploit and the resulting financial risk of it torpedoing the launch of their highly anticipated next title to actually spur Bandai Namco & FromSoftware into action. Needless to say, this is extremely irresponsible behaviour by a software firm selling its product to millions of customers. The only silver lining is that the temporary take-down of online functionality at least mitigates the present security risks. A much belated software patch to fix the exploits might be incoming.Buyers beware."

0,"This game is amazing, but I'm setting a negative score until NAMCO decides to set an acceptable price tag on this game. This is a 2016 game where they're charging full price. Here in Brazil, this game is actually more expensive than Elden Ring (and there wasn't a single instance where they put this game on sale during the entirety of 2022, check SteamDB),. A complete joke by NAMCO. If you want this game, try to find another store to buy the key, I'm pretty sure they're way cheaper than through Steam.EDIT (July 30th 2023): They lowered the price a little bit, now it's costing the same as Elden Ring. It's still super expensive for a 7 year-old game nonetheless."
0,"Honestly an amazing game. But this game was released in 2016 and still costs like the price of a 2023 brand new game (60 bucks), and is even worse in South America, where money inflation is a hell. This game offers nothing new appart of the classic 2 DLCs and basic mantainment. So you CAN'T be serious with the price."
0,Love this game but right now on PC it needs to be patched there is too much hacking going on. just lost my progress due to hackers
0,couldn't focus Andre is too hot and distracting
0,"Hackers can force shit into your inventory, break your save and permanently ban you from online servers.What a fucking embarrassment."
0,Fun game but Bandai-Namco doesn't understand what a PC is.
0,"Honestly an amazing game. But fuck me, this was released 7 years ago and still costs 101$ for me with both DLC's?? You can't be serious. For PS4 it's less than a 1/3rd of that. And for that, you greedy bastards, you get a big fat 0 from me."
0,"One of the greatest games ever made, following the footsteps of the first dark souls with improved animations, netcoding and general mechanics. This game feels very smooth and fights are absolutely amazing. Dark souls 3 adds more challenge to the game by making the mobs more aggressive, a lot like in BloodBorn. I absolutely want to recommend this game as a big fan of dark souls series and for the gameplay quality but due to it's state I can not do so, I feel like I have the responsibility to inform you about the situation that's going on in the game. Cheaters have taken over the game in large numbers, Dark souls has it's own brutal anti-cheat system but it is very ineffective when cheaters can create alt steam accounts to bypass bans and strike again. The cheating scene has been going on for years and years now but it has evolved to the point where cheaters can actually cause permanent damage to your PC or even pish information you'd not want to share online. These cheats are evolving constantly due to the big playerbase and lack of action from Bandai Namco. So who knows maybe in future Dark souls 3 on steam could work as a backdoor access to your PC in a way. Very high security risk here. I talked to Bandai Namco's support about the issue and they are aware of what is going on and I was told that they are working on the issue, but in truth nothing has been done in 3 years or so when all this started to boom.If you play this game in OFFLINE mode you will not have any problems, also there are mods such as Blue-Sentinel which is telling you when you are being invaded by a cheater and it tries to block you connecting to them in future, use of this mod is bannable reason but Bandai Namco's anti-cheat can't track it as the mod does not affect the game itself that much. I recommend using this mod if you plan to play the game."
0,"UPDATE FROM MY OLD REVIEW FROM THE RELEASEa Remote Code Execution (also known as RCE) exploit has emerged for Dark Souls III on PC. This means that potentially malicious players connected to your game may be able to execute code by sending information to your game that directly affects aspects of your operating system. This can lead to sensitive information leaks, including but not limited to: installation of malicious programs such as keyloggers or viruses, theft of account information or login tokens, and access to other sensitive information such as banking info or other things that may be stored on your computer.DO NOT PLAY THE GAME ONLINE, blue-sentinel is working on a fix, but a complete newbie who buys this game on sale will be exposed to this regardless, please be careful guys.I love dark souls 3... BUT! [CAUTION] INVALID GAME DATA HAS BEEN DETECTED! This Anti-Cheat programm causing legit players to get banned!Cheaters are currently able to get innocent players permanently banned, as well as modifying stats.. As a result, the online is unplayable for anyone who doesn't want to risk having their save ruined and get permanently banned from the online as a result.Fix this Anti-Cheat programm please!Namco noted that some of the bans may have been by accident. They'll check for false positives, and in the meantime, you should contact customer support. (i will delete this review if namco fixed this anti cheat)"
0,"Great game, as long as you don't play multiplayer.I encountered someone who had glitched the game.  When they hit me with an enchanted dagger, they started changing my soul count to 50,000,000+.   The game then ejected me and banned me due to having 'inconsistent data'.   Due to someone else's hacking, I lost a character I had used 20+ hours of time.   Hackers remain unpunished while legit players become victims.   Unacceptable. Patch notes have absolutely no detail of changes, just some vague statements about things being 'adjusted'.  Also Unacceptable.From Software needs to step up and fix their issues or their amazing game will wind up a disappointment."
0,"How's that possible to a multimillion company with multibillion publisher to have not solved security issue less than a month and stop game servers altogether? You could probably with 5% of any DS sales take security experts and game devs around the world to resolve this in a month, but greedy Fromcuckware with Banzai Scamco thought that resolving this issue is not important and just don't give a single fuck about fanbase and their bestseller games, the games that made this company as big as they could, but yet everything remains still.I'm utterly perplexed why community haven't had a backlash towards those cucks. Fuck this greedy bastards, remove souls games from steam - if you have zero capacity to properly maintain your games."

0,"I'm bad at this game. But instead of taking accountability and improve my skills, I will blame the game instead."
0,"The game is amazing. but i got banned because i picked up something from an invader who turned out to be a hacker, resulting in me not being able to play co-op. Such a let down for such a great game.This game also does not have cloud saves."
0,"I got banned because someone else was hacking and injected items into my inventory, they say if it happens again I'll be perma'd. Yeah thanks, better not get invaded or summoned ever again. Don't make backups either, that's a bannable offense.I'm not trying to pretend there's an easy fix for hacking without a better anticheat, but anyone can tell that a system that allows cheaters to ban innocent players is worse than no system at all.EDIT: LOL there's an RCE exploit"
0,"I'm editing this review later on into a proper one, but I'm leaving a negative review because Bandai is at it again trying to straight up rob people with their prices in south america.There's no excuse for these prices, since they can still load their pockets from people who can actually pay for them in first world countries, so I'm putting negatives on every game that updates prices to unreasonable amounts in a market that actually allows for regionalization.And for all my south american friends out there who can't pay for it: Just play the Jack Sparrow version, don't let them get away with it ;)"

0,stop looking at bad reviews. get the game dumbass. its a good game get it already.
0,Banco has a major issue with banning the innocent and somehow turning a blind eye to the actual cheaters. Seeing how I have been banned from Remastered and 3 I cannot support Banco
0,My wife left me
0,"Absolutly amazing game, worth the money atleast twice over. Beautifully dark and superior visuals. However, there's a chance you'll get banned from online play for no reason because From Software and their buggy servers think you have ""invalid game data"". After they warn you to stop using your save you still get the warning and banned even if you delete your save and start over. A cruel joke.EDIT: To answer your questions, the best cause for the ban I can figure is that I played offline for a bit when steam went down then went back online with a save file that probably didnt match their records."
0,"As much as i want to love this game , there is one thing that really put a bad taste in my mouth.First week i was playing fine , the second week they started their anti-cheat system. (which usually is a good idea).I got a warning that i had invalid data on my pc, and reading after several threads i decided to remove the game, save games and blacklist in rivatuner (so it wouldnt use it).After redownloading the game, starting fresh (with a xbox360 controller) , i had fun for about a week until yesterday.Yesterday i got a message my account has been penalized and i had been banned from the multiplayer part of the game. So i can no longer co-op  or invade.I have no 3rd party software running , no cheats, no mods and no overlay software (only the steam overlay!).I have read on many forums this thing is all happening automaticly , and from software cant do anyting about it.  im pretty gutted since MP was a crucial part of the game and now i cant play it properly anymore.     And to think i even bought the season pass as well. I wanted to buy the PC version since obviously that is supposed to be the best version , well after this drama i cant really recommend it to anyone.  So either get the console version or avoid it at all cost."
0,"This is mostly a baby rage post, but in late january 2022-early february 2022 FSW identified a terrible exploit which allowed people invading you to remotely run most any program they want on your PC. Downloading any username/password/file you have saved to your computer? done with a single command. It is almost 2 months after their announcement of this and it has not been fixed, and on the day of their announcement they shut all Dark Souls servers down until further notice. I had no idea this existed until I looked into why I could not login to the server no matter what, and have been playing the game since like 2018 for 161 hours. It's not terribly much, but this exploit has been present since I started playing, and for the risk posed to me and other people I bought the game for and exposed to this, fuck this game."
0,"Welp 1st negative review I think. Great game. Everything is top tier. Easily the most challenge I've ever experienced in a video game but From, the Devs, are trying to destroy the game.The anti-cheat will ban innocent players because cheaters injected items into your game. Hundreds of hours wasted because From is too lazy. If you intent to play the game normally and use online aspects you are forced to manually save your files, download 3rd party programs that apparently bypass the broken anti-cheat TO PROTECT YOU from wrongfully getting banned and even then you might still get penalized because another player decided to cheat in your game. Unacceptable.They also recently got rid of Family Share which helped players who were wrongfully banned and lost their characters to still play.Avoid this until something serious is done to properly address the issues mentioned."
0,"-Play 120hrs-want to play area so get the season pass-play well enough to get to gold -face hacker that one shots you with invisible soul spear-take screenshot of hacker before game freezes and bugs out-report hacker-start playing game again after 3 months have pasted-wonder why no one is playing area-realize that you were banned-realize there is no way to get unbanned-nothing but regrets.Lesson learned: never play online......Honestly I love Dark Souls, but this kind of stuff is ridiculous."
0,"I was subject to the new hack that reset all my save progress and sent me back to firelink shrine, trapping me there.I had been loving the game and I had just spent the last 37 hours playing.This security issue needs to be addressed before this game can be recommended again, this is a huge issue that could even cause GPU hacks and totally corrupt your PC.VALVE ADDRESS THIS NOW, THIS GAME SHOULD BE PULLED FROM YOUR STORE UNTIL THIS IS ADDRESSED!!!DO NOT BUY THIS GAME RIGHT NOW!"
0,"Edit as of 28-05-2021: Hackers are running rampant in this game. Playing with a friend, and he got put into NG++, then after 30 min he got put into NG+4. Just playing co-op, no invasion or anything. Just a connection error and back to the start of the game it is. Lost all progression multiple times and got put into a more difficult game.A fix is a MOD, not something official by the developer. I would not recommend getting this game until this is fixed. If you already own it, I would strongly recommend you to use the Blue Sentinel mod. Spend more than 100 hours ""getting gud"" only to be one-shot by a naked dude with a massive weapon hidden in his prison pocket. 10/10, would recommend. On a more serious note: Beautiful scenery with a bittersweet ""story"", rewarding combat and adrenaline inducing fights. This game keeps dragging me back in, play through after play through. There is enough content to enjoy yourself and the DLC's are the cherry on top. If you like to challenge yourself and have the temper to not destroy your controller, you should definitely try it out! Stay safe, skeleton!"
0,"This game is great i love it enjoy it alot.but it has the worst automated cheater detection ever.I just got banned for no reason. i died alot but i never hack, never cheat, never use any outside programsLike many other legit players that got ban because of their shtty ban system. and i swear that im not the first and wont be the last.    In most common infamous case. A hacker happen to join into your game. they can do weird stuff like force adding stats, forcing items into your characters and mess up your save files and you'll be ban and burn in hell for it. and there are many hackers out there. game will force you to delete your savefiles.  all those time you invest into leveling will be gone. If you wanna buy this game to experience online PVP coop. you have to accept that you risk lose your characters and all your sht at anytime. all those hours, days, weeks invested, gone.  its really frustrate. its a great game tho if you wanna buy it and dont care much about pvp and just wanna enjoy sp story. but you have been warned."

0,"3-30-22 i'm still unable to access the the online game server, and I suspect they think this issue is resolved, it is not. Do not purchase this game for download until they finally get off their ass and fix it for everyone. In addition, they conveniently leave out the fact that your save files will not go to the cloud, soyou will not find out until after the fact when you have a PC issue that requires reinstalling your operating system like I did, stupid me for not taking an image, but f*ck you for wiping out 464 hour of gameplay."

0,"The point of this review is to point out the flaws and problems with the game. To help people make an informed decision before buying the game. You should always read multiple reviews, not just one. It's with a heavy heart that I write this review. It is of course my personal opinion. As a player with several thousand hours between Demons souls, Dark souls on PS3 and PC, Dark souls 2 on PS3 aswell as on pc, Dark souls 2: SotFS on pc, and Bloodborne on PS4, I feel I am obligated to write this. For the record, this review will change if the current state of the game improves, but as it stands, the game is not worth buying. While yes, it is a souls game, it is in a poor state. I'll first start by saying that I never played the japanese version, even though it released almost 3 weeks early there. That of course would allow for some sense of reassurance that many of the major issues with networking and balancing would be sorted out by the time of full release. Unfortunately, that's not the case. When the game fully released, the first area of the game after getting to the main hub was in essense broken. For whatever reason, the game made it almost impossible for a lot of people to see summon signs of friends while using the password system. The system that is supposed to make sure that those summon signs were the only ones visible to you and your friends. However, without a password, tons of signs were easily visible. Even if they were useless in the sense that 70% of summon attempts would simply fail and say ""unable to summon phantom"". So, 3 weeks early and the networking for the first area doesn't even work properly. Alright, moving on to the next area, summon signs without passwords still refused to work on a regular basis, and STILL DO at the time of my writing this. However, passworded signs would show up. This brings me to the next glaring issue, there are multiple covenants in the game that are dependant on automatically being summoned for an area to defend it or to defend a player who is already invaded. These covenants were next to useless when the game released as they would never send you to defend the area associated with your covenant. Thus making it that much harder to aquire the covenants items required to rank up to aquire certain spells and rings that are necessary for the acheivements. Unless you want to farm trash mobs for an hour+ to get your covenants drops. That's right, FromSoft was kind enough to add a method of grinding for the covenants that negates even needing to use them. Seems to me they knew that their networking was so broken that they made sure to add an offline method of doing covenants. Before anyone says, ""Well they put it there so people can play offline and still do all the covenants and such."" I doubt that someone so concerned with collecting all the items and such would play offline. Another interesting thing, is that the armor stat ""Poise"" (it's in armor pieces stat pages, on the character stat page and there's a ring dedicated to boosting poise) is turned off in the config files for players. However, NPC's still have it. It essentially makes actual defense stats more important than anything. Unless you use certain heavy weapons that have infinite poise while using a light attack. It makes trading with heavy weapons an impossibility if you're playing PvP as hitting them before their attack connects does not stun them and leaves you completely open for a full hit, which WILL stun you and give them a free second hit before you're able to roll away. And again, before anyone says ""git gud"", keep in mind I typically keep my builds lightweight and even use the carthus bloodring to improve my i-frames while dodging. Not being able to interrupt someone simply because their weapon is bigger and happens to give them hyper armor while swinging puts myself at a major disadvantage regardless of any factors. What else... Oh, the mind numbing difficulty of the game... I'm kidding of course. As far as souls games go, Dark souls 3, is objectively the easiest and most forgiving. Not only are most of the larger, tougher enemies either stun lockable with the help of a phantom, but the larger ones can be viceral attacked after connecting a few hits on them, usually killing them. Also, the difference between New Game and NG+ is negligable. I've completely the game 4 times already, both NG and NG+ and have been horribly dissappointed with NG+. The enemies are hardly any tougher, as you're character is already fully geared by the time you get there and just getting more powerful. Not to mention the signature addition of random dark spirit invaders and red phantom versions of normal enemies that would appear in NG+ in previous games, all the way back to Demons Souls. It's not a new concept, and it kept NG+ fresh and exciting. The ONLY thing to look forward to in NG+ over NG in Dark souls 3 is +1 versions of rings. And I've heard that the only thing in NG++ is +2 rings. It's a massive disappointment for more hardcore players like myself that liked the added challenge of turning a corner and running into a skeleton or hollow on steroids that hits twice as hard. It takes a lot of the hardcore ""YOU WILL DIE"" mentality that's been a trademark for souls games away and instead changed it to ""YOU WILL FARM"". I suppose another small thing to note is that large portions of the game feel highly unpolished and rushed. Some areas are breathtakingly beautiful, while others are full of large portions of texture and mesh completely missing, leading to literal holes in the world. Not to mention the weird graphical errors people get where everything goes wire mesh and turns bright shades of purple and green. Or players body texture clipping through armor when you hold a specific type of weapon as a specific gender. Or the fact that on full release, bonfires were one of the most dangerous things in the game, as they would cause a graphics driver kernel crash if you're lighting setting in the options menu was set to anything above low. A real kick in the ribs to players with high end pc's capable of running the game at max settings but being forced to tweak on setting to avoid crashes. Or the fact that after shutting down the game and restarting it, the game had a tendancy to reset the lighting setting to the recommended, detected setting without your knowing, causing crashes that you thought you'd fixed. Another thing of note, is that the game runs like trash on console. It does not play at an acceptable framerate on PS4 compared to pc. Looking at one, then the other, the difference is almost physically sickening. As stated above, this is my personal opinion, and this review is subject to being edited if the game sees improvement. I wish I could recommend it, but I simply can't, and it pains me to say that. I hope you found something useful or helpful in my review before making a purchase. Have a nice day."
0,"TL;DR: The game is fun, the community isn't.I'm going to be 100% honest with you, the game is good. Really good actually. The combat is fun enough, the enemy design is unique and different from the first two games, the weapons are neat with the weapon abilities, and of course, it's very pretty graphic wise. But only if you play it offline, can you actually enjoy it. Do not make the same mistake I did in actually trying to co-op with a friend. You can't. You just can't. Dark Souls 3 is not a game meant to be enjoyed with a friend, it was never designed properly to be an actual co-op, online experience. And here's why:Invasions aren't something I complain about as a concept, they're not my favorite thing about the souls series but they're alright when they happen. Keywords: as a concept. This implies that no one would abuse such a system. This implies, that you'll actually be fighting people your player level, and skill level. This implies, that you wouldn't be fighting some dude with 9000+ hours, invading as a player level 10, with the best gear in the game.For people who need hand-holding, I'm talking about twinks. I'm willing to bet all the money in the world that the glowing, positive reviews, are written by these people who think this is actually enjoyable to newer players. As a new player, I'm telling you now, it's not. Not even a little bit. Don't even think about saying 'git gud', because there is no getting good against someone with amazing endgame gear at the very beginning. And the only way to counter a twink, is by playing offline. You cannot win against these people. And as far as I am concerned? These are the only people who are invading. And these people are the same ones, telling everyone 'iNvAsIoNs ArE iNtEgRaL tO tHe ExPeRiEnCe.' Then maybe, you should all go fight at your own soul level on your mains, where the invasion experience is actually an experience for both parties? I'm sorry if it's an actual challenge fighting against people who know all of your tricks up there at that level, but you are actively killing the community who actually kind of enjoyed the normal invasion experience.Again, Invaders are fine, I had the pleasure of fighting someone who was actually in normal gear, with a normal weapon, and a normal shield, where we duked it out. No lightning, fire, dark, poison, toxic, or bleed, just a regular fight. So, heed my warning, new players/returning players from other games, this game is built for invaders, not for co-op, and it will actively make you hate the entirety of the Dark Souls community, because they're all little toxic basement trolls who are worse then the League of Legends, Dota 2, and Counter-strike: Global Offensive communities combined, actively seeking to ruin your experience of the game. Play offline for the full, real experience of Dark Souls 3. But just to make it fun, I'll even allow comments, so you little twinkies can throw a fit in the comments, click the 'Not Helpful' button, and show everyone what terrible people you are, that you must validate your self through personal attacks.Edit: As fun as it was to draw twinkies out from their basement, to try and tell me how wrong I am, I think it just goes to further prove how abusive this community in particular is. I am disabling comments, as this community was wrathful, hateful, and abusive. I wish I could keep the comments up, but I do not want anyone to experience the amount of abuse I have over writing a simple negative review.It further proves my point that this community alone is the problem with this game. There were a few reasonable people, but I am pretty sure there is a sub-reddit or a group online somewhere, where these people gather to learn of anyone who reveals their secret, because the amount of twinks as opposed to rational, normal people that were commenting was truly disturbing. I never felt so attacled over writing a simple negative review simply describing my experience with the game and the people who play it.From Software really needs to do something about this. Like maybe matching people to hours played on steam, or some kind of thing to be able to match people to their time played with other people. It really is scary to think about the kind of reaction I gained out of these people for simply stating there is a problem."
0,"Extremely good game, however, an ongoing issue yet to be fixed or remotely addressed is the issue with hacking. In the last month, several issues with player's game being completely hacked into with malicious code that not only lets them into your game, but also your hard drive, SSD and potentially more. Check out the reddit for this game and its pinned post or some of the negative reviews below for more info. Great game, but probably one of the worst instances of hacking in terms of severity I've ever seen from a mainstream game that's being completely ignored."

But still no fix for DS3."
0,"A game that I went into expecting to hate and was pleasantly surprised. Dark Souls 3 is fantastic, but unfortunately at the moment I cannot recommend it because of the utterly broken anti-cheat system.Cheaters are currently able to (and quite easily so) get innocent players permanently banned, as well as forcibly modifying stats, wiping inventories, etc. As a result, the online is unplayable for anyone who doesn't want to risk having their save ruined and get permanently banned from the online as a result. As time goes on, cheaters doing this will get more and more common, until the entire community dies off. Until Fromsoft/Namco Bandai does something to remedy the situation, I cannot recommend this game, especially not at full price."
0,"Dont mistake my negative review for disliking the game, I personally think the game is fantastic. However a remote code execution exploit (or RCE for short)  has been discovered in the games netcode effectively making the game a virus for anyone who plays it online. This exploit allows anyone who invades your game or someone you summon to run code on your computer without your consent. This exploit can be used to simply crash someones game, or open up random programs on the users computer, steal private information, or even brick your PC.The community managed mod/anti-cheat Blue Sentinel has patched out the exploit and it is highly encouraged that you install the mod before playing the game. I have linked the mod below for convenience. https://www.nexusmods.com/darksouls3/mods/723While im thankful for the effort of the developers behind the Blue Sentinel mod and their speedy response in fixing the exploit, the community should not be responsible for making sure a product works and is safe for its user base this responsibility should fall on the developers and the publishers. I hope to see an official response from either Bandai Namco or Fromsoftware soon addressing the issue and insuring us this issue will not be present in the upcoming Elden Ring. Until then i cannot safely recommend a game that has the potential to harm your PC."
0,"An amazing game everyone should play at least once, but play offline, I'd rather eat broken glass than play the awful PvP system again, the starter areas are filled with individuals that use high-end gear to farm new players, usually putting them off the game permanently, it sucks. Oh, and don't forget the hackers. I've had some good experiences with the community, and I've also done what I can to add to that group, invading and giving people embers etc for free. However, good experiences online here are few and far between, avoid it like the plague and weep because we're definitely not getting any kind of private co-op mode for you to show your friends how great this game is without xX_NewbpWnAgE42069(InsertEdgyClanName)_Xx or 'shreklolXDXD' invading with a dark hand and caestus.Edit: 'You suck' and 'casul' is not a valid argument, especially when it takes no skill to stack buffs, equipment and stats for low SL invasion easy-mode time. I think you're a sad basement dweller if you feel the little endorphin high you get from winning an invasion matters in life, but the thing is, if you exploit new players for covenant items, YOU suck, not me.Edit edit: I believe in criticism quite wholeheartedly, but I'm also not very good with being spammed dumb insults in the comments section (although more depressing to read than good as insults). I thought I'd be able to handle that better, but it's just not something I am decent at it seems, which is sad because I really didn't want to disable the comments. Considered deleting the review but I think it's important to keep up as a little message on how idiots are ruining the online experience of a game that is otherwise what I'd consider the most immersive and fascinating fantasy universe ever written. Haven't received any constructive criticism to warrant keeping comments enabled, so, I'm sorry, I have anxiety, and not self-diagnosed, I gotta disable them so I'm not worrying about what's being said here 24/7 and tempted to reply to every 'git gud' or 'casul' comment."
0,"I absolutely LOVE this game, I have every item in the game as far as I know and I've completed every achievement. Sadly though, I've been false banned and now I can't even play with my friends anymore. It's a beautiful game but do beware, there's the ever so small group of people who get false banned. You could end up in that sliver of a statistic. Don't bother emailing support either because they just reply with automated emails and if you try to contact them again they threaten to perma ban you just for basically bothering them."

0,"===== Updated June 9, 2017 =====To follow up to some of the remarks and update on review: with last dlc and patch about half a year ago it seems like support for this game has come to the end. With Dark Souls: REMASTERED out I can recommend playing that one instead of this, since it got (in my opinion) much more solid mechanics in terms of design, even though in terms of functioning they may be not ideal (notorious lagstabs that are not as unfair as people would think, there is long explanation but it's for Remasterd review).Dark Souls 3 is certainly still a decent single player/co-op experience, but sadly in terms of gameplay it's an inferior game to past 2 (and now Remastered). PvP experience is still better in other entries. Perhaps if one day FROM decides to remaster DS3 and add back some of the cut content, as well as revert poise to how it used to work in past games, when that happens it will be indeed a superb experience on par with past 2 games. Untill then it's a subpar ""just more dark souls, kinda"" game.As for build diversity - weapons being worse or better is good for an RPG. But some weapons being drastically better to the point of making whole weapon classes redundant/obsoleteis not healthy balance.As for meta builds - sure you can play with almost any build through game, but as soon as you hit PvP you will have certainly much worse experience than you could running objectively better build.But even then you wouldn't really want to run a build with heavy armor since it doesn't provide you much but requires lots of investment. From being generally and pretty universally useful in past titles, Poise (which is found on heavier armor types) transformed into highly situational and niche stat that demands to be played around instead of supplimenting the way *you* choose to play. In past titles having more poise was a really appealing option, and there was meaningful choise - you could sacrifice some damage for poise and it would pay off since it's universally useful for about any kind of build (maybe except full on glass cannons/builds that are built around never ever getting hit). In DS3 poise only works on particular moves during those moves and generally is restricted to massive-heavy part of weapons spectrum. To make use of it you would have to build your playstyle around forcing hyper armor trades with your opponent, and any decently smart player simply won't trade with heavy armored UGS opponent, because it's obvious who will come out on top should they attempt trading blows. It's just really poor design.===== This review was last updated on July 6, 2016 =====This game could be one of the best Dark Souls games. Really it could. But there are some things that are done way worse than they were even in the least loved by DkS community DkS2.I've tried to do my best at condencing this review and updating it.Weapon movesets. After DkS2 you would expect to see cool, diverse and unique weapon movesets. Wrong! Welcome to next-gen DkS game, where all weapon classes have 2 movesets at best for all the weapons. Boss Soul weapons? Nope, same boring and sometimes even bad movesets. Same goes for weapon AR values: most weapons can be just infused for quality and use that way, that leads to another problem - complete lack of build and weapon diversity.One could argue that ""there are different builds!"". Yes there are mage builds for example. Could just as well cound fashion souls build too, or cosplays! Majority of players pick quality build, and for a good reason - it is the most effective and universal one. Ofc there are caster builds or dex/str builds but they are much more rare and compared to quality - simply suboptimal.Weapon arts - while some are OKish. some are just disgustingly bad. Scythe weapon art in particular - about same windup as fully charged heavy attack, but way less damage and requires FP. Landing ""headshot"" adds a little more damage, but it still does way less than charged heavy, having same windup and readability. Greatswords have same weapon art as straight swords mostly (so ye, same weapon art for 2 weapon types). I would any day pick DkS2 parry on Greatsword L2 over the awful weapon art.Weapons balance - a lot of weapons are just plain better than others. Same goes for some weapon classes. Ofc it is souls game so you can play with any weapon and win, but why play with sword ""A"" over sword ""B"" if latter is only different from the other in stat scaling and has completely identical moveset?Poise. There was a lot of drama about it, but I will keep it short. As of right now poise is extremely situational, and one could say that wearing heavy armor is heavily punished in this game by making player sacrifice stat point into completely useless otherwise Vitality (that requires ridiculous investment compared to previous games). Fact that some NPC enemyes have properly working poise only serves as more salt on injury. Poise in DkS2 was working almost perfect after all the tuning done, and now we have this.A big step back from previous game in itemization. In past games you could get all weapons or armor you could see in game, with extremely few exceptions. In DkS3 there are quite a  number of unobtainable armors and weapons you will never get, some of them were just cut and are still present in game data.Absolutely same NG+ and on. One of few things DkS2 did right was NG+. It added not just dull ""more hp, more damage"" difficulty, but also new enemy placement and harder boss fight mechanics. Here it's just +X rings that you can loot.Covenants feel really shallow and oversimplified. There are 2 covenants that autoinvade to kill players, and if you forget about phantom color and ""currency"" name they are essentially exactly same. 2 Blue covenants that are almost exactly the same except a gimmick difference which doesn't really make much difference (oh, and blue eye orbs gone, so prepare to enjoy sitting for hours waiting to get summoned). Red and purple covenants are pretty much the same as well if they invade with minor difference of purples having a bit more options on how to complete invasion.Regional matchmaking - absolutely useless. On PC game has 2 regions - Japan and not-Japan. So pretty much all this matchmaking does is filtering out Japaneese players (which is actually yet to be confirmed) if you happen to have it on. Other than that - Australian players will get matched with European players or NA players just as likely as players that are actually are in the same region.Patchnotes quality - average patchnotes for DkS3 look like this: ""We did some tweaking to Axes, changed Swords a bit, and did some other stuff we do. Also some adjustments were made to Rapiers. Go ahead and guess what we actually did.""Overall I'm really disappointed in how DkS3 turned out to be, sure it is great single player(ish) experience for 1 time, but it betrays what Dark Souls was in so many ways by completely discoraging invasions (because in majority of invasions you will be facing 2 or 3 or even 4 man ganks) and should you die you will also leave your souls on the spot you got killed as invader! There are no arenas, no interesting tech in PvP, really boring weapons and bland armor, and rather weak underlying game mechanics.My advice: if you want Dark Souls PvP - play Dark Souls 2: SotFS. If you want to experience another chapter of Dark Souls - sure, this game sure does deliver at least on that, but once you're done with it - you're done with game. It is so unlike previous games in longevity, but it is what it is.My rating for this game as Dark Souls fan is:As another chapter of world story/lore - 8/10As a Souls series game with multiplayer - 2/10I would recommend waiting for FROM to finally decide what they want to do with game and fix at least some of these issues and buy it once it will come with all DLC and some GOTY version. Untill then - Dark Souls 2 is better Souls game."

0,"Was pretty decent until I got the notorious ""Invalid data"" message and now I am basically doomed to a softban for having done nothing wrong. Great Anti-cheat guys, So good that it even gets those pesky players who don't cheat.Update : I have recently been cleared of this anti-cheating flag and can resume playing the game.However the story is not the same for everyone, and I have since lost interest in the game due to being afraid to play at all if it would result in a soft-ban, barring me from the part of the game I enjoy most. The base game is fantastic with a few balance issues and optimization issues that I would normally recommend to people. However there is a lingering fear that should you continue playing this game online that you will someday be flagged or worse, soft banned while playing legitimately and until that is no longer an issue I will keep this a negative review."
0,"as a person who has lots of sex all the time, i can say that this game is 100% accurate to having sex with sexy women. like i do. everyday. this game did not make me horny however. i am not gay. i just have too much sex with real women to spend more than 15 minutes in this game. on the other hand i would recommend this game to people who do not have sex (unlike me because i have lots of sex with women a lot) as there is a naked woman in it and she is naked. she kinda looks like one of my many girlfriends who i have sex with a lot. i have lots of sex. i also an very handsome and women ALWAYS want to have sex with me because i am very muscular and handsome and very good at video games. all my girlfriends say im very good at sex and playing video games and being handsome. one of my girlfriends asked me to have sex with her but i told her i was playing a sex game instead so she started crying and became a lesbian and killed herself because i did not have sex with her. i have sex with women. not men. i am not gay. i am very cool and handsome so girls always have sex with me because i am very cool and sexy. my penis is very big. all my girlfriends like my penis because it is very big and i am very good at sex with my women. every woman ive had sex with is very sexy and so am i. i have lots of sex. i am also very handsome and sexy and i have lots of sex."
0,"A dangerous remote code execution (RCE) exploit found in Dark Souls 3 could let a bad actor take control of your computer, according to a report from Dexerto. The vulnerability only puts PC gamers who play online at risk and may potentially affect Dark Souls, Dark Souls 2, and the upcoming Elden Ring. Servers for various Dark Souls games have since been shut down in response.The exploit was seen in action during The__Grim__Sleeper’s Twitch stream of Dark Souls 3 online. At the end of the stream (1:20:22), The__Grim__Sleeper’s game crashes, and the robotic voice belonging to Microsoft’s text-to-speech generator suddenly starts criticizing his gameplay. The__Grim__Sleeper then reports that Microsoft PowerShell opened by itself, a sign that a hacker used the program to run a script that triggered the text-to-speech feature.RCE IS ONE OF THE MOST DANGEROUS VULNERABILITIESHowever, this likely wasn’t a malicious hacker — a screenshotted post on the SpeedSouls’ Discord may reveal the “hacker’s” actual intentions. According to the post, the “hacker” knew about the vulnerability and attempted to contact Dark Souls developer FromSoftware about the issue. He was reportedly ignored, so he started using the hack on streamers to draw attention to the problem.But if a bad actor discovered this problem first, the outcome could’ve been much worse. RCE is one of the most dangerous vulnerabilities, as noted by Kaspersky. It allows hackers to run malicious code on their victim’s computer, causing irreparable damage, and potentially stealing sensitive information while they’re at it.Blue Sentinel, a community-made anti-cheat mod for Dark Souls 3, has since been patched to protect against the RCE vulnerability. In a post on the r/darksouls3 subreddit, a user explains that (hopefully) only four people know how to execute the RCE hack — two of which are Blue Sentinel developers, and the other two are people “who worked on it,” possibly referring to the individuals who helped uncover the issue.A representative for Bandai Namco, Dark Souls’ publisher, commented on a Reddit post in response to the issue, stating: “Thanks very much for the ping, a report on this topic was submitted to the relevant internal teams earlier today, the information is much appreciated!” The Verge reached out to Bandai Namco with a request for comment but didn’t immediately hear back. I recommend to download the blue sentinel mod, report this to the software devs, don't recommend dark souls to anyone and don't pre purchase Elden ring until Software takes this situation seriously."

0,"Good game, but is PLAGUED with hackers that teleport, force instant death animations, prevent you from using separation crystal (forcing you to force close the game) and in other cases completely wiping ALL of your progress That's right, a hacker can invade you and simply erase countless hours of progress from your character. They can also force actions on your character that makes the game detect you as a cheater, penalizing you and BANNING you from online forever even though you didn't do anything. While this hasn't happened to me there are plenty of cases of it happening. I cannot recommend the game until this is handled properly by FromSoftware. A system where fair players get banned and hackers continue terrorizing the community is unacceptable."
0,"Dark Souls 3 is a great game for all who loved the series, and is especially more forgiving to newcomers. The game has a greater focus on gameplay and less emphasis on story, which basically means less talking and more killing. The PC port brings us better framerate and graphics, and that adds to the beauty of this gem. I definitely recommend anyone who wants a game with great mechanics to buy this game and play it...Offline.On the PC port, the online gameplay is utter cancer. How so many hackers are allowed to roam free without any repercussions is beyond me. You will literally despise being invaded or invading players that either clip through attacks, have infinite FP or stamina, or just ghost through the entire area, literally unkillable. How Steam or From allows this nonsense to go on unchecked and letting these hackers get away with all this is beyond me. I'm all for the modding community that wishes to mod their game, BUT FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, LEAVE THAT FOR OFFLINE PLAY. Seriously, Steam...or From...anyone. Ban modded saves from being playable online and let people play in peace!....Oh. Other than that, this is a great game and you should definitely buy it for a great experience...Offline. Until those hacking bastards are banned from any online play."

0,"New hack just bricks your save, sending you to NG+ and locking you in the starting area.Totally trash level network security and lack of support plus unavoidable multiplayer = unacceptable. The new hack makes the game unplayable online, since some sociopath can just destroy your save instantly. A friend of mine and I have been looking forward to co-op on this for months after doing DS1 and DS2. The day before we were going to start, the hack went public and now cheaters are bricking save files left and right. Bandai/Namco+Fromsoft were apparently warned about this exploit years ago and didn't care, and I'd take odds that it's not going to be fixed now.The base game is pretty good (played it on the PS4), but the absolutely trash level indifference about years of cheats and hacking from Bandai/Namco+Fromsoft, culminating in this latest horrible hack, is unacceptable. If I hadn't bought this so long ago I'd just get a refund."

One word:HACKERS.The game is full of hackers using teleport, being impossible to touch (but they can heal their friends or kill you), players that insta kill you or put items in your inventory that will be detected as hacking and you'll get banned.So until the hacker problem is taken care of and permabans start happening, the game is not worth it.There are also other problems that make the game not worthwile if you plan to play online:LAGIt's unbearable. Luckily there's a matchmaking option but guess what: it doesn't work at all.Brazillian players will parry you no matter what.Russian players will teleport to your back.Japanese and Chinese players will hit you from the other side of the map.It's, literally, unplayable.

0,"This is a fantastic game that I would recommend to everyone, if not for one thing:The state of online play. The game is plagued by hackers, capable of not only instantly killing other players, but corrupting their game files, or getting them banned by inserting invalid data into their account. With the ability to invade another player's game, encountering these cheaters isn't even something you have control over. I've just recently been banned in online play because OTHER players are cheating. Apparently Bandai Namco's anti-cheat is incapable of stopping actual cheating, but punishes victims without any issue."
0,"They are actively working against the modding community by disabling family share preventing people from playing the game on alt accounts to avoid having their primary account banned for using mods that add more content to the game (like ""Champion's Ashes"" which adds a lot of cut items and bloodborn content to the game for PVP or ""Cinders"" which overhauls and rebalances the game. They might try to pass this off as something done to stop cheaters but they have been able to get other players banned without the anti-cheat tagging them for a long time. The choice of making this change right after a sale really makes it obvious that their trying to force players to pay full price if they want to use mods without banning their main account.and to rub salt into the wound, if a hacker adds illegal items to your character and gets it banned, it is permanently blacklisted from the servers, not even rolling it back will do anything."
0,"I just got the game so I don't have too much time into it yet, but I do want to express something important.  First, I love the Dark Souls games.  I feel they surpass most games in sheer artistic value and atmosphere and their ability to draw you into the game and make you care for it.   The art design guys should all get medals and baubles and goodly things.   I specifically wanted to give a not recommended vote here as a gesture and demonstration, because I think for an established franchise like this, that makes very good money, it's sheer laziness and unacceptable to refuse to make a decent PC port, with 2016 frame rates, and not forcing me to find a mod somewhere and use some crazy key binding so I can do some basic moves like jump attack or kick with my keyboard and mouse.  It's not like you haven't seen the comments EVERYWHERE since dark souls 1, come on, don't be cheap, don't be lazy, make it right.  Be a stand up game developer guy; say hey, we sell a lot of these games on Steam for the PC, so let's do it right, yes many play games with controllers even on the PC, but many don't, so let's give people an actual choice.  If some kid somewhere can make a mod to make this work, so can you.  Or better yet, pay the guy some money and buy his programming wizardry from him and put it in your game if you can't figure it out.   Now here's what I mean by lazy... the game recognizes I'm playing with a keyboard, because that's what I have in my settings.  So I'm walking around through the intro, where they have signs on the ground that tell you what buttons do what... and it's press triangle, press left bumper , press O, seriously?  It's that hard to change the message so it matches the actual device the game knows I'm using so it can give me the correct keys?  Heck I can do that for you and the only programming I took was some Basic and Pascal in College.  Give me 10 hours and a box of Twinkies and a connection to the net and I guarantee I can  fix that for you.  In conclusion, great game, and I WILL love it.  It's successful, and it deserves to be.  But be a standup developer guy, take a bit of that money, and make the game right for ALL the devices.  Thank you.  But yes, people should still buy it."

0,"This game is a very fun game, and I loved every second of it. However, FROM SOFT has ruined the game for me. 1. Softbaning. According to the anti-cheat software shoving its head up its ass I, and many, many other players, have been softbanned for no reason. CO-OP does not really exist for me any more, and apparently the invaders have given up on trying to get me as well. I'm basically playing a single player version of a multiplayer game because of some formatting error. On top of all that I deleted my main character because I thought it would fix the error message. So there goes 30 hours of my time, FROM, I hope you're happy. 2. Glitches. This game is riddled with glitches. Some of them allow enemies and other creatures to hop around the screen and attack you at lighning speed in seconds. It was not a framerate issue, it just happened for me. My game would sometimes give me delayed responces as well. Sometimes I would try to roll, but it would not happen. I did the most logical thing and tried to roll again, and I just ended up rolling twice. It was NOT a framerate issue. 3. Online Play. I'm not going to lie. My internet connection is not the best, but I get a decient ammount of bandwith that I have little to no trouble with playing other games in multiplayer mode. Most of, if not all, the games that I invaded orwas summoned into had Lagasaurous-Rex teir lag. Players would SLIDE across the screen in their idle position whilst making damaged gasps and attacking sounds. Enemies and BOSSES would revert to these stances whenever my host was attacked by them. It was incredably easy for me to backstab every enemy due to the extreme lag on FROM's servers. The worst part was the invaders and the bosses. Invaders would do the same thing as the host while attacking in their idle position. invasions turned into a spam fest because no one could tell what the others were doing. When bosses became like this I could not be damaged. I don't know if it was the fact that the boss was nowhere near me due to lag or the fact that an animation had to hit me to damage me. I don't know. However, the fact that this happened is outrageous for a game. Conclusion. Don't buy this game until it has been fixxed. Otherwise you may be banned for no reason, thus limiting the game, become frusterated when glitches ruin your fun, and generally become confused when everyone is in their freaking idle position."
0,"Steam still charging $60 for a game that still doesn't have online working and is 6 years old.Great game, but what the heck. Online content doesn't work, don't buy unless on sale. I don't know how you can charge full price for a game that's this old and missing content. Shame."
0,"I feel that this game should have answered questions and helped to wrap up the series. But instead the game is just littered with references to the other games, which would be fine if it was done in moderation. Also the overall linearity of the game and lack of viable build variety is going to ruin replayability. The only reason you'd have to replay the game would be to attempt completing the finicky ""quests"" which are so asinine that there's almost no point other than achievement hunting. If you're desperate for more Souls, I suppose you might enjoy this a little bit."

1,"I mean, what's there to say. It's Dark Souls. It's hard, but not as godawfully hard as the internet likes to proclaim it as. if you die, just get back up try again. Use your head. Be smarter than them. You've got infinite lives. Bosses don't have that. It's just a matter of time till you beat em. So keep your sword ready, pride in check, and head held high. It's a long journey friend, but it's not impossible. Praise the sun."

1,"I summoned a mad phantom with the intention of dueling him, but instead he sat down and offered to toast with me. We continued on throughout Undead Settlement together despite my wariness of him and he helped me take out all the mobs in the surrounding area. After a while, I became accustomed to fighting alongside my newfound friend and started turning my back to him knowing full well that he would protect me to his last, dying breath.We were a team. The best of friends, and nothing could stand in our way. He may not have been a Warrior of Sunlight, but Solaire's legacy thrived on within him. Jolly co-operation resumed until we neared the Curse-Rotted Greatwood...  And it was then that I decided to take yet another chance and summon a second Mound-Maker to see if we could rally him to our side.The plan seemed successful at first. But it wasn't long before I noticed some suspicious patterns in the phantom's movement, and his interest in my backside became a significant concern. My anxiety was proven justified when the phantom took a swing at me with his greatsword and missed.My loyal protector raised both his hand and his middle finger at the attacker, before charging forward with fury the likes of which none in Lothric had seen. He made it his personal duty to end the traitorous life of the one who would dare attempt to strike at me, and before long the violent fool was fleeing from our jolly wrath. He rushed up a ladder and leaped across rooftops before finally dropping a harmful distance to the ground, giving us an opening to attack. My companion launched himself from the rafters and his flowing cape waved majestically in the air as he readied his sword and plunged towards the infidel who would dare spit on the tenets of co-operation and sunlight.The valiant protector lunged his sword deep through the attacker's back before he could escape, the weapon grinding through bone and flesh and rendering him a lifeless husk. I dropped down following this, and we waved and spun our capes at one another in excitement and victorious glee.But this was the end of our time together. We gave each other one final wave before my friend's body started to fade away as he was whisked back to his own dimension. It hit me I'd never see him again."

1,"I was in a very dark place in my life, full of depression and anxiety. Then i downloaded and started playing Dark Souls 3.  My life totally changed and I'm in a much darker place now."
1,"After putting these many hours, I must say that this is one of the best, if not THE best RPG. Period.It's hard, yes. It has a steep learning curve, also yes. But this game is a rare gem among the simplified, straight-forward, linear games that are currently in trend. Rare indeed for a game that actually rewards you for patience and restraint and encourages players to slow down and observe the surroundings and the enemies. Of course, the same can be said about Dark Souls 1 and 2. But Dark Souls 3 is really much more refined than those in a good way. Relatively faster paced combat not only feels more fresh but I think is a necessary step forward in making the gameplay more interesting. Also, the enemies are much more aggressive to compensate for this faster paced combat. Though the lore does not appear to be on par with the one in Dark Souls 1, which I personally believe to be the best in the Souls series. But it is still well above Dark Souls 2, which I personally didn't like all that well.I could go on and on about this game, but for brevity I must say: Everyone must try this at least once."
1,this game wouldn't exist without Kentaro Miura. Rest in peace sensei

1,"There isnt any game that will make me feel as connected to my character as much as the Soulsborne Series has. But specifically, Dark souls 1-3.Now dont let my play time decieve you, ive easily played this 3-4x more than the playtime suggests (I also own it on PS4)As such is has a special place in my heart, it might not be the best game the bosses not as hard as some but i made a character and that character i have never had a better representation of my self in any game and ill explain why.In August 2012 i bought a copy of Dark Souls ""Prepare to die"" Edition. i was going through a hump and honestly retreated further back into video games than i did previously, I remember putting the game on my PC and dealing with the buggy Microsoft Windows Platform but i kept going, I made my character look like me like i always do after the back tingling sensation the opening cut scene gave me. The witches of izalith with thier chaotic flame, Gwyn smiting the dragons, Nito moving with his wrathful stance.And the Pygmy, With his Dark Soul. Sharing it with others. Humanity.From that moment i knew i was in for a hell of a good time. I was wrong obviously dark souls stomped me into the ground but eventually i got the hang of it, Buggy controls or not i had fun, Not just playing the game but reading desciptions of items trying to scrounge up what the lore ment and filling in the gaps that i missed. I wanted more and more, the story was great even if it wasnt offered up straight to you and you had to look for it, and i think thats probably why it was great.Miyazaki once said in an interview that he made dark souls in a similar way to what he experienced as a child, Growing up he had a lot of time alone and he spent it reading, He loved it but his favorite books were those about the knight who goes on daring quests to save a princess or slay a dragon and find treasure, However these books were in english and so he didnt understand them completely, a lot of the information was missing and he filled in the blanks with his day dreams of how HE wanted the story to go. imagining the hardships the knight must have gone through to get to where he was, and he couldnt have done it in a better way than what he did with dark souls, He made a community of people who feverishly try to fill in the blanks of the story even so complex that it makes your head spin.Then there was Dark Souls 2. I continued the fantasy and made my character look like me again, Making it a continuation of my characters story -SPOILERSIn dark souls 1 i chose to not light the flame and walked out to start the age of men, its my favorite ending and if i have the option its the one i always take so to me the story of drangleic was someone else managed to get through and continue the age of fire while i went off and disappeared for an undisclosed amount of time with a dope hat and a ton of soulsTo be fair Dark souls 2's story was lacking more than everyone expected but it was still a great game, the controls were more optimized so the game itself didnt seem as hard and the opening cutscene was great, i got goosebumps when the old firekeeper said ""And like a moth to the flame your wings will burn in anguish, Time and Time again"" and that was very true to the game we kept going for more even though you would get that angry sensation to just put it down and not pick it up. but you always do.Then theres Dark Souls 3. To me the true Dark Souls 2 is the third, a perfect continuation of the story from the first, probably due to Miyazaki having more influence on this game and not being distracted with a different project (Bloodborne if i recall) and it continued the story for me perfectly, from beginning to end Dark Souls 3 has made me feel like a bad ass, I always ALWAYS start Deprived (recommend it to everyone even if you're just starting) because i enjoy the feeling of starting from scratch and tearing my way through challenges to distract me from my challenges in life, i enjoy the struggle and Dark souls 3 Gave me a good fight but like every challenge its there to be completed. and with the release of The Ringed City and Dark Souls 3 : The Fire Fades  Edition the series will sadly be put to rest and to me it will go down in my history as the game that pulled me through depression because even though its hard when i felt like i couldnt accomplish anything in my life the Dark Souls franchise showed me that if i kept trying eventually i could pull through.SPOILERSAs im writing this im sitting in the Ariandel Chapel, I just finished collecting everything from The Ringed City, I killed Dark Eater Midir After a struggle and i gave the Blood of the Dark Soul to the Painting Girl. She is naming the Painted world after me in this burning chapel of forlorn souls. the final road in my journey through Dark souls. I have slain Demons and Dragons and Men. I Conquered Gods and Giants. And ive arisen from the ashes to Usurp the flame a final time. And now it all burns away. The age of Fire might fade. But the age of men begins in a cold dark and gentle place.Thank you Miyazaki And FromSoftware as a whole. For this trilogy, For the DLC. For the adventures and the times i spent jolly co-operating. For helping me pull through. For the Fantasy of Struggle. Thank you.Thank you for the attention this review has gotten, i also editted it a bit so the Spoilers wouldnt be visible unless you hovered over them im sorry to the people who read them before i decided to use my brain and format it properly."
1,"Some people say, that Midir is the hardest boss, but the naked guy who invaded and killed me 20 times in a row thinks otherwise"
1,"Born too late to explore the earth,Born too early to explore the universe, Born exactly the right time to play this masterpiece.. 10/10"
1,"It finally clicked. Now I get why the Dark Souls series has such an active, enthusiastic, and borderline obsessed community. Although I was hesitant to start Dark Souls 3, I can now say that it is one of the greatest gaming experiences I have had.  Absolutely gorgeous. It was clear that a lot of thought and effort was put into designing Dark Souls 3. Each area uniquely beautiful and expertly put together; the attention to detail creates a truly immersive experience. I especially enjoyed how spectacular the scenery and menacing the bosses are. The developers did a great job at incorporating shortcuts. Since the areas are quite large, you often get disoriented as you progress (especially during the first playthrough). At a certain point, you come across unlockable door(s) or elevator(s) that connects to a previous area and acts as a shortcut. The sudden realization that you went around in one big circle or that you’re directly above/below a previous area always left me baffled. I really wonder how much time was put into the level design. Amazing combat. Honestly, I’ve barely skimmed the surface when it comes to combat but it is enough for me to recognize how incredible it is. There are so many weapons, movesets, spells, infusions, and more. Plus the combinations you can put together are only limited by your imagination (for the most part). There is a reason why several people spend hours putting together the perfect PVP character(s).Exploration is greatly rewarded. Seriously, there are items, NPCs, and interesting rooms hidden everywhere. It’s gotten so bad that I feel paranoid when I reach a pointless dead end and find nothing - “there HAS to be something here”. Finding a secret felt like finding candy on a scavenger hunt and was thrilling from beginning to end. Keep a look out for fake walls, suspicious ledges, potential jumps, and chests. Beware of mimics though.I really liked the decision to grant the ability to teleport between lit bonfires almost immediately, and to include a safe hub (Firelink Shrine), where most of the important NPCs/vendors can be found. This made Dark Souls 3 more user-friendly (especially for beginners) than Dark Souls 1. Although this made Dark Souls 3 more linnear, I found the clarity of knowing more or less what to do and where to go (also being able to teleport back in case you went the “wrong” way) more enjoyable than the uncertainty I felt when playing the first Dark Souls. For those who don’t know, inter-player interactions play a large role in the Dark Souls series. You can leave notes (to either help or trick others), you can summon other players for a co-op experience, and you can invade other people’s worlds for PVP. I think this is another reason why the Dark Souls community holds strong - despite being portrayed as a single player game, you are rarely alone. I found that the online features (co-op and PVP) worked very well most of the time. Naturally, there are some instances of lag or disconnection, but it is very easy to set up again. Initially I hated being invaded, but I’ve learned to love it for two reasons: The excitement/fear you get from being invaded is intense. It is like a sudden emergence of a mini-boss whose only purpose is to hunt you down. While the defeats are definitely sour, victories are so damn sweet. All the pain you receive from getting invaded can be repaid by invading other people. It’s a sort of S&M relationship, I know, but it adds near-infinite extra hours of excitement and replayability to Dark Souls 3. I’m kind of torn about this following point. On one hand, I still find that Dark Souls 3 is not very beginner friendly. More specifically, I had to look up some basic guides before starting the game to understand which stats do what, and what sort of build I should go for. A lot of information, for example stat soft-caps, is not particularly clear to begin with. I find that this steep learning curve, in addition to Dark Souls’ notoriety for being difficult, pushes a lot of beginners away. On the other hand, the Dark Souls series has come a long way, 3 being the most user-friendly and clear game in my experience. After playing it, I realized that I could have easily learned how to build my character through a little trial and error. Granted, my character would not be perfect, but like many veterans say: “no point in Vigor is wasted”. Dark Souls is the kind of game that expects you to pour countless hours in to before you “git gud”, such that a veteran with awful equipment will almost always beat a beginner with God-tier equipment. It should be emphasized that YOU ARE EXPECTED TO MAKE MISTAKES; the complexity of Dark Souls 3 is exactly what makes it so spectacular. I was honestly hesitant to begin playing Dark Souls 3, but it has quickly become one of the greatest gaming experiences I’ve ever had. If you are on the fence, I urge you to give Dark Souls 3 a try. Be patient, learn from your mistakes, and don’t give up - only then will you prosper and praise the sun. NOTE: I’m not complaining about combat/mechanics difficulty - while challenging, I honestly believe that the death/learn-from-your-mistakes system is the number one selling point of the whole series. Would die again."

1,"You'll try. You won't know what's going on. You'll think dying is bad. Your friends will explain things to you, using words like, ""Estus shard"" and ""Praise the sun"" and it won't make sense. You'll give up after dying repeatedly on the tutorial boss only to finally kill it and then die to a dog that scares you into falling off of a cliff. Three months later, your friends will convince you to play again. You try it out, only to fail yet again. This time though, you understand that's part of the process, just as your friends had reassured you. You'll roll. You'll roll again, then again. You've done it! The dog that once scared you into jumping off a cliff is dead and you've miraculously taken no damage. Renewed vigor fills you and you continue on. This time you ignore your friends, resorting to the wiki to answer your questions and your own curiosity to guide you to treasure. Suddenly things begin to make sense. You go to bed.You wake up with this incessent urge to play again, oddly intrigued by the story even though you're ""not that type of gamer"". ""Why do I enjoy this?"" You'll ask yourself. Soon, you're rolling in real life, to dodge your responsibilities solely to play this game.Didn't think it'd happen to me. It did. Buy it while it's on sale so the first three months of you not really playing it don't feel like, ""Such a waste of money."" It's not a waste, even at full price. Amazing game and story. So damned confusing at first but it's worth it. I promise you."

1,"Dark Souls III, The one game i managed to get over 1500 hours on.Where to start with this...Short VersionThe Pros- Engaging gameplay- Beautiful scenery and soundtrack- Tons of replayability- Varied PVP With both strangers and friends.- Co-op with strangers and friends, to get past those pesky dogs- Memes that may or may not give conniptionsCons- Connectivity may sometimes be an issue when fighting strangers- Requires patience and determination, not for the easily angered.- Difficulty may be a turnoff for people who enjoy more casually toned games- Those people who use a greatshield with great magic weapon in pvp(Skip to bottom for roundup)Long VersionAs someone who has enjoyed the Dark Souls series thoroughly, I feel that Dark Souls 3 has fixed many control issues apparent in previous installments. The combat feels active, rewarding proper timing and enemy management, whilst punishing rushing into battle without a plan and carelessly swinging your blade around. Enemies are placed strategically across the levels, neatly tieing in with their surroundings and backstories. It feels like all of them have a reason to be where they are. Surroundings are interesting, and tell their own little part of the story.The bosses are their own kind of combat. Whilst in the levels themself the challenge is in enemy management, and level exploration. The bosses give you a one on one (usually) death battle, where careful dodging and reading your enemy's movement is key to surviving the encounter. They are larger, stronger and faster then any other enemy in the game, and are not to be taken lightly. Defeating these formidable foes is quite the challenge, and also very satisfying. About the story: you will have to look for it. Although DS3 doesnt hide its story as much as the previous titles, Item descriptions, surroundings and NPC dialogue are essential to finding out what exactly is going on in lothric. Finding all these tidbits of lore makes it exciting to find new weapons and/or items, aside from their obvious use. The singleplayer aspect is fun enough on its own, but the multiplayer aspect makes it whole. being able to summon both strangers and friends to aid you in your journey makes each journey different. Naturally, recieving more aid makes the enemies tougher, along with other risks, like multiple invaders. the arena is always full with people at almost any level, providing unlimited entertainment as players duke it out 1 on 1, or in teams.All in all, its a experience that changes from person to person. with bountiful amounts of weapons to choose from, and more armor than one sane person could collect. theres endless combinations of character builds at your disposal. knights, mages,  pyromancers and clerics, and combinations in all forms. Ive ran through the entire game over 60 times at this point, finding new secrets and tidbits of story still. and with PVP being one of the most entertaining things i have ever come across. The enemies, story, soundtrack and scenery are a joy to return to whenever i launch this game.(continue here for roundup)Basically, if youve played the first two games, youll find a familliar yet refreshing style of gameplay before your eyesIf DS3 is your first dark souls, Youll find a easy to learn, difficult to master game that will keep you busy for quite some time.Overall, I think this is my favorite game in my entire library."

1,"This is my first souls game.I bought this game on a Wednesday night after work when it was on sale. I ran through the cemetery hacking and slashing undead with ease. With the utmost confidence, I took the sword out of the kneeling titan and was promptly returned to reality. Several times. So many times that I returned the game that night saying it ""wasn't my cup of tea""But a little voice lived in my head. It called me a quitter. Quitters never win.Long story short I bought the game again in the same night and played until I beat him. Feeling victory in this game is exhilarating.

1,"the more you fight, the more you die, the more you die, the more you learn, the more you learn, the more you live.  Dark souls will grind you to dust and reform you a dozen times, and thats all before the first boss fight.  If you've never played dark souls before, and you get stuck on the first fight, dont rage quit, after all, dying 40 times in a row is just a nice introduction to the game.  good luck.  youll need it."
1,"It's hard to capture what makes this game so special to me and many other people.  How something so bleak and frustrating can be so therapeutic and comforting.  A contradiction?  Of course not - we're human beings.I will tell you a tale of my first experience with this game.  I played for a total of about 10 minutes before quitting and deeming it a waste of my time.  I'd not played anything like it before, and I'd much rather be spoon fed easy hits of dopamine in my downtime.  Wasn't life already stressful enough?A few years later, seemingly out of nowhere, I acquired an inclination to play it again.  I'm not sure why.  It was the beginning of Fall, the season of transformation between the omnipotent oppression of summer heat and the still nothingness of Winter.  I can't help but see Fall as a parallel evolution of us.I gave it another chance, and I'd never been so engrossed in a game until that point.Each time you die, you are given a chance to further refine your skills and strategy as your character journeys through a satisfyingly varied and strange fantasy world.  Often times there are stark contrasts between the areas you encounter, most notable being the transition from the dark, brown, cavernous catacombs to the blue galaxy-like sky overlooking the gothic architectural city of Irithyll.Things are eerily quiet when navigating the environments.  It's just you, your thoughts, and if it's your first playthrough, the simultaneous hesitancy and curiosity of seeing a new and grotesque creature with an unknown moveset that will most likely destroy you fairly quickly if you can't stand back and first observe the patterns.And then you get to the end of this level, this mini-world of creative genius, and enter the fog gates.  The previous silence and stillness transforms into some of the most beautiful orchestral music you've heard as you encounter a terrifying entity whose health bar fills the entire width of your computer monitor.  Your heart rate increases and you fight for your life.  And you most likely die a glorious death, perhaps several times.  But you awaken, and you have the chance to do it again and again until you beat the boss, or you let the boss beat you.You have several starting classes to choose from, as well as a diverse set of weapons, armor, rings, items, magical spells, and elemental infusions.  How you mix and match all of this creates your own unique build that you will hone for the rest of your journey, using the souls of those you slay to increase your own attributes.  This alone is one of the funnest aspects of the game for me.  Your first build will probably be less than ideal, but with each subsequent playthrough, you get to start again.  Whether you choose to bring your character into an ever increasing NG+ cycle or start anew with a fire wielding pyromancer of great intelligence instead of a greatsword carrying warrior with the power of strength is up to you.  Immense replayability in a world that begs to be explored and mastered.And by the way, you can always summon a few more ashen ones to help you in your struggles.So now that you know DS3 is a magnificent game, in my opinion at least, I wanted to touch on a great lesson that this game imparts, and that serves as yet another reason to pick it up.Something about the Soulsborne series serves as a therapeutic outlet for people.  You can read dozens and dozens of stories online about how playing these games helped people in some facet of their life while they were going through a difficult time, often struggling with mental illness and apathy.  Some will outright say that playing a souls game changed their life.  Perhaps this sounds silly - after all, isn't it just a video game?In our modern world, most of us are used to comfort.  We welcome the immediate gratification of a scroll through Instagram, and many are hesitant about pushing themselves and putting in the work to solve problems and make painful changes.  I'd argue that DS3, and other souls games, teach you the lessons of grit, persistence, and endurance that you can take with you and apply to any other endeavor that you choose to undergo.Getting satisfyingly good at something usually takes hard work.  When you see someone flawlessly play a piece of classical music on the piano, you are seeing the result of this.  What you're not seeing is the journey.  The struggle of beginning from nothing with no skills or prior knowledge and having to potentially deal with setbacks and self doubt each session of practice.  But to get to the end and achieve your goal, you have to deal with these challenges.  Embrace them even, seeing them as a necessary component for the end that needs to be reached.This journey of being brought into existence - weak and with nothing other than our own ""starting stats"" - as we progressively strengthen ourselves and undergo trials and tribulations to defeat the final boss and link the flame: this is an abstract parallel to our own mortal life in many ways, and is the thing that makes DS3 so beautiful and captivating to me.If you've gotten to the end of this melodramatic wall of text, thank you for reading, and I hope I've convinced you to give this game a try."
1,"Dark Souls is - and always has been - acquired taste. Out of all my friends on Steam, most of whom I know personally and share interests with, I can count those who play Dark Souls 3 on a single hand.When I first heard of Dark Souls, I would have never believed I would spend hundreds of hours on one of the series' games. I was intimidated by the difficulty and attempts to complete the first title resulted in frustration and anger. I felt inadequate, because the setting appealed greatly to me, but I wasn't very proficient at the combat mechanics, which force you to critically analyse your surroundings, memorise attack patterns and generally be cautious. And that's where that ended back then.Then, Bloodborne came out and immediately grabbed my attention and renewed my interest in games of the Soulsborne franchise. It was actually the first of the games I completed.Here's the deal: These games reflect upon your ability to deal with a variety of situations. They reflect whether you are able to handle loss, whether you can keep a cool head in a tight situation. So maybe, you are very impulsive, make decisions on the fly and maybe everything turns out okay every once in a while. But are you able to bear the guilt of your failures, the fact that you have made a mistake? If not, you will rage, you will become frustrated or even doubt yourself. You'll throw controllers and shout at the screen, just as much as you might feel the frustration pulse through you in any situation in life. But can you improve? That is a clear yes. It's definitely possible, but you have to be willing. And overcoming a seemingly unsurmountable obstacle through great effort, training, and self-reflection is a wonderful feeling.Giving you control of a character that seems to be so severely underpowered in a world of giant beasts and magnitudinous god-creatures is intimidating. But along the way you will find that any God may have its weakness and a character that seems weak at first may have unforeseen strengths. The only thing you can rely on is yourself and your willingness to learn and persist, or you may lose your sanity. Everything in this world is supposed to make you feel small, weak and endangered, but you have it in your hand to change the perception you have of yourself.Will you like this game? That depends on you. Are you willing to give yourself a chance?"
1,"Yes, indeed...Like every journey eventually leads to home, this great series eventually came to a close. Paying respect to its predecessors, tying up loose ends and building the last scene of greatness. The final hymn to the flame.Dark Souls has always been a story about a dying world filled with collapsing creatures and the feeling of despair. We are wandering through crumbling buildings and decaying lands. We are finding shards of past glory and witnessing heartbreaking stories of men. We are trying to fit them all into a single picture, sometimes imagining our own stake. But this time we also find things that are familiar to us, thanks to the previous games. This time we become a part of that story, which is long past. The heartwarming allusions to the things we already know and love, that are the reason to smile in this somber world.Should it be your first Souls game, then your journey will be enhanced by a different thing. Unexpected discoveries, facing the consequences of your actions, feeling lost in a cruel world with no explicit directions. Failures and misperceptions, and, eventually, glorious victories await you. Don't ruin it and go in blind. This is the once in a lifetime experience that only a Soulsborne game can give you. The experience that is yours only, unique and personal.But for me it became my final step on my Souls journey. Once again I came to a mysterious world to witness its monumental architecture and stunning landscapes, to uncover its secrets. Once again I was charmed by the beauty having purpose. Once again I was a feeble creature, struggling its way forward. The learning process in these games is subtle, yet powerful. It showed me how hope replaces despair and how cold-blooded patience prevails rage. The fire will fade. But our memories will remain. My journey is over, but I know that I will return again and again. Ever since I played the first one of these games, I was doomed: they became my all time favorites. And DS3 lived up my expectations to the fullest. I don't think that any other (non-FromSoft) game can surpass or even achieve that for me. I might be a lost soul now, but to be honest I don't mind this fate. I think that the theme of this game also conveys another idea: everything should end so something new may be born. FromSoft wanted to show us that Dark Souls is over and we should look forward to their new creations. Therefore here I am, eager to see what they will show us next. I doubt you could even imagine it. Because I certainly can not."
1,"Before I played dark souls 3, i had a small wee wee, no friends, no girlfriend, depression and absolutely no will to live. None of these things have changed, but the game is pretty good."

1,"When people talk about the Souls games they always say they are hard. But unlike the arcade horrors from the last century they are not only hard, but also fun. There is something to it to walk into the boss room knowing that you are the underdog. But there is also a fantastic and beautiful world. A variety of different cool weapons and spells. And the best part is that you can summon a friend or random people and npcs to help you on your journey when it's getting too frustrating. The harder the battle the sweeter the victory. Or how we say it: Praise the sun!"
1,"Recently I was asked by a friend who is new to the souls series what i thought of this game, so I thought I'd put what i wrote him here.This game is a masterpiece.I'd recommend it, but I will say its hard, like it can be discouraging at times.However, there are few feelings that come close to the sensation of defeating a boss or enemy you've been stuck on for hours.TL:DR= Beautiful game, challenging but rewarding fighting system and a non intrusive but intriguing narrative to boot. 9/10Ill keep the review brief so you can skim through it, because, honestly, you've got to experience the game for yourself to fully comprehend what this game is about.Story= Vague (left to interpretation sorta' thing) but intriguing. You're character seems to be the only one out of the loop and it really helps cement the idea that youre not ready for the grand task you've been given. You'd expect alot of satisfaction from the end of the game, however the real story chunks are tucked away in item descriptions and in the connotations of NPC's.Visuals= F***ing fantastic. Graphics are great even on low settings and this mystical middle age setting looks so fucking incredible. The world is detailed and reinforces the main story with hints of the impennding doom that a dark age will induce. Oh, and fashion souls is real, and trust me you're going to spend a lot of time making your character look badass.Gameplay= Toughest part. Easy to learn, hard to master. The levelling system require stat placement which means various builds can be created with various intended functions: from melee builds to caster builds to healing builds. Some styles are more forgiving than others and others require late game items/bonuses/spells to properly flourish. There are, of course, Meta builds that perform pretty well but everyone will also be trying to perfect there own build.Online= Fantastic. Community is still pretty big for PvE and PvP but, the game is getting getting old now. Co-op is great and can be used through most of game (minus something like 3 transitory areas that dont really have anything important in them). Invasions are what made dark souls work: getting invaded and winning a duel makes you feel powerful if its a 1v1. Invading can be unforgiving because of gank squads (2+ players who corner single invaders) but it can be so rewarding when you pull of a whole squad kill and you get to do the infamous 'point down' gesture. PvP has its own arena if invading gets tiresome, so thats a plus. But high wait times if your not around the meta level in arena (Soul level 120 is the recommended meta range). General PvP can be alot more frustrating than other games but alot more rewarding. Mistakes can be unforgiving and there is a big issue with the lag in fights. However, for a guy who I know likes to feel the flurry of a good fight, this s*** delivers. Highly tactical gameplay that rewards smart decisions and good spacing. Dont get me wrong, the arena is useful for easy matchmaking but theres a whole pvp system called fight clubs where players gather in a non dlc area to do 1v1s (fair warning: there are no real rule enforcement in fight clubs so you just gotta' act honorable and hope your fighting compatriots do too and not gank you).Thanks for reading, this has been my first review on steam so I hope its clear and legible :)I look forward to invading you, and may the flames guide thee!"
1,"If you didn't enjoy the quality of Dark Souls II and are wondering about the enjoyment of Dark Souls III and the fact that it may be overhyped, worry no longer.Dark Souls III is the true successor to Dark Souls.The third entry in a game series renowned for its outstanding unique storytelling and its sinister difficulty, FromSoftware has brought us again another game worthy of praise. Taking place in the land of Lothric, you will encounter grotesque beasts of the unknown, epic bosses, the most beautiful environments and a lore deeper than any ocean. If you are tired of hand-holding games where the game seems to shove tutorials in your face even to end-game than this is the game for you. One of the reason that I hold Dark Souls in such high regard is not because of the difficulty but rather the fact that it doesn't treat the player as if they're a child. The game will punish you but know that it doesn't mean the end, rather every death you face is nothing more than a stepping stone to a greater success, a hard earned success is honestly the greatest feeling ever. You will learn new skills and eventually adapt, the game knows you aren't stupid and will treat you like you are; a human, something a lot of games these days are sorely missing.Again, Dark Souls III feels more like a sequel to Dark Souls I than II ever did. Borrowing things from all their previous games you will see happy changes to the overall game. Fans of Demon Souls will be happy to know that the hub world shares an uncanny resemblance to the Nexus as well as the Maiden. Extremely well designed bosses inspired from the creatures of Bloodborne and its engine as well as Dark Souls II's accessibility to the series.    CAMEOS! Returning characters will make appearances.    Extremely well optimized.    Keyboard and Mouse controls aren't that bad.    There is now no permanent health loss when dying.    Amazing soundtrack that will soothe your ears.    Extremely well designed boss fights.    Full of amazing locations to explore.     Great level design.    Rewarding difficulty.    Playing CO-OP with a specific player is very easy now.    Stances. Combat has been reworked for the better.    No more Soul Memory.    Interesting NPCs, to encounter and converse with.    PVP is better than it ever was.    Classes don't lock you into anything, you can make your build into anything you want, e.g. magic user.    World fits together nicely in a way that makes sense.    Open world, areas are massive.    Approachable systems, deep and very easy to learn and master.    Mage builds are rethinked, they aren't as broken and overpowered like in Dark Souls II.    Matchmaking is a breeze.    This is NOT the final Souls game.    BACKSTABS ARE BACK! At the very least better executed than in Dark Souls II.    You can easily switch between OFFLINE mode & ONLINE mode now.    Though rarely, at the moment there is a few framerate hiccups but other than that PC version is very well done.    Somewhat noticeable pop-ins.    The world isn't inter-connected like in Dark Souls I which may upset some.    CAMEOS! Though I've written it as a plus, some may dislike it as some may think of it as lazy where From could've very well created new and interesting characters.    Not necessarily a negative but having an unstable connection while online will bring you back to the main menu.  Yes, very much so! Though I am biased, this is truly an amazing game. It doesn't matter if you are a veteran, new or old, Dark Souls III takes the best part of all of From's previous games and makes it even better. It surpassed my expectations, even more it completely destroyed what I should expect from a game. All upcoming games, Triple A especially take note, this is how you make a game. This is a true game.Thank you kindly, Alex for giving me the chance to play this wonderful game."
1,"easy game to play, fun, and I haven't gotten mad once! definitely a game that's made for beginners and I believe that anyone can play this game and have fun."
1,the greatest game none of my friends play
1,my wife left me
1,Game that saves you from a cruel world and depression...by placing you in a cruel world full of depression.
1,This game has destroyed my life. I am doing no hit runs now and I can't escape it anymore. I am trapped forever in this game. 10/10.
1,"I believe Dark Souls series are more attractive to people who are depressed or recovering from traumatic experiences.In a world without fire or light, a powerless man who does not have any strength, fails over and over. Yet, with relentlessness and determination, he becomes strong enough to overcome the mountains that seemed unsurpassable before. All these efforts are only to keep the fire lasting for just a little while longer. Do any of these sound familiar to you?I would not dare to say it could cure depression or other mental illnesses. But I do know that I gain some courage from this game. Thank you, Hidetaka Miyazaki."
1,The fire keeper is hot
1,"This game (and perhaps DS1) has ruined every other game for me. Since I've started playing the Souls series, I have not been able to fully get into any other game. I'll start playing something else, but am always thinking about yet another way to play this game. Building yet another character (why oh why can I only have 10) using a different weapon and style of play. People ask me whether I get bored playing it again and again. For me it is no longer about level design but rather about discovering new ways to play and challenge myself. For me I feel there will never be another game like this."
1,Like getting rammed up the ass repeatedly until you learn to like it.
1,Social life? Work? Sleep? Say goodbye to these luxuries and prepare to become hollow!
1,It's a game... It's a good game... You should buy it.

1,"This game is:10% luck,20% skill,15% concentrated power of will,5% pleasure,50% pain,and a 100% reason to purchase the game."
1,the game which began with Demon Souls and evolved with Bloodborne has achieved its ultimate glory.Dark Souls III has the best ending for the Age of Dark Souls.It's hard for me to say...But now these souls need a long rest...
1,"great game but it feels empty without the funny message man going ""try finger, but hole""pls bring back servers so new players like me can have a whole package experience instead of just getting half.also port bloodborne to pc im not paying $300 for one game that runs in 30fpsEDIT: LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO"
1,"Yes, indeed. Dark souls 3 is a game where you will soon learn you aren't as strong as that big scary creature over there, but you can sure kick its' ass if you try hard enough.For those who have played and enjoyed any previous games within the Souls franchise except for Dark Souls 3, I can easily recommend this game and you'll know exactly what you're in for.For those who haven't played any Souls games before, well, let us begin shall we?-Not for the faint of heart, because you will die, A LOT. Just get back up and try again!-You will even die when you do things correctly, because Dark Souls don't give a f*ck.-Your veins and brain will be filled with adrenaline and dopamine upon a successful boss kill after dying as many times as you have.-You'll get invaded (a form of PvP within Dark Souls) and rekt accordingly, increasing your urge to win next time, or exact revenge by invading someone yourself.-You'll die some more, but you'll learn new concepts and mechanics along the way. Ensuring you kick that much more ass the next time around.On a more serious note, DS3 offers:-Gorgeous visuals-A much more balanced PvP system than the previous two Souls games-Very difficult enemy and boss encounters-A some what complex ""fill in the blanks"" lore/story-telling which is fairly compelling under the surface9/10 - I simply love all the Souls games and would recommend them to anyone who is looking for a difficult RPG to play."
1,"Dark souls III : Door does not open from this side, is a fantastic casual RPG about trying to open doors, realising they do not open from this side, and then trying to find the right side to open the door.There's also a fun mini game about trying to become the lord of cinder10/10"
1,"whoever gave me 73 ember while invading me as dark spirit, thanks."
1,I have lost at least 6 SL200 characters to system failures or save corruption. I will continue to remake characters and grind them up until the inevitable heat death of the universe.
1,try finger but hole
1,"I'm not the type of person who plays these kinds of games. Until now, my taste has mostly been MMOs, Space sims, and games like Stardew Valley. Action oriented games that involve reacting fast, dodging, memorizing attack patterns (besides scripted raid bosses), this is all totally outside my element. I wanted to preface with this so you can see where I'm coming from. This review is aimed toward people like me. Where once I was a carebear even in MMOs, I now even dabble in invasions and PVP here. I even killed an invader once! Me! Where once I played video games purely to relax, I now have a taste for gaming experiences that make my heart pound. Where once I would uninstall a game I couldn't beat because I ""clearly wasn't good enough"", I now understand I have the potential to GET good enough, and that the process of realizing this potential is something core to my desired gaming experience. Where once I would dismiss a game outside of my comfort zone, I now eagerly approach a fresh challenge. This is all thanks to Dark Souls III, and its punishing-yet-fair gameplay. Every challenge you encounter is surmountable. Even if you're me. The distances between bonfires where you rest are perfectly placed. Just when you think you can't possibly make it much further, right around the corner you'll reliably find that sweet sweet bonfire. Dark Souls III rightfully believes in your ability to make it to the next one. And it's never wrong.The boss fights are an extension of this. Everybody can beat these bosses. The game cultivates your skills by presenting you with enemies with varying strengths and weaknesses, and by the time you reach a boss, you will have been hardened by the road leading up to it. You just have to try, and try, and learn. I can do it, you can do it. Trust. (Admittedly I haven't fully completed it, but I'm confident I will. As of writing I'm at Prince Lothric. Give me a few more tries!)This sense of growth and progress permeates throughout every aspect of the game. You'll improve both in strength and skill. Those red-caped Lothric Knight bastards that I used to be terrified of fighting? They're now something I casually farm with comfort and ease when I need some embers, effortlessly dodging and 3-shot-killing from behind. Those long corridors full of deadly traps and deadlier enemies, where I'd trudge through sweating at 0.001 mph? I effortlessly sprint through and past all the enemies, making a beeline to a now familiar destination. The game presents you with beautiful vistas that tower over the landscape that you've just fought through. It's often an emotional experience to see how far you've come, in so many ways.It seems silly to say that a video game can change who you are as a person, but this one did that for me. My attitude has changed. I can take on any challenge if I truly set my mind to it, and I will be happy to do so. I now know the glorious taste of a hard-earned victory, sweating buckets through my palms, filled with pride and joy in conquering a terrifying foe. That's what Dark Souls III is all about to me. It's a terrific game, but an even more terrific experience. You will come out the other side of this game as a different type of gamer if you have a casual carebear background like mine. If you're nervous about games like this, that's the exact reason you should play Dark Souls III. It can change you and open you up to a new world of experiences. Isn't that what life is all about?"
